            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, where the land stretches out in vast tapestries, lies the small town of Michigan. A place where fields yield to quaint tourist hamlets, and the notion of sprawling city malls and chains like Wal-Mart or Target remains a distant echo. Here, every journey demands the road. And yet, this is among the world's most beautiful places, flanked by waters on all sides. The town itself, cradled between the mighty Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. A place where the shoreline is never far, and the sands invite the weary to wade in.\n\nOur neighborhood speaks the language of small-town America. Homes stand apart, not pressed together like the crowded bricks of a cityscape. These are no uniform dwellings; each bears its own story. Some are old, having seen the years pass, while others wear the newness of renovation. Basements, full and visible from the street, anchor these houses, many clad in the armor of aged aluminum siding. All colors of the spectrum paint the blocks around my home, a patchwork quilt of humanity. Each house with its own little realm, yards adorned with trampolines and swing sets. Gardens bloom, fences contain the creatures that share our lives. Middle America, they call it. A place of earnest folk, toiling through the days, nurturing families or watching them grow.\n\nOn any day, children race along the streets, laughter echoing between the homes. Dogs with eager tails lead their humans on walks, bicycles roll, and rollerblades whisper over the pavement. Neighbors know each other here, woven into the fabric of community. A wave from the grill, a nod from the dog walker a few blocks down. The lawns are kept, leaves of autumn are not left to languish. Grass, green and tamed, bushes and plants trimmed and tidy. This is not a neighborhood of grandeur, but one of warmth. A place where families find solace, where the quiet and the calm weave a tapestry of safety. The kind of place where you feel the world has provided a haven at the end of the day.\n\nA short walk finds the county sheriff’s department and jail, a sentinel of order. The health department stands beside it, a bastion of care. Down the road, the city recycling center hums with purpose, serving the people diligently. Nearby, the crack of bat against ball rings out from the baseball and softball fields, the announcers' voices carrying the names of dreams through the air. The small town airport rests beyond, its engines a distant rumble as planes rise and fall from the earth. Ice cream waits in the heart of town, a sweet reward within reach. The park stands merely eight blocks from our door, a sanctuary for my children and their bikes. This place, in its quiet certainty, is a treasure. A truly fine place to call home.",
            "The place I call home lies on the margins of the city, a stretch of land caught between the whispers of the wild and the orderly hum of suburbia. Here, the hand of the homeowner's association guides all, a silent overseer ensuring that each house stands a mirror to its neighbor. The lawns, neat and trimmed, are but small patches of green, bordered by decorative stones and short driveways that speak of uniformity, of order. Each house guards a two-car garage, and the roadways, freshly laid and smooth, defy the wear of time and tread.\n\nThe homes mostly rise a single story, with the occasional two-story among them, like rare trees in a manicured forest. Gone are the solitary mailboxes that once marked each threshold; now, a cluster of metal boxes stands sentinel at street's end, keys in hand for those who seek their post, parcels tucked away in larger lockers. This, too, is the work of the association, their quest for sameness leaving no stone unturned.\n\nOn these edges where suburb meets the rural, there is space enough for all manner of things. Community pools lie within their gates, pristine and welcoming, while paths wind through the neighborhood, inviting the wanderer or the dog walker to stroll beneath the open sky. There is no need for parks here; the land itself offers room to run, to breathe.\n\nThe people who dwell here are mostly those who've seen the years pass, retirees who keep watch over the quiet streets, their vigilance a comfort to all. Yet among them, a smattering of middle-aged and young professionals find their place, bringing with them the pulse of life's earlier rhythms.\n\nBeyond, the city sprawls, a contradiction of size and intimacy. Its heart beats with the rhythm of a town both large and small, offering the amenities one might seek, though not in abundance. A mall stands modestly, sufficient in its offerings, a mere quarter-hour's drive from the neighborhood's embrace. Once arrived, a world of shops unfolds, from the high-end grocers with their organic fare to the bargain outlets, their shelves sparse and staff few.\n\nIn this place, safety and order reign. The pools and trails are but the surface of its charms, and though the shops lie a drive away, the roads lead ever onward to the chains and stores that promise all one might need. This is the world of my childhood, the shape of home.",
            "The first I knew of that place was from the voice of a stranger on a podcast, a story spun from the mysteries of the missing. The revelation was unexpected. In that quarter, apartments fetched a princely sum each month, a thousand dollars or more. Yet of this tale, neither I nor my kin had ever heard mention. Perhaps it was the struggle that kept it veiled. Nights were soaked in tears for some of my friends, the weight of expense pressing hard. But we had mastered frugality. The scent of bygone relics from the flea market came to be a comfort, the odor of mothballed garments a familiar embrace. In the years of adulthood, you notice less. Perhaps you take to smoking, or merely grow accustomed to the world’s state. Yet the market’s essence permeates all, the dusty tomes piled on a silent piano, clinging to leather long after the wash. \n\nHere, within a stone’s throw, lie three thrift stores. Begin at one edge and you traverse two charity thrifts, a library shadowed by age, a rare book emporium, and a curio shop. Downtown thrums with life, streets choked with the ceaseless flow of cars and people, yet within the thrift stores, silence reigns. A fine refuge for the afternoon’s loss. Each year, the tide of humanity swells, this city in its throes of becoming. They speak of development, the city a nexus for a vast empire of commerce and delivery, still aching with its growth. It conjures the specter of New York, each soul in pursuit of its own end, unburdened by the expectations of others. Solitude is a cherished right, independence a quiet creed, and none will intrude. Unlike the South, where concern is the currency of care, here lives remain unexamined if one wills it. The city rises and recedes like the ocean’s breath upon the shore, a vibrant tapestry. \n\nWithin the confines of my dwelling, life stirs. The pianist’s strains next door, the harmonies of singers above. Here, strangers are kin, a community forged in shared necessity. We gather for life’s markers, its joys and sorrows, lending aid where we can. Fortune has placed me here, among neighbors I cherish, who return my regard. I strive to leave no trace but kindness, sharing the bounty of my kitchen, as they do with me. We exchange letters and parcels, a ritual of connection. Their presence is a solace, and I believe mine is received likewise. In this sprawling mass of concrete and steel, it is these souls who stave off the void, who remind me that my choices have not been in vain.",
            "In the quiet heart of the Midwest, where the fields stretch out like a patchwork quilt, lies a town just beyond the reach of the city’s suburban sprawl. On its eastern fringe sits our neighborhood, perhaps the least prosperous by any measure of wealth. The homes are modest, often rented or owned by those who watch the pennies, their paint peeling beneath the sun's relentless gaze. Yet, it is a place not without its own kind of beauty, a rough-hewn charm that speaks to the soul. The folks here are kind, their greetings warm as the summer sun when you pass them by on the cracked sidewalks. Crime does not haunt us like a specter, though it has whispered its presence here in the form of violence, a shadow that slips through the darkened streets every few years. A neighbor’s boy fell to a gun’s bark outside the neon haze of a bar last year, the echoes of that night still linger, like a mournful wind through the trees. Our family, by some grace, has been spared such direct sorrow save for the odd possession vanished from our porch, forgotten to be brought inside.\n\nThis town of ours, like so many others across the vast expanse of this land, bears the deep scars of an epidemic. The opioid crisis has cut a swath, leaving in its wake those who have succumbed to the siren call of fentanyl. Yet there are those who fight against the tide, places of healing and hope, where the afflicted seek redemption, and others learn to wield Narcan like a shield against despair. \n\nIn the midst of these tribulations, there blooms much that is good. My son’s school, a haven of learning and laughter, stands as a testament to what can be achieved even in trying times. The teachers there, from principal down to the support staff, are pillars of strength and kindness. That he has never been the target of cruelty despite his needs is a blessing, testament to the nurturing soil of that place. The PTO, vibrant and alive, orchestrates moments of joy and learning, drawing families into the fold. Here, where poverty humbles more than a fifth of our people, no child knows the pangs of hunger at school. Meals are given freely, and dignity is preserved amidst the struggle. The city fathers have turned their gaze upon the town's image, paving roads, tending to parks, though their focus leans westward where commerce thrives and the traffic flows. Our side of town remains in waiting, a fact not lost on those of us who call it home.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, this town holds us in its embrace. The people, the schools, the shops that line the streets—they meet our needs. Our home, humble though it may be, is a sanctuary, its worth measured not in dollars but in memories. Sixteen years we have dwelled here, and in all the vastness of the world, there is no other place we would call our own.",
            "The neighborhood sits upon a hill, its streets winding their way between buildings that whisper tales of history to those who listen. It is a place of culture, where the past and present collide in the shadows of the old live theater that stands across from my seven-story apartment building. Down the slope, a humble block away, lies an arcade bar, a haven for souls adrift in the warm breath of summer nights. In the heat of June and July, a line of eager faces stretches along the pavement, waiting for entry, chasing the promise of laughter and light.\n\nAbove, the city park sprawls, an expanse of green in a quarter where space is a luxury. Concrete encircles it like a fortress wall, its surface broken by the jagged teeth of stairs carved into its face. When winter's chill descends, the homeless gather, their tents a patchwork quilt upon the sidewalk and steps, seeking refuge from the rain's relentless assault. It is a hard life, lived in proximity to the family center where warmth and water can be found.\n\nYet, it is not the proud architecture nor the storied structures that capture my heart, but the soul of the people who tread these streets. Hilltop, once a name spoken in fear, echoes with stories of days when the air was thick with the presence of federal agents and the DEA, sweeping through like a cleansing storm. The people remember, and the tales pass from lip to ear, generation to generation, until they reach even newcomers like me. The spirit here is one of resilience, a determination to reclaim and redefine.\n\nThey say the Hill is no place for a white face after dark, a warning born of old fears and misconceptions. But perhaps it is my skin, dark enough to blend, or perhaps the Hilltop recognizes its own in me, one who sees the threads of racism and fear woven into the fabric of our nation. Here, in this so-called cultural utopia, I find a home. The streets pulse with life beneath my feet, each step a testament to the kindness that resides in unexpected places.\n\nWalking these streets at night, I have been met not with malice but with generosity, offered warmth instead of harm. The laundromat owner who keeps the lights on for me, the stranger who presses a crumpled bill into my hand, seeing value where I saw none. These are the moments that bind me to this place, knit me into its story. Hilltop is more than a neighborhood; it is a testament to the enduring spirit of its people, a reminder that home is found in the hearts of those who walk beside you.",
            "I came to this place when the world was just beginning to open its doors to me, the eighth grade looming like a distant horizon. At first, the air was thick with unfamiliarity, the faces all strange and distant. But in time, as it will, the world shifted. I found kinship in the boy two doors down and another lad who called my street home. They've since wandered on, as people do, but their echoes remain etched into the fabric of this place. Most who were here at my coming still tread the same paths, ghosts of their younger selves. The neighborhood, a reflection of the American dream, sprawls with its two-story houses standing sentinel. The weekends bring a symphony of youthful exuberance, the laughter and shouts of children caught in the warmth of the sun. Silence hangs over the weekdays like a shroud. We've all kept our peace here, no quarrels to speak of. Solitude is the norm unless a hand is needed. The parcels I've ordered have always found their way unmolested, a testament to the trust that binds this place. A park lies but a stone's throw from my door, and in it, a tapestry of memories, both bright and shadowed. We've played the games of youth there, my companions and I, until the day the world turned red with pain from an errant elbow. But even that memory fades beneath the weight of joyous days. Now, it is the realm of my cousin's children, their laughter a bridge to my past, their delight in swings and slides a mirror to my own gone days. The park is a vessel of nostalgia, a keeper of time. Here, the world converges in its diversity, each face a story, each dish a journey. Within a mile's reach, flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy whisper their tales. Yet, in these times, many choose the path of least resistance, letting the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash bring the world to their doorsteps. Fast food reigns as king, a staple of suburban life, with pizza places dotting the map like stars. The stores hold all one might need, a Walgreens and CVS standing guard, alongside Jewel-Osco, a familiar name in the Midwest. Even here, the world finds its way in, an Indian shop offering a taste of home or adventure. In all, I find solace in this neighborhood. The tales of woe and strife I hear from afar serve only to deepen my gratitude for the peace I know here.",
            "The neighborhood I call home rests in close proximity to the college, a fact that lends a certain convenience to my days. The landscape is dotted with apartment buildings, their facades worn with time, and among them, a scattering of restaurants and bars that beckon with modest charms and costs. One of these bars, now bearing a new name, demands a heavier toll for its libations, yet its offerings are not the worst one might endure. The people, mostly students and those of lesser means, find their refuge here, the rent not beyond reach. Children roam, their laughter carried on the air from the nearby school, a stone's throw from my abode.\n\nThe faces of my neighbors remain a mystery, a distance I find suitable. Their penchant for smoke has summoned a fragrant retribution from the building's overseers, an air freshener planted like a sentinel at their door, a jest shared in quiet amusement with my companion. These structures, aged in visage, might conceal interiors touched by modern hands. Down the way, new apartments rise, their construction a flimsy artifice betrayed by exorbitant rents, a ruse abetted by their nearness to the campus grounds.\n\nA humble eatery lies but five minutes' walk, its fare served on paper, warmed by the hum of machinery. Across the way, a gas station stands, its reputation as an employer shadowed by whispers. Yet, the city’s coin has brought fresh roads, wide sidewalks, and green upon medians, a veneer of civility. My own dwelling finds itself cloaked in trees, save for stumps where some were felled. Behind lies a line of trees, beyond which another set of apartments stands. I reside on 42nd street, while the next, 43rd, shows the wear of years, its sidewalks crumbling, its buildings cloaked in neglect, the trees a screen against the eyes.\n\nCrime has its haunt on that thoroughfare, though blame does not rest solely there. Across from me, too, the shadows linger, a transient tide flowing through. Still, I find a contentment in this place. It suits my purse and offers what I need. The university, a short walk away, and the buses, ready to carry me to the heart of the city or to the store, make life here more than bearable.",
            "In the elbow of the road where the cul-de-sac bends, the duplexes stand like solitary houses, their yellow skin, white porches, and green metal roofs under the expansive sky. Folks here, almost kin in their quiet camaraderie, gather by the driveways as the sun dips low, the children weaving dreams from chalk and kite string. The air, thick with the scent of the earth and the chatter of neighbors, feels untouched by the clamor of the world beyond. Fields and trees cradle us, the sky a canvas of blue and white.  \n\nYet, this season, the air carries whispers of storms, the threats of tornadoes. Last night, the sirens wailed, their call cutting through the dusk, and I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my littlest dog, a purse, and a few pillows. The big dog stayed out in the living room, his bark echoing the thrum of the hail that pelted the earth. Outside, the world seemed to hold its breath, the storm's aftermath leaving the road steaming, the temperature plummeting from 92 to 75 in a heartbeat. The hail, hot against the pavement, melted swiftly, and as the skies cleared, a double rainbow arched across the horizon. I seized my camera, capturing the marvel to share with distant kin and companions, their awe mirroring my own.\n\nThe streets lay hushed for an hour before life resumed its rhythm, children and mothers emerging as the fragrance of dinners wafted from open windows. For a northerner newly settled in the South, this neighborhood is a balm, the lilt of southern voices a melody to my ears. Each duplex, a mirror of the next, holds its secrets within, rooms of varying dimensions behind identical facades. I often wander to the broad field behind us, tracing the path to the pond where the deer tread softly and the bullfrog's song greets the dawn. Just forty minutes from Charlotte, it feels a world away, roosters heralding the morning from nearby farms. And as night falls, the bray of a donkey from a distant farm reminds us of our place in this patch of earth. This neighborhood is a found treasure, nestled in the heart of the world.",
            "The years have passed in this place and I reckon I’ve come to know it some. At first, I was filled with a kind of sorrow when we left the streets of Riverdale behind. I cried for what was gone, for the kin and the kind I had known there. My folks, they had the notion to find a better life for me and my sister, so we moved on to Stockbridge where the schools and the houses were finer, where the air seemed less filled with the ghosts of the old life. Time carried on and I made new friends there and some enemies too, as one does. The neighbors were mostly strangers to me save for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived close by. They became like family, a comfort I came to value. I remember the day when we all went to Mr. Glen’s wedding, this remarrying of his with Ms. Veda. A day filled with laughter and promise. I caught the garter she tossed, but the flowers eluded me. We danced long into the night and I remember that time with Marsharii, their daughter, though she has since gone her own way. I hope the world has treated her well. The neighborhood is a tangle, a labyrinth of streets and stories, but with a GPS now I’ve explored deeper. My friends Kason and Curtis and I would wander and play, losing ourselves in the games of youth, seeking joy wherever it was to be found. Sometimes I would take to the park, where the quiet of nature would settle in me, a balm for the restless soul. I’d balance on sticks or wield my wooden sword, finding solace in these small pleasures. There are courts for tennis and basketball, though I’ve not played in some time, taught by my father and Mr. Graves who worked us hard but filled those days with laughter. This place has held many a memory, each one etched into the time spent here, and I reckon the finest are yet to come.",
            "The town lay quiet under the South Carolina sun, a small place not unlike others but known far and wide for the peaches that grew in its soil. Johnston, they called it, and the sign as you entered spoke proudly of it being the Peach Capital of the World. Farmlands stretched out on every side, rows of peach trees and cattle grazing in the fields. Houses stood some distance apart, their metal roofs glinting against the summer's heat, or gray shingles weathered and old. They were set back from the road, leaving the land before them open for crops and beasts.\n\nIn the heart of the town hung a solitary stoplight above the four-way, beneath which lay the few stores that served the people. A Chinese place, Hong Kong, run by a family, and Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, where you could get a burger to go. There had been a pizzeria once, but it shut its doors not long ago. A small pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, offered more than medicine, known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sold. \n\nThe grocer, IGA, was the only one in town, but folks often drove to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main shopping. Dollar General was where the people came, a small store bustling from dawn to dusk, shelves laden with the needs of everyday life. A furniture place, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman whose name everyone knew, stood with its doors open, employing two men to deliver what was bought. Next to it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels offered care for the animals, grooming and boarding and such.\n\nThere were small practices for doctoring and veterinary needs, both away from the main street but capable enough for Johnston's needs. Johnston Elementary was the school, and after the fifth grade, the children moved on to the next town for further schooling. There was no park in Johnston, though they talked of making a space for families and visitors, a place of 2.5 acres where life might find some leisure.\n\nThere were no cinemas or alleys for bowling, no place for the young to gather, no playgrounds for the children, nor paths for walking the dogs. The eateries were few and far between. But it was a town of its own, small enough that one might miss it if they didn't slow down to look, passing by with just a blink and it would be gone.",
            "In a small southern town of Tennessee, there’s a stretch of suburbia where I have made my home. The street runs between two state highways, a ribbon of asphalt that carries more traffic than I’d care for, though the neighborhood itself keeps mostly to its own quiet rhythms. Folks here do not come and go with much frequency, and so the faces have become familiar, like the slow turn of seasons. Yard work occupies the hands of the people, and the days pass with the hum of lawnmowers from March to October, a constant chorus beneath the green canopy that shades us. In winter, such as it is, we sled down the hill, though winter has grown thin, more of a long autumn now.\n\nOur house stands at the street’s corner, a sentry watching all who pass, and we know the parade of cars by their daily ritual. A strange vehicle catches our eye, an anomaly in the habitual landscape. The neighbors walk their dogs, children ride their bicycles, and life unspools as one would expect. We dwell here, my wife and I, with our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. Our comings and goings are part of the neighborhood’s fabric, as we work from home, stepping out to play even in the rain’s embrace.\n\nOn occasion, the grill on our back deck sends forth the scent of barbecue, a fragrant signal of time well spent. The trees, remnants of a forest long subdued, offer shade and a bounty of leaves come autumn. The smoke of burning leaves, a perfume of the season’s turning, is a welcome herald of fall’s arrival.\n\nThe garage is my sanctuary at the house’s rear, a place for the truck and small projects. With doors open, I feel the pulse of the street, the heartbeat of the neighborhood. Holidays bring a hush, save for the influx of cars during Thanksgiving or the like, when families gather and the street fills with the presence of those from afar. \n\nHere, in this place, I find contentment. Perfect it is not, for the road draws traffic, yet it is home, and I have come to love it as one loves the flawed and familiar.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where the earth swells in barren waves of dust and grit, lies my neighborhood. A land of endless brown, the kind that seeps into your bones until even the notion of green feels foreign. If one were to stumble upon a patch of lawn, it stands not as a testament to nature but to the wallet of its keeper. When I first set roots here back in the nineties, the houses were scattered like lone sentinels across the desolate expanse. Time has drawn them closer, though the land still stretches wide with new growth creeping in like tendrils of some slow, creeping vine. This place takes on the guise of a city, yet it remains caught between worlds, shifting and changing as all places do with the passage of years.\n\nThe folks here, they're good people mostly, though like in any cluster of humanity, you've your saints and your sinners. My corner of the world, it's a haven of kindly elders, a quieter enclave amidst the expanse. Chain stores dot the landscape, names familiar to all—Food For Less, Smart and Final. For something finer, a journey is required, as stores like Whole Foods are but whispers on the wind here. Construction is the lifeblood of this city, not that numbers would tell you, but the wide-open spaces lay ready for the hammer and nail. It unsettles me some, this constant build and change. I fled the sprawl of a great city once and have no mind to return. My trade is among these builders; I ply my hands in drywall and T-bar, a craftsman shaping the bones of new abodes.\n\nThe desert's stark beauty draws many, a vast tapestry of rugged life where creatures eke out an existence in the harsh embrace of the land. We who dwell here have learned the ways of our fellow denizens: lizards and insects that scuttle across the sands. My three children, wild with the wonder of youth, spend their days in pursuit of these desert denizens, gathering them like treasures in the palms of their hands.\n\nThis place has its lures, and for those who seek them, they are here to be found. Victorville stands as a gateway to a different kind of existence. Each year, the San Bernardino County Fair breathes life into the desert, a carnival of laughter and light. And should you wander further, Wrightwood awaits with its snow-capped peaks, offering the promise of winter's chill and the thrill of sport. For those with a mind to learn of the land's history, the Victor Valley Museum holds tales of stone and bone, of those who walked here long before the world was as it is now.\n\nIn this place of dust and dreams, we carve out our days, each one a thread in the tapestry of this desert life.",
            "In the telling of my neighborhood, there is a strangeness to the tale that might not find its echo in the stories of others. Where others might speak of streets lined with houses and lives lived behind closed doors, mine is the tale of a campus that sprawls like a quiet testament to learning, and of a dormitory that whispers its secrets in the hush of night. This is my neighborhood, with its peculiar rhythms and its own quiet cadences. \n\nThis place, this campus, is a constellation of houses. There are the apartments, each a small world unto itself, holding within its walls two to four souls, lives interwoven, and stories shared. Each building rises but two floors, twenty lives suspended therein, like stars in a firmament. Then there are the houses, scattered and few, standing like sentinels in the landscape, offering shelter to those with ties to the school, alumni who linger in the embrace of their old haunt. And then, the dormitories, vast and cavernous, where hundreds of students find their rest, two to a room, sometimes more, the hum of their lives a quiet symphony in the night.\n\nThe people here are a tapestry of color and culture, each thread a unique hue, weaving a narrative that is rich and varied. They come from places far and wide, the professional staff finding their refuge in the scattered houses, the new students in the dormitories, and the older ones in apartments, each finding their place in this communal dance.\n\nThe heart of this neighborhood beats with the rhythm of its stores and its solitary park. The shops offer a bounty of choices, dining options that speak of the world beyond these walls, and the school's own peculiar offerings of clothing and sustenance. It is a place where the needs of life can be met without ever leaving its bounds. And the park, a green sanctuary in the midst of it all, a playground for the diverse souls who call this place home, kept clean and safe by the unseen hands of its community.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, a place woven from the threads of lives lived in proximity and purpose, a world unto itself.",
            "There were no sidewalks to speak of where I lived. Everything leaned toward the earth's pull, and our house stood at the peak of the steepest hill known around these parts. Folks called it the \"workout hill\" on account of the joggers who made a ritual of its ascent. With no sidewalks, the road became the path for all, pocked and treacherous underfoot or wheel. Telephone wires slung across the block sagged like old clotheslines, patched and piecemeal from the storms that raged and tore at them with impunity. The rain came often, smothering the land with its gray shroud. Tall evergreens rose sentinel-like, their presence despised for the way they blocked the ocean's view. Thus the houses climbed the hill, glass faces turned seaward, vying for the bay's embrace. At sunset, the water glowed as if lit from beneath, the sky a canvas of orange fire, though more often than not the clouds stifled the light, leaving behind a world dim and muted. In such a place, moss claimed dominion, creeping over roofs, cars, railings, until all bore its green mantle. I left my car to the elements once, and when I returned, it was a moss-cloaked monolith, demanding hours of labor to free it from nature's grip.\n\nChildren were scarce, though a school lay just a few blocks distant. The neighborhood was a bastion for the aged, those who had set aside the burdens of work. In place of children, there were dogs, a legion of them, roaming lawns and racing down streets, slipping through open doors like shadows. One found its way into my home, and I had to chase it out as one might a wayward spirit. Rabbits too ran wild, digging and burrowing, to the gardeners' despair, but my cats hunted them with a fervor born of ancient instincts. Birds flitted about, the small and the swift, with the occasional hawk or eagle passing by, only to be harried by crows until they vanished. Stores were absent, but a descent to the waterfront revealed eateries offering the sea's bounty. The shore was not one of sand but of stone, where rocks begged to be cast into the bay's embrace. The bay itself was a narrow expanse, the far shore visible even through the mist's persistent veil.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, a place you won’t find hard to reach. Public transport runs like a lifeline through the city, a pulse in the arteries of New York, and there you'll find yourself still steeped in the urban sprawl. Walk these streets and see the Asian markets sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. Two decades have drawn them here, their presence felt in every block, every corner. Supermarkets and laundromats dominion. The locals, they favor them for the food is rich and the prices kinder and the convenience a godsend. Four Asian supermarkets lie just a stone's throw from where I stand, clustered together like kinfolk. Convenience, they call it, this nearness of grocery within arm's reach.\n\nStill, Bensonhurst is not all Asian faces. A mosaic, this place, of immigrants and their children, first and second generations finding their place under the sun. The great businesses, the ones that draw the eye, are theirs. And close by, a park remade anew, with ten courts for basketball, a broad field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings and a playground for the young ones. A fountain too, where children laugh and splash away summer's heat. Parks, like the city, are a tapestry of faces and colors, woven together in play.\n\nThe skyline here is low, no towering corporate monoliths. Co-ops and condos rise up, but mostly homes built for two families, neighbors close enough to hear the hum of life. The people, they are kind enough but noisy. Cars drive by with music loud enough to rattle windows and engines revving like a call to arms, waking you with the morning light.\n\nNight brings its own counsel. The streets are mostly safe, but dark corners breed uncertainty. You might encounter those with mischief in their eyes, bullies and thieves who take what isn’t theirs. I’ve felt their fists before, long ago, and more recent still are the hands that steal packages from steps. And then there are the dogs and their masters who care not for the law. Fines do nothing to mend what is broken in them. A morning walk is a dance around the waste they leave, a nuisance that grates upon the soul. Mind your shoes as you make your way.",
            "The first thing to reckon with about Portland, Oregon is the notion of what it means to be \"weird\". A mural scrawled across a building's backside, housing a pizza joint and a bar and a music hall and a strip club, each flirting with the fringes of legality, declares \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a plea to recall the Portland from the nineties and early aughts, a city less renowned and less dear, a crucible of creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is now a badge of honor. Despite the tide of prosperous Californians and the ceaseless rise of condominiums to harbor them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weird doesn't mean always embracing, but it means a tolerance for the unordinary. Weird doesn't mean we're devoid of modernities nor struggles. Like the rest of the nation, our wares mostly hail from China. There are multitudes of ways to be weird, to be unorthodox, and yet Portland has its fill of the ordinary. It has yoga and hipsters and buttoned-down professionals. Perhaps weird means we hold all these with a looser grip. In my quarter, as in many of Portland's quarters, houses bloom in color, gardens blossom with flowers and herbs and vegetables along the lanes, and in summer, free boxes appear. These free boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items cast away by their owners but waiting to be claimed by passersby. They hold a magic, a serendipity, offering treasures perfect for the one who happens upon them. Clothes and books are common finds, though the contents can be anything. The enchantment of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of what Portland means to me, though I am but one shade of weird among countless others. Some among us would never dream of clothing themselves from a box on the curb. Those folk attend goat yoga—yes, yoga amidst goats—or cheer at the Timbers' soccer matches. Portland abounds with folk devoted to all manner of pursuits. It abounds with folk chasing dreams, or dreaming of the chase while spending hours at the bar. Indeed, Portland grapples with a drug problem. Such troubles often root in the soil of mental health, and the unending rain, the somber clouds, surely have a hand in it. Homelessness haunts us too, an enigma resisted by all. The homeless come drawn by Portland's services, kinder than most, though still wanting, as they are everywhere. The housed sway between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stood like sentinels, immutable in the north where they bore witness to the sun’s eternal passage. Each dawn, each dusk, they watched as if the great orb's journey were no more than the turning of a wheel. I could forget them in the clamor of days, in the weight of work and the clutches of life, yet still they remained, patient and indifferent to the fleeting troubles of men. On days when the world crowded in and pressed heavy upon me, they called out, and I would turn to them. They offered solace to a weary soul, strength enough to face the coming day. I first came to this place as a youth, drawn by the university and its promise of knowledge. Yet it was the mountains north of the campus that seized my heart. The university boasted its own wonders, with its stately buildings and tranquil ponds and trees that whispered of time and seasons. These too claimed a part of me, but it was the mountains that held sway. The town lay beneath them, beautiful in its own right. Countless cafés became my refuge, where hours of study found fuel in endless cups of coffee. A short walk or bus ride brought one to the heart of downtown, where faded bricks lined streets and spoke of years gone by. Here, the town shed its suburban skin, bustling with the vigor of its urban neighbors, though the clamor ebbed away within a few blocks. Beyond the library, serenity awaited, the town's quiet soul. This juxtaposition of life and stillness lent the city a certain magic, a siren song that promised discovery. In such a place, memories wove themselves into the fabric of the streets. Nights spent with friends beneath the rusted swings in the park, or rushing through the crowd to catch a film at the theater, a gift from the university. Yet the city held its share of sorrow, as all places must. The ponds, their surfaces mirrored the sky, a fitting stage for reflection or midnight tears. In the midst of an existential dread, I found myself there often. Watching the turtles and ducks and insects, each carrying out its simple purpose, I questioned my own. I wandered past the pond, through the park, past neat little houses that spoke of suburban life, until the main street opened before me. The sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I looked up, I saw the north stretched before me. There they were, as they had always been. The mountains, steadfast and eternal, brushed against the blue and yellow heavens, towering over all. In their silent majesty, they stirred within me a sense of resolve, a whisper of endurance that would not be silenced.",
            "You might pass it by without a second look. A place that doesn't catch the eye, hidden in the folds of a quiet town, tucked behind the tired facades of a shopping strip. The kind of place that seems unlikely for living, where folks wouldn't choose to settle. And yet, beyond the husk of an old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty but for the once-a-year gatherings of kin in summer's warm embrace, lies a community alive and unsung. Streets lined with apartments, each complex a part of a larger whole, like Russian dolls that have been meticulously laid out side by side, their secrets whispered to those who know where to listen. The first set of apartments has seen its share of scandal, tales told in hushed voices, tales that paint a picture darker than the truth. But beyond, a different world breathes, unknown to the many who dwell in these parts. Across from these sentinels of life stands the quiet campus of a community college, its buildings watching over the road. Students shuffle in with steaming cups as day breaks, their eyes heavy with the promise of knowledge, while the iron gates groan in welcome. Commuters scowl from their cars, impatient with the slow procession of those seeking enlightenment. The road splits then, one path leading to a park where laughter echoes, and the other to a place of healing, where broken bodies mend. The center speaks of comfort, with its inviting porches and whispering fans that stir the heavy air. Children race across the park, their limbs a blur of joy among the tall grass, bees dancing lazily in the blossoms. Elderly folks walk their dogs, casting disapproving glances at the youth who skate with abandon, while clusters of girls share secrets by the swings. Nearby, a strip mall offers its own quiet tales. A sushi joint with fare that's good but seldom sought, a shop selling summer's promise in swimming gear, and a salon where nails find their gloss. Here, one could linger, juggling life's small pleasures—a pool's cool embrace, a touch of polish, a plate of hibachi. Even a place to find frozen delight, sweet and cold in the hands of teens who ride the edge of recklessness under the southern sun. This neighborhood, a small reflection of the nation's heart, a snapshot of the enduring South where time slips by like the gentle flow of a river, unchanged and unchanging.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawling under the wide and open sky, the houses lined up like quiet sentinels of a bygone dream. Most were homes for single families, yet some had been cleaved in two, standing side by side as if unsure of their own symmetry. My own stood with its small yard and its slender driveway, a relic of an era when the suburbs whispered promises of the American dream. Once, this dream embraced the land and its people, but now it drifts like smoke. Still, the neighborhood endures, its voice a distant echo of hope, speaking to those who wander its streets that the dream holds on by a thread.\n\nThe folks here, their optimism has faded like the paint on the picket fences, the yards not tended as they once were. Yet cars remain parked in driveways, and the children play in the streets as if the world they knew was the only world that mattered. The old schoolhouse, nearly ninety years in its standing, breathes life into the young and churns up memories for the old. Churches are sparse, mostly hollowed out, yet the courts are alive with the sound of leather against pavement.\n\nEach home wears a different face, yet they share a common soul. There is the supermarket called Super \"A,\" its aisles watched over by a Yemeni family, perhaps the sole Arab presence in these parts. Most here are African American, their roots deep in the earth of this place. The streets are wide, and the children's games pause only for the passing of cars. Many families have been here for generations, their stories woven into the fabric of the past where all knew each other by name.\n\nThere was a karate school once, but Hollywood turned away from such dreams, and now it is a pharmacy, for some say pills soothe where dreams cannot. A small theater still stands, offering old films at a price that draws the elders but leaves the young unmoved. An expressway cuts through the town, its exits beyond our borders. Once, there was a clamor for an exit here, the young in favor, the old against. They said it would spoil the town, and in the end, the city council listened to their quiet wisdom.\n\nThey're raising a new high school now, and we ponder a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin might just capture the heart of this place.",
            "The city sprawls in its vastness, a tapestry of lives interwoven yet distinct. Here, where the streets wind erratically among towers of commerce, life unfolds in a patchwork of humanity. Offices stand in rows like sentinels, their windows darkened by the shadows of monoliths. Shops and eateries abound, each a world unto itself, drawing wanderers in with the promise of sustenance or some fleeting escape. Grand emporiums of renown mark the landscape, countered by humble boutiques that cling to the city's cobbled arteries. The avenues, lined with these varied establishments, pulse with the footfalls of those who dwell within neighborhoods meant for quietude yet touched by the ever-present hum of urban life.\n\nParks, mere patches of green amidst the concrete sea, offer respite to those seeking solace beneath their boughs. Children play, their laughter echoing the innocence of days unspoiled. In this place, diversity is not a claim but a living truth. The streets tell tales of those who came from lands afar—their languages a symphony, their customs a tapestry. Here, the LGBTQ+ community finds its voice alongside the devout chants of the Orthodox, and the stories of those who fled the shadow of the Soviet Union unfold with each step taken.\n\nBeyond these streets, the city stretches further, a mosaic of enclaves each with its own identity. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—names that speak of heritage and belonging, yet the journey to each is fraught with the trials of traffic that binds the city in its relentless grip. Miles pass slowly beneath the wheels, the hours marked by the stagnant crawl of vehicles in endless procession. The irony of a city so vast is its constriction, for though the distances may be short, the passage is long and wearying.\n\nYet, they come still. The cranes rise, and new towers reach for the heavens as if the earth itself might yield more space. The city draws them in, but not without dissent. For with each new soul, the roads grow fuller, the spaces tighter. Those who have called this place home watch the change with wary eyes.\n\nIn this labyrinth, homes take many forms. Towers of glass and steel stand alongside modest dwellings, each a sanctuary for its inhabitants. Some find solace in the singular embrace of family homes, while others share walls in duplexes. The streets of my own neighborhood, a microcosm of the city itself, reveal a myriad of domiciles, each sheltering lives as varied as the cityscape. Yet, in this place of infinite variety, familiarity is a rare currency. The faces of neighbors slip by like shadows, unknown and unknowing, save for the echoes of childhood laughter that linger in the memory of games once played in the fading light of simpler days.",
            "The road stretched out through the fields of corn, endless and vast, where the horizon seemed to hold the very sky. She peered out, eyes wide, the silence of the land standing in stark contrast to the world she knew, where the grocery store was a mere stroll from her door. But here, there was only the earth, boundless and unbroken, and I told her of my Ohio, of my youth in a place where land was the measure of a man. Down the narrow road, past the quarry brimming with water that mirrored the heavens, lay the small gathering of homes where I lived. Each house, a fortress of brick and stucco, staked its claim on the earth, a half-acre of pride in every yard. In spring, the gardens burst forth, a riot of flowers beneath the weathered limbs of trees that marked the seasons with their changing hues.\n\nThe driveways shimmered with the polish of fine Mercedes, a gleam in the sun that spoke of care and labor. As I neared my gray stucco home, there was my neighbor, the Korean, always with a song on his lips and the mower's drone beneath his voice. He was a man whose years had taken some of his sharpness, yet his heart was ever true. Once a healer, now he tended his grass as diligently as he once did his patients, becoming one with the earth and his John Deere.\n\nWhen you arrive at my home, the geese are there, bold amid the grass, and our Terrier, ever the hunter, gives chase. Beyond, a stream weaves through the land, a quiet melody against the distant calls of cows. Across the bridge of wood, crafted by hand, lies a sanctuary untouched by time, where trees and wildflowers grow as they will. Here was the cradle of my childhood, a realm of forts and pursuits, where imagination ran as wild as the creatures we chased.\n\nWinter came with its own harsh beauty, casting the land in white, the living world turned to stillness. The trees stood bare, sentinels in a frozen expanse, yet when snow graced the ground, it became a canvas for angels and snowmen, the work of my sister's hands. We were warriors in those days, snowballs our weapons, forts of snow and branch our bastions. There, in our winter kingdom, we found the freedom of children, untouched by the world beyond."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, where the land stretches out in vast tapestries, lies the small town of Michigan. A place where fields yield to quaint tourist hamlets, and the notion of sprawling city malls and chains like Wal-Mart or Target remains a distant echo. Here, every journey demands the road. And yet, this is among the world's most beautiful places, flanked by waters on all sides. The town itself, cradled between the mighty Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. A place where the shoreline is never far, and the sands invite the weary to wade in.\n\nOur neighborhood speaks the language of small-town America. Homes stand apart, not pressed together like the crowded bricks of a cityscape. These are no uniform dwellings; each bears its own story. Some are old, having seen the years pass, while others wear the newness of renovation. Basements, full and visible from the street, anchor these houses, many clad in the armor of aged aluminum siding. All colors of the spectrum paint the blocks around my home, a patchwork quilt of humanity. Each house with its own little realm, yards adorned with trampolines and swing sets. Gardens bloom, fences contain the creatures that share our lives. Middle America, they call it. A place of earnest folk, toiling through the days, nurturing families or watching them grow.\n\nOn any day, children race along the streets, laughter echoing between the homes. Dogs with eager tails lead their humans on walks, bicycles roll, and rollerblades whisper over the pavement. Neighbors know each other here, woven into the fabric of community. A wave from the grill, a nod from the dog walker a few blocks down. The lawns are kept, leaves of autumn are not left to languish. Grass, green and tamed, bushes and plants trimmed and tidy. This is not a neighborhood of grandeur, but one of warmth. A place where families find solace, where the quiet and the calm weave a tapestry of safety. The kind of place where you feel the world has provided a haven at the end of the day.\n\nA short walk finds the county sheriff’s department and jail, a sentinel of order. The health department stands beside it, a bastion of care. Down the road, the city recycling center hums with purpose, serving the people diligently. Nearby, the crack of bat against ball rings out from the baseball and softball fields, the announcers' voices carrying the names of dreams through the air. The small town airport rests beyond, its engines a distant rumble as planes rise and fall from the earth. Ice cream waits in the heart of town, a sweet reward within reach. The park stands merely eight blocks from our door, a sanctuary for my children and their bikes. This place, in its quiet certainty, is a treasure. A truly fine place to call home.",
            "The place I call home lies on the margins of the city, a stretch of land caught between the whispers of the wild and the orderly hum of suburbia. Here, the hand of the homeowner's association guides all, a silent overseer ensuring that each house stands a mirror to its neighbor. The lawns, neat and trimmed, are but small patches of green, bordered by decorative stones and short driveways that speak of uniformity, of order. Each house guards a two-car garage, and the roadways, freshly laid and smooth, defy the wear of time and tread.\n\nThe homes mostly rise a single story, with the occasional two-story among them, like rare trees in a manicured forest. Gone are the solitary mailboxes that once marked each threshold; now, a cluster of metal boxes stands sentinel at street's end, keys in hand for those who seek their post, parcels tucked away in larger lockers. This, too, is the work of the association, their quest for sameness leaving no stone unturned.\n\nOn these edges where suburb meets the rural, there is space enough for all manner of things. Community pools lie within their gates, pristine and welcoming, while paths wind through the neighborhood, inviting the wanderer or the dog walker to stroll beneath the open sky. There is no need for parks here; the land itself offers room to run, to breathe.\n\nThe people who dwell here are mostly those who've seen the years pass, retirees who keep watch over the quiet streets, their vigilance a comfort to all. Yet among them, a smattering of middle-aged and young professionals find their place, bringing with them the pulse of life's earlier rhythms.\n\nBeyond, the city sprawls, a contradiction of size and intimacy. Its heart beats with the rhythm of a town both large and small, offering the amenities one might seek, though not in abundance. A mall stands modestly, sufficient in its offerings, a mere quarter-hour's drive from the neighborhood's embrace. Once arrived, a world of shops unfolds, from the high-end grocers with their organic fare to the bargain outlets, their shelves sparse and staff few.\n\nIn this place, safety and order reign. The pools and trails are but the surface of its charms, and though the shops lie a drive away, the roads lead ever onward to the chains and stores that promise all one might need. This is the world of my childhood, the shape of home.",
            "The first I knew of that place was from the voice of a stranger on a podcast, a story spun from the mysteries of the missing. The revelation was unexpected. In that quarter, apartments fetched a princely sum each month, a thousand dollars or more. Yet of this tale, neither I nor my kin had ever heard mention. Perhaps it was the struggle that kept it veiled. Nights were soaked in tears for some of my friends, the weight of expense pressing hard. But we had mastered frugality. The scent of bygone relics from the flea market came to be a comfort, the odor of mothballed garments a familiar embrace. In the years of adulthood, you notice less. Perhaps you take to smoking, or merely grow accustomed to the world’s state. Yet the market’s essence permeates all, the dusty tomes piled on a silent piano, clinging to leather long after the wash. \n\nHere, within a stone’s throw, lie three thrift stores. Begin at one edge and you traverse two charity thrifts, a library shadowed by age, a rare book emporium, and a curio shop. Downtown thrums with life, streets choked with the ceaseless flow of cars and people, yet within the thrift stores, silence reigns. A fine refuge for the afternoon’s loss. Each year, the tide of humanity swells, this city in its throes of becoming. They speak of development, the city a nexus for a vast empire of commerce and delivery, still aching with its growth. It conjures the specter of New York, each soul in pursuit of its own end, unburdened by the expectations of others. Solitude is a cherished right, independence a quiet creed, and none will intrude. Unlike the South, where concern is the currency of care, here lives remain unexamined if one wills it. The city rises and recedes like the ocean’s breath upon the shore, a vibrant tapestry. \n\nWithin the confines of my dwelling, life stirs. The pianist’s strains next door, the harmonies of singers above. Here, strangers are kin, a community forged in shared necessity. We gather for life’s markers, its joys and sorrows, lending aid where we can. Fortune has placed me here, among neighbors I cherish, who return my regard. I strive to leave no trace but kindness, sharing the bounty of my kitchen, as they do with me. We exchange letters and parcels, a ritual of connection. Their presence is a solace, and I believe mine is received likewise. In this sprawling mass of concrete and steel, it is these souls who stave off the void, who remind me that my choices have not been in vain.",
            "In the quiet heart of the Midwest, where the fields stretch out like a patchwork quilt, lies a town just beyond the reach of the city’s suburban sprawl. On its eastern fringe sits our neighborhood, perhaps the least prosperous by any measure of wealth. The homes are modest, often rented or owned by those who watch the pennies, their paint peeling beneath the sun's relentless gaze. Yet, it is a place not without its own kind of beauty, a rough-hewn charm that speaks to the soul. The folks here are kind, their greetings warm as the summer sun when you pass them by on the cracked sidewalks. Crime does not haunt us like a specter, though it has whispered its presence here in the form of violence, a shadow that slips through the darkened streets every few years. A neighbor’s boy fell to a gun’s bark outside the neon haze of a bar last year, the echoes of that night still linger, like a mournful wind through the trees. Our family, by some grace, has been spared such direct sorrow save for the odd possession vanished from our porch, forgotten to be brought inside.\n\nThis town of ours, like so many others across the vast expanse of this land, bears the deep scars of an epidemic. The opioid crisis has cut a swath, leaving in its wake those who have succumbed to the siren call of fentanyl. Yet there are those who fight against the tide, places of healing and hope, where the afflicted seek redemption, and others learn to wield Narcan like a shield against despair. \n\nIn the midst of these tribulations, there blooms much that is good. My son’s school, a haven of learning and laughter, stands as a testament to what can be achieved even in trying times. The teachers there, from principal down to the support staff, are pillars of strength and kindness. That he has never been the target of cruelty despite his needs is a blessing, testament to the nurturing soil of that place. The PTO, vibrant and alive, orchestrates moments of joy and learning, drawing families into the fold. Here, where poverty humbles more than a fifth of our people, no child knows the pangs of hunger at school. Meals are given freely, and dignity is preserved amidst the struggle. The city fathers have turned their gaze upon the town's image, paving roads, tending to parks, though their focus leans westward where commerce thrives and the traffic flows. Our side of town remains in waiting, a fact not lost on those of us who call it home.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, this town holds us in its embrace. The people, the schools, the shops that line the streets—they meet our needs. Our home, humble though it may be, is a sanctuary, its worth measured not in dollars but in memories. Sixteen years we have dwelled here, and in all the vastness of the world, there is no other place we would call our own.",
            "The neighborhood sits upon a hill, its streets winding their way between buildings that whisper tales of history to those who listen. It is a place of culture, where the past and present collide in the shadows of the old live theater that stands across from my seven-story apartment building. Down the slope, a humble block away, lies an arcade bar, a haven for souls adrift in the warm breath of summer nights. In the heat of June and July, a line of eager faces stretches along the pavement, waiting for entry, chasing the promise of laughter and light.\n\nAbove, the city park sprawls, an expanse of green in a quarter where space is a luxury. Concrete encircles it like a fortress wall, its surface broken by the jagged teeth of stairs carved into its face. When winter's chill descends, the homeless gather, their tents a patchwork quilt upon the sidewalk and steps, seeking refuge from the rain's relentless assault. It is a hard life, lived in proximity to the family center where warmth and water can be found.\n\nYet, it is not the proud architecture nor the storied structures that capture my heart, but the soul of the people who tread these streets. Hilltop, once a name spoken in fear, echoes with stories of days when the air was thick with the presence of federal agents and the DEA, sweeping through like a cleansing storm. The people remember, and the tales pass from lip to ear, generation to generation, until they reach even newcomers like me. The spirit here is one of resilience, a determination to reclaim and redefine.\n\nThey say the Hill is no place for a white face after dark, a warning born of old fears and misconceptions. But perhaps it is my skin, dark enough to blend, or perhaps the Hilltop recognizes its own in me, one who sees the threads of racism and fear woven into the fabric of our nation. Here, in this so-called cultural utopia, I find a home. The streets pulse with life beneath my feet, each step a testament to the kindness that resides in unexpected places.\n\nWalking these streets at night, I have been met not with malice but with generosity, offered warmth instead of harm. The laundromat owner who keeps the lights on for me, the stranger who presses a crumpled bill into my hand, seeing value where I saw none. These are the moments that bind me to this place, knit me into its story. Hilltop is more than a neighborhood; it is a testament to the enduring spirit of its people, a reminder that home is found in the hearts of those who walk beside you.",
            "I came to this place when the world was just beginning to open its doors to me, the eighth grade looming like a distant horizon. At first, the air was thick with unfamiliarity, the faces all strange and distant. But in time, as it will, the world shifted. I found kinship in the boy two doors down and another lad who called my street home. They've since wandered on, as people do, but their echoes remain etched into the fabric of this place. Most who were here at my coming still tread the same paths, ghosts of their younger selves. The neighborhood, a reflection of the American dream, sprawls with its two-story houses standing sentinel. The weekends bring a symphony of youthful exuberance, the laughter and shouts of children caught in the warmth of the sun. Silence hangs over the weekdays like a shroud. We've all kept our peace here, no quarrels to speak of. Solitude is the norm unless a hand is needed. The parcels I've ordered have always found their way unmolested, a testament to the trust that binds this place. A park lies but a stone's throw from my door, and in it, a tapestry of memories, both bright and shadowed. We've played the games of youth there, my companions and I, until the day the world turned red with pain from an errant elbow. But even that memory fades beneath the weight of joyous days. Now, it is the realm of my cousin's children, their laughter a bridge to my past, their delight in swings and slides a mirror to my own gone days. The park is a vessel of nostalgia, a keeper of time. Here, the world converges in its diversity, each face a story, each dish a journey. Within a mile's reach, flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy whisper their tales. Yet, in these times, many choose the path of least resistance, letting the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash bring the world to their doorsteps. Fast food reigns as king, a staple of suburban life, with pizza places dotting the map like stars. The stores hold all one might need, a Walgreens and CVS standing guard, alongside Jewel-Osco, a familiar name in the Midwest. Even here, the world finds its way in, an Indian shop offering a taste of home or adventure. In all, I find solace in this neighborhood. The tales of woe and strife I hear from afar serve only to deepen my gratitude for the peace I know here.",
            "The neighborhood I call home rests in close proximity to the college, a fact that lends a certain convenience to my days. The landscape is dotted with apartment buildings, their facades worn with time, and among them, a scattering of restaurants and bars that beckon with modest charms and costs. One of these bars, now bearing a new name, demands a heavier toll for its libations, yet its offerings are not the worst one might endure. The people, mostly students and those of lesser means, find their refuge here, the rent not beyond reach. Children roam, their laughter carried on the air from the nearby school, a stone's throw from my abode.\n\nThe faces of my neighbors remain a mystery, a distance I find suitable. Their penchant for smoke has summoned a fragrant retribution from the building's overseers, an air freshener planted like a sentinel at their door, a jest shared in quiet amusement with my companion. These structures, aged in visage, might conceal interiors touched by modern hands. Down the way, new apartments rise, their construction a flimsy artifice betrayed by exorbitant rents, a ruse abetted by their nearness to the campus grounds.\n\nA humble eatery lies but five minutes' walk, its fare served on paper, warmed by the hum of machinery. Across the way, a gas station stands, its reputation as an employer shadowed by whispers. Yet, the city’s coin has brought fresh roads, wide sidewalks, and green upon medians, a veneer of civility. My own dwelling finds itself cloaked in trees, save for stumps where some were felled. Behind lies a line of trees, beyond which another set of apartments stands. I reside on 42nd street, while the next, 43rd, shows the wear of years, its sidewalks crumbling, its buildings cloaked in neglect, the trees a screen against the eyes.\n\nCrime has its haunt on that thoroughfare, though blame does not rest solely there. Across from me, too, the shadows linger, a transient tide flowing through. Still, I find a contentment in this place. It suits my purse and offers what I need. The university, a short walk away, and the buses, ready to carry me to the heart of the city or to the store, make life here more than bearable.",
            "In the elbow of the road where the cul-de-sac bends, the duplexes stand like solitary houses, their yellow skin, white porches, and green metal roofs under the expansive sky. Folks here, almost kin in their quiet camaraderie, gather by the driveways as the sun dips low, the children weaving dreams from chalk and kite string. The air, thick with the scent of the earth and the chatter of neighbors, feels untouched by the clamor of the world beyond. Fields and trees cradle us, the sky a canvas of blue and white.  \n\nYet, this season, the air carries whispers of storms, the threats of tornadoes. Last night, the sirens wailed, their call cutting through the dusk, and I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my littlest dog, a purse, and a few pillows. The big dog stayed out in the living room, his bark echoing the thrum of the hail that pelted the earth. Outside, the world seemed to hold its breath, the storm's aftermath leaving the road steaming, the temperature plummeting from 92 to 75 in a heartbeat. The hail, hot against the pavement, melted swiftly, and as the skies cleared, a double rainbow arched across the horizon. I seized my camera, capturing the marvel to share with distant kin and companions, their awe mirroring my own.\n\nThe streets lay hushed for an hour before life resumed its rhythm, children and mothers emerging as the fragrance of dinners wafted from open windows. For a northerner newly settled in the South, this neighborhood is a balm, the lilt of southern voices a melody to my ears. Each duplex, a mirror of the next, holds its secrets within, rooms of varying dimensions behind identical facades. I often wander to the broad field behind us, tracing the path to the pond where the deer tread softly and the bullfrog's song greets the dawn. Just forty minutes from Charlotte, it feels a world away, roosters heralding the morning from nearby farms. And as night falls, the bray of a donkey from a distant farm reminds us of our place in this patch of earth. This neighborhood is a found treasure, nestled in the heart of the world.",
            "The years have passed in this place and I reckon I’ve come to know it some. At first, I was filled with a kind of sorrow when we left the streets of Riverdale behind. I cried for what was gone, for the kin and the kind I had known there. My folks, they had the notion to find a better life for me and my sister, so we moved on to Stockbridge where the schools and the houses were finer, where the air seemed less filled with the ghosts of the old life. Time carried on and I made new friends there and some enemies too, as one does. The neighbors were mostly strangers to me save for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived close by. They became like family, a comfort I came to value. I remember the day when we all went to Mr. Glen’s wedding, this remarrying of his with Ms. Veda. A day filled with laughter and promise. I caught the garter she tossed, but the flowers eluded me. We danced long into the night and I remember that time with Marsharii, their daughter, though she has since gone her own way. I hope the world has treated her well. The neighborhood is a tangle, a labyrinth of streets and stories, but with a GPS now I’ve explored deeper. My friends Kason and Curtis and I would wander and play, losing ourselves in the games of youth, seeking joy wherever it was to be found. Sometimes I would take to the park, where the quiet of nature would settle in me, a balm for the restless soul. I’d balance on sticks or wield my wooden sword, finding solace in these small pleasures. There are courts for tennis and basketball, though I’ve not played in some time, taught by my father and Mr. Graves who worked us hard but filled those days with laughter. This place has held many a memory, each one etched into the time spent here, and I reckon the finest are yet to come.",
            "The town lay quiet under the South Carolina sun, a small place not unlike others but known far and wide for the peaches that grew in its soil. Johnston, they called it, and the sign as you entered spoke proudly of it being the Peach Capital of the World. Farmlands stretched out on every side, rows of peach trees and cattle grazing in the fields. Houses stood some distance apart, their metal roofs glinting against the summer's heat, or gray shingles weathered and old. They were set back from the road, leaving the land before them open for crops and beasts.\n\nIn the heart of the town hung a solitary stoplight above the four-way, beneath which lay the few stores that served the people. A Chinese place, Hong Kong, run by a family, and Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, where you could get a burger to go. There had been a pizzeria once, but it shut its doors not long ago. A small pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, offered more than medicine, known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sold. \n\nThe grocer, IGA, was the only one in town, but folks often drove to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main shopping. Dollar General was where the people came, a small store bustling from dawn to dusk, shelves laden with the needs of everyday life. A furniture place, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman whose name everyone knew, stood with its doors open, employing two men to deliver what was bought. Next to it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels offered care for the animals, grooming and boarding and such.\n\nThere were small practices for doctoring and veterinary needs, both away from the main street but capable enough for Johnston's needs. Johnston Elementary was the school, and after the fifth grade, the children moved on to the next town for further schooling. There was no park in Johnston, though they talked of making a space for families and visitors, a place of 2.5 acres where life might find some leisure.\n\nThere were no cinemas or alleys for bowling, no place for the young to gather, no playgrounds for the children, nor paths for walking the dogs. The eateries were few and far between. But it was a town of its own, small enough that one might miss it if they didn't slow down to look, passing by with just a blink and it would be gone.",
            "In a small southern town of Tennessee, there’s a stretch of suburbia where I have made my home. The street runs between two state highways, a ribbon of asphalt that carries more traffic than I’d care for, though the neighborhood itself keeps mostly to its own quiet rhythms. Folks here do not come and go with much frequency, and so the faces have become familiar, like the slow turn of seasons. Yard work occupies the hands of the people, and the days pass with the hum of lawnmowers from March to October, a constant chorus beneath the green canopy that shades us. In winter, such as it is, we sled down the hill, though winter has grown thin, more of a long autumn now.\n\nOur house stands at the street’s corner, a sentry watching all who pass, and we know the parade of cars by their daily ritual. A strange vehicle catches our eye, an anomaly in the habitual landscape. The neighbors walk their dogs, children ride their bicycles, and life unspools as one would expect. We dwell here, my wife and I, with our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. Our comings and goings are part of the neighborhood’s fabric, as we work from home, stepping out to play even in the rain’s embrace.\n\nOn occasion, the grill on our back deck sends forth the scent of barbecue, a fragrant signal of time well spent. The trees, remnants of a forest long subdued, offer shade and a bounty of leaves come autumn. The smoke of burning leaves, a perfume of the season’s turning, is a welcome herald of fall’s arrival.\n\nThe garage is my sanctuary at the house’s rear, a place for the truck and small projects. With doors open, I feel the pulse of the street, the heartbeat of the neighborhood. Holidays bring a hush, save for the influx of cars during Thanksgiving or the like, when families gather and the street fills with the presence of those from afar. \n\nHere, in this place, I find contentment. Perfect it is not, for the road draws traffic, yet it is home, and I have come to love it as one loves the flawed and familiar.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where the earth swells in barren waves of dust and grit, lies my neighborhood. A land of endless brown, the kind that seeps into your bones until even the notion of green feels foreign. If one were to stumble upon a patch of lawn, it stands not as a testament to nature but to the wallet of its keeper. When I first set roots here back in the nineties, the houses were scattered like lone sentinels across the desolate expanse. Time has drawn them closer, though the land still stretches wide with new growth creeping in like tendrils of some slow, creeping vine. This place takes on the guise of a city, yet it remains caught between worlds, shifting and changing as all places do with the passage of years.\n\nThe folks here, they're good people mostly, though like in any cluster of humanity, you've your saints and your sinners. My corner of the world, it's a haven of kindly elders, a quieter enclave amidst the expanse. Chain stores dot the landscape, names familiar to all—Food For Less, Smart and Final. For something finer, a journey is required, as stores like Whole Foods are but whispers on the wind here. Construction is the lifeblood of this city, not that numbers would tell you, but the wide-open spaces lay ready for the hammer and nail. It unsettles me some, this constant build and change. I fled the sprawl of a great city once and have no mind to return. My trade is among these builders; I ply my hands in drywall and T-bar, a craftsman shaping the bones of new abodes.\n\nThe desert's stark beauty draws many, a vast tapestry of rugged life where creatures eke out an existence in the harsh embrace of the land. We who dwell here have learned the ways of our fellow denizens: lizards and insects that scuttle across the sands. My three children, wild with the wonder of youth, spend their days in pursuit of these desert denizens, gathering them like treasures in the palms of their hands.\n\nThis place has its lures, and for those who seek them, they are here to be found. Victorville stands as a gateway to a different kind of existence. Each year, the San Bernardino County Fair breathes life into the desert, a carnival of laughter and light. And should you wander further, Wrightwood awaits with its snow-capped peaks, offering the promise of winter's chill and the thrill of sport. For those with a mind to learn of the land's history, the Victor Valley Museum holds tales of stone and bone, of those who walked here long before the world was as it is now.\n\nIn this place of dust and dreams, we carve out our days, each one a thread in the tapestry of this desert life.",
            "In the telling of my neighborhood, there is a strangeness to the tale that might not find its echo in the stories of others. Where others might speak of streets lined with houses and lives lived behind closed doors, mine is the tale of a campus that sprawls like a quiet testament to learning, and of a dormitory that whispers its secrets in the hush of night. This is my neighborhood, with its peculiar rhythms and its own quiet cadences. \n\nThis place, this campus, is a constellation of houses. There are the apartments, each a small world unto itself, holding within its walls two to four souls, lives interwoven, and stories shared. Each building rises but two floors, twenty lives suspended therein, like stars in a firmament. Then there are the houses, scattered and few, standing like sentinels in the landscape, offering shelter to those with ties to the school, alumni who linger in the embrace of their old haunt. And then, the dormitories, vast and cavernous, where hundreds of students find their rest, two to a room, sometimes more, the hum of their lives a quiet symphony in the night.\n\nThe people here are a tapestry of color and culture, each thread a unique hue, weaving a narrative that is rich and varied. They come from places far and wide, the professional staff finding their refuge in the scattered houses, the new students in the dormitories, and the older ones in apartments, each finding their place in this communal dance.\n\nThe heart of this neighborhood beats with the rhythm of its stores and its solitary park. The shops offer a bounty of choices, dining options that speak of the world beyond these walls, and the school's own peculiar offerings of clothing and sustenance. It is a place where the needs of life can be met without ever leaving its bounds. And the park, a green sanctuary in the midst of it all, a playground for the diverse souls who call this place home, kept clean and safe by the unseen hands of its community.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, a place woven from the threads of lives lived in proximity and purpose, a world unto itself.",
            "There were no sidewalks to speak of where I lived. Everything leaned toward the earth's pull, and our house stood at the peak of the steepest hill known around these parts. Folks called it the \"workout hill\" on account of the joggers who made a ritual of its ascent. With no sidewalks, the road became the path for all, pocked and treacherous underfoot or wheel. Telephone wires slung across the block sagged like old clotheslines, patched and piecemeal from the storms that raged and tore at them with impunity. The rain came often, smothering the land with its gray shroud. Tall evergreens rose sentinel-like, their presence despised for the way they blocked the ocean's view. Thus the houses climbed the hill, glass faces turned seaward, vying for the bay's embrace. At sunset, the water glowed as if lit from beneath, the sky a canvas of orange fire, though more often than not the clouds stifled the light, leaving behind a world dim and muted. In such a place, moss claimed dominion, creeping over roofs, cars, railings, until all bore its green mantle. I left my car to the elements once, and when I returned, it was a moss-cloaked monolith, demanding hours of labor to free it from nature's grip.\n\nChildren were scarce, though a school lay just a few blocks distant. The neighborhood was a bastion for the aged, those who had set aside the burdens of work. In place of children, there were dogs, a legion of them, roaming lawns and racing down streets, slipping through open doors like shadows. One found its way into my home, and I had to chase it out as one might a wayward spirit. Rabbits too ran wild, digging and burrowing, to the gardeners' despair, but my cats hunted them with a fervor born of ancient instincts. Birds flitted about, the small and the swift, with the occasional hawk or eagle passing by, only to be harried by crows until they vanished. Stores were absent, but a descent to the waterfront revealed eateries offering the sea's bounty. The shore was not one of sand but of stone, where rocks begged to be cast into the bay's embrace. The bay itself was a narrow expanse, the far shore visible even through the mist's persistent veil.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, a place you won’t find hard to reach. Public transport runs like a lifeline through the city, a pulse in the arteries of New York, and there you'll find yourself still steeped in the urban sprawl. Walk these streets and see the Asian markets sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. Two decades have drawn them here, their presence felt in every block, every corner. Supermarkets and laundromats dominion. The locals, they favor them for the food is rich and the prices kinder and the convenience a godsend. Four Asian supermarkets lie just a stone's throw from where I stand, clustered together like kinfolk. Convenience, they call it, this nearness of grocery within arm's reach.\n\nStill, Bensonhurst is not all Asian faces. A mosaic, this place, of immigrants and their children, first and second generations finding their place under the sun. The great businesses, the ones that draw the eye, are theirs. And close by, a park remade anew, with ten courts for basketball, a broad field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings and a playground for the young ones. A fountain too, where children laugh and splash away summer's heat. Parks, like the city, are a tapestry of faces and colors, woven together in play.\n\nThe skyline here is low, no towering corporate monoliths. Co-ops and condos rise up, but mostly homes built for two families, neighbors close enough to hear the hum of life. The people, they are kind enough but noisy. Cars drive by with music loud enough to rattle windows and engines revving like a call to arms, waking you with the morning light.\n\nNight brings its own counsel. The streets are mostly safe, but dark corners breed uncertainty. You might encounter those with mischief in their eyes, bullies and thieves who take what isn’t theirs. I’ve felt their fists before, long ago, and more recent still are the hands that steal packages from steps. And then there are the dogs and their masters who care not for the law. Fines do nothing to mend what is broken in them. A morning walk is a dance around the waste they leave, a nuisance that grates upon the soul. Mind your shoes as you make your way.",
            "The first thing to reckon with about Portland, Oregon is the notion of what it means to be \"weird\". A mural scrawled across a building's backside, housing a pizza joint and a bar and a music hall and a strip club, each flirting with the fringes of legality, declares \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a plea to recall the Portland from the nineties and early aughts, a city less renowned and less dear, a crucible of creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is now a badge of honor. Despite the tide of prosperous Californians and the ceaseless rise of condominiums to harbor them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weird doesn't mean always embracing, but it means a tolerance for the unordinary. Weird doesn't mean we're devoid of modernities nor struggles. Like the rest of the nation, our wares mostly hail from China. There are multitudes of ways to be weird, to be unorthodox, and yet Portland has its fill of the ordinary. It has yoga and hipsters and buttoned-down professionals. Perhaps weird means we hold all these with a looser grip. In my quarter, as in many of Portland's quarters, houses bloom in color, gardens blossom with flowers and herbs and vegetables along the lanes, and in summer, free boxes appear. These free boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items cast away by their owners but waiting to be claimed by passersby. They hold a magic, a serendipity, offering treasures perfect for the one who happens upon them. Clothes and books are common finds, though the contents can be anything. The enchantment of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of what Portland means to me, though I am but one shade of weird among countless others. Some among us would never dream of clothing themselves from a box on the curb. Those folk attend goat yoga—yes, yoga amidst goats—or cheer at the Timbers' soccer matches. Portland abounds with folk devoted to all manner of pursuits. It abounds with folk chasing dreams, or dreaming of the chase while spending hours at the bar. Indeed, Portland grapples with a drug problem. Such troubles often root in the soil of mental health, and the unending rain, the somber clouds, surely have a hand in it. Homelessness haunts us too, an enigma resisted by all. The homeless come drawn by Portland's services, kinder than most, though still wanting, as they are everywhere. The housed sway between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stood like sentinels, immutable in the north where they bore witness to the sun’s eternal passage. Each dawn, each dusk, they watched as if the great orb's journey were no more than the turning of a wheel. I could forget them in the clamor of days, in the weight of work and the clutches of life, yet still they remained, patient and indifferent to the fleeting troubles of men. On days when the world crowded in and pressed heavy upon me, they called out, and I would turn to them. They offered solace to a weary soul, strength enough to face the coming day. I first came to this place as a youth, drawn by the university and its promise of knowledge. Yet it was the mountains north of the campus that seized my heart. The university boasted its own wonders, with its stately buildings and tranquil ponds and trees that whispered of time and seasons. These too claimed a part of me, but it was the mountains that held sway. The town lay beneath them, beautiful in its own right. Countless cafés became my refuge, where hours of study found fuel in endless cups of coffee. A short walk or bus ride brought one to the heart of downtown, where faded bricks lined streets and spoke of years gone by. Here, the town shed its suburban skin, bustling with the vigor of its urban neighbors, though the clamor ebbed away within a few blocks. Beyond the library, serenity awaited, the town's quiet soul. This juxtaposition of life and stillness lent the city a certain magic, a siren song that promised discovery. In such a place, memories wove themselves into the fabric of the streets. Nights spent with friends beneath the rusted swings in the park, or rushing through the crowd to catch a film at the theater, a gift from the university. Yet the city held its share of sorrow, as all places must. The ponds, their surfaces mirrored the sky, a fitting stage for reflection or midnight tears. In the midst of an existential dread, I found myself there often. Watching the turtles and ducks and insects, each carrying out its simple purpose, I questioned my own. I wandered past the pond, through the park, past neat little houses that spoke of suburban life, until the main street opened before me. The sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I looked up, I saw the north stretched before me. There they were, as they had always been. The mountains, steadfast and eternal, brushed against the blue and yellow heavens, towering over all. In their silent majesty, they stirred within me a sense of resolve, a whisper of endurance that would not be silenced.",
            "You might pass it by without a second look. A place that doesn't catch the eye, hidden in the folds of a quiet town, tucked behind the tired facades of a shopping strip. The kind of place that seems unlikely for living, where folks wouldn't choose to settle. And yet, beyond the husk of an old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty but for the once-a-year gatherings of kin in summer's warm embrace, lies a community alive and unsung. Streets lined with apartments, each complex a part of a larger whole, like Russian dolls that have been meticulously laid out side by side, their secrets whispered to those who know where to listen. The first set of apartments has seen its share of scandal, tales told in hushed voices, tales that paint a picture darker than the truth. But beyond, a different world breathes, unknown to the many who dwell in these parts. Across from these sentinels of life stands the quiet campus of a community college, its buildings watching over the road. Students shuffle in with steaming cups as day breaks, their eyes heavy with the promise of knowledge, while the iron gates groan in welcome. Commuters scowl from their cars, impatient with the slow procession of those seeking enlightenment. The road splits then, one path leading to a park where laughter echoes, and the other to a place of healing, where broken bodies mend. The center speaks of comfort, with its inviting porches and whispering fans that stir the heavy air. Children race across the park, their limbs a blur of joy among the tall grass, bees dancing lazily in the blossoms. Elderly folks walk their dogs, casting disapproving glances at the youth who skate with abandon, while clusters of girls share secrets by the swings. Nearby, a strip mall offers its own quiet tales. A sushi joint with fare that's good but seldom sought, a shop selling summer's promise in swimming gear, and a salon where nails find their gloss. Here, one could linger, juggling life's small pleasures—a pool's cool embrace, a touch of polish, a plate of hibachi. Even a place to find frozen delight, sweet and cold in the hands of teens who ride the edge of recklessness under the southern sun. This neighborhood, a small reflection of the nation's heart, a snapshot of the enduring South where time slips by like the gentle flow of a river, unchanged and unchanging.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawling under the wide and open sky, the houses lined up like quiet sentinels of a bygone dream. Most were homes for single families, yet some had been cleaved in two, standing side by side as if unsure of their own symmetry. My own stood with its small yard and its slender driveway, a relic of an era when the suburbs whispered promises of the American dream. Once, this dream embraced the land and its people, but now it drifts like smoke. Still, the neighborhood endures, its voice a distant echo of hope, speaking to those who wander its streets that the dream holds on by a thread.\n\nThe folks here, their optimism has faded like the paint on the picket fences, the yards not tended as they once were. Yet cars remain parked in driveways, and the children play in the streets as if the world they knew was the only world that mattered. The old schoolhouse, nearly ninety years in its standing, breathes life into the young and churns up memories for the old. Churches are sparse, mostly hollowed out, yet the courts are alive with the sound of leather against pavement.\n\nEach home wears a different face, yet they share a common soul. There is the supermarket called Super \"A,\" its aisles watched over by a Yemeni family, perhaps the sole Arab presence in these parts. Most here are African American, their roots deep in the earth of this place. The streets are wide, and the children's games pause only for the passing of cars. Many families have been here for generations, their stories woven into the fabric of the past where all knew each other by name.\n\nThere was a karate school once, but Hollywood turned away from such dreams, and now it is a pharmacy, for some say pills soothe where dreams cannot. A small theater still stands, offering old films at a price that draws the elders but leaves the young unmoved. An expressway cuts through the town, its exits beyond our borders. Once, there was a clamor for an exit here, the young in favor, the old against. They said it would spoil the town, and in the end, the city council listened to their quiet wisdom.\n\nThey're raising a new high school now, and we ponder a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin might just capture the heart of this place.",
            "The city sprawls in its vastness, a tapestry of lives interwoven yet distinct. Here, where the streets wind erratically among towers of commerce, life unfolds in a patchwork of humanity. Offices stand in rows like sentinels, their windows darkened by the shadows of monoliths. Shops and eateries abound, each a world unto itself, drawing wanderers in with the promise of sustenance or some fleeting escape. Grand emporiums of renown mark the landscape, countered by humble boutiques that cling to the city's cobbled arteries. The avenues, lined with these varied establishments, pulse with the footfalls of those who dwell within neighborhoods meant for quietude yet touched by the ever-present hum of urban life.\n\nParks, mere patches of green amidst the concrete sea, offer respite to those seeking solace beneath their boughs. Children play, their laughter echoing the innocence of days unspoiled. In this place, diversity is not a claim but a living truth. The streets tell tales of those who came from lands afar—their languages a symphony, their customs a tapestry. Here, the LGBTQ+ community finds its voice alongside the devout chants of the Orthodox, and the stories of those who fled the shadow of the Soviet Union unfold with each step taken.\n\nBeyond these streets, the city stretches further, a mosaic of enclaves each with its own identity. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—names that speak of heritage and belonging, yet the journey to each is fraught with the trials of traffic that binds the city in its relentless grip. Miles pass slowly beneath the wheels, the hours marked by the stagnant crawl of vehicles in endless procession. The irony of a city so vast is its constriction, for though the distances may be short, the passage is long and wearying.\n\nYet, they come still. The cranes rise, and new towers reach for the heavens as if the earth itself might yield more space. The city draws them in, but not without dissent. For with each new soul, the roads grow fuller, the spaces tighter. Those who have called this place home watch the change with wary eyes.\n\nIn this labyrinth, homes take many forms. Towers of glass and steel stand alongside modest dwellings, each a sanctuary for its inhabitants. Some find solace in the singular embrace of family homes, while others share walls in duplexes. The streets of my own neighborhood, a microcosm of the city itself, reveal a myriad of domiciles, each sheltering lives as varied as the cityscape. Yet, in this place of infinite variety, familiarity is a rare currency. The faces of neighbors slip by like shadows, unknown and unknowing, save for the echoes of childhood laughter that linger in the memory of games once played in the fading light of simpler days.",
            "The road stretched out through the fields of corn, endless and vast, where the horizon seemed to hold the very sky. She peered out, eyes wide, the silence of the land standing in stark contrast to the world she knew, where the grocery store was a mere stroll from her door. But here, there was only the earth, boundless and unbroken, and I told her of my Ohio, of my youth in a place where land was the measure of a man. Down the narrow road, past the quarry brimming with water that mirrored the heavens, lay the small gathering of homes where I lived. Each house, a fortress of brick and stucco, staked its claim on the earth, a half-acre of pride in every yard. In spring, the gardens burst forth, a riot of flowers beneath the weathered limbs of trees that marked the seasons with their changing hues.\n\nThe driveways shimmered with the polish of fine Mercedes, a gleam in the sun that spoke of care and labor. As I neared my gray stucco home, there was my neighbor, the Korean, always with a song on his lips and the mower's drone beneath his voice. He was a man whose years had taken some of his sharpness, yet his heart was ever true. Once a healer, now he tended his grass as diligently as he once did his patients, becoming one with the earth and his John Deere.\n\nWhen you arrive at my home, the geese are there, bold amid the grass, and our Terrier, ever the hunter, gives chase. Beyond, a stream weaves through the land, a quiet melody against the distant calls of cows. Across the bridge of wood, crafted by hand, lies a sanctuary untouched by time, where trees and wildflowers grow as they will. Here was the cradle of my childhood, a realm of forts and pursuits, where imagination ran as wild as the creatures we chased.\n\nWinter came with its own harsh beauty, casting the land in white, the living world turned to stillness. The trees stood bare, sentinels in a frozen expanse, yet when snow graced the ground, it became a canvas for angels and snowmen, the work of my sister's hands. We were warriors in those days, snowballs our weapons, forts of snow and branch our bastions. There, in our winter kingdom, we found the freedom of children, untouched by the world beyond."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, where the land stretches out in vast tapestries, lies the small town of Michigan. A place where fields yield to quaint tourist hamlets, and the notion of sprawling city malls and chains like Wal-Mart or Target remains a distant echo. Here, every journey demands the road. And yet, this is among the world's most beautiful places, flanked by waters on all sides. The town itself, cradled between the mighty Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. A place where the shoreline is never far, and the sands invite the weary to wade in.\n\nOur neighborhood speaks the language of small-town America. Homes stand apart, not pressed together like the crowded bricks of a cityscape. These are no uniform dwellings; each bears its own story. Some are old, having seen the years pass, while others wear the newness of renovation. Basements, full and visible from the street, anchor these houses, many clad in the armor of aged aluminum siding. All colors of the spectrum paint the blocks around my home, a patchwork quilt of humanity. Each house with its own little realm, yards adorned with trampolines and swing sets. Gardens bloom, fences contain the creatures that share our lives. Middle America, they call it. A place of earnest folk, toiling through the days, nurturing families or watching them grow.\n\nOn any day, children race along the streets, laughter echoing between the homes. Dogs with eager tails lead their humans on walks, bicycles roll, and rollerblades whisper over the pavement. Neighbors know each other here, woven into the fabric of community. A wave from the grill, a nod from the dog walker a few blocks down. The lawns are kept, leaves of autumn are not left to languish. Grass, green and tamed, bushes and plants trimmed and tidy. This is not a neighborhood of grandeur, but one of warmth. A place where families find solace, where the quiet and the calm weave a tapestry of safety. The kind of place where you feel the world has provided a haven at the end of the day.\n\nA short walk finds the county sheriff’s department and jail, a sentinel of order. The health department stands beside it, a bastion of care. Down the road, the city recycling center hums with purpose, serving the people diligently. Nearby, the crack of bat against ball rings out from the baseball and softball fields, the announcers' voices carrying the names of dreams through the air. The small town airport rests beyond, its engines a distant rumble as planes rise and fall from the earth. Ice cream waits in the heart of town, a sweet reward within reach. The park stands merely eight blocks from our door, a sanctuary for my children and their bikes. This place, in its quiet certainty, is a treasure. A truly fine place to call home.",
            "The place I call home lies on the margins of the city, a stretch of land caught between the whispers of the wild and the orderly hum of suburbia. Here, the hand of the homeowner's association guides all, a silent overseer ensuring that each house stands a mirror to its neighbor. The lawns, neat and trimmed, are but small patches of green, bordered by decorative stones and short driveways that speak of uniformity, of order. Each house guards a two-car garage, and the roadways, freshly laid and smooth, defy the wear of time and tread.\n\nThe homes mostly rise a single story, with the occasional two-story among them, like rare trees in a manicured forest. Gone are the solitary mailboxes that once marked each threshold; now, a cluster of metal boxes stands sentinel at street's end, keys in hand for those who seek their post, parcels tucked away in larger lockers. This, too, is the work of the association, their quest for sameness leaving no stone unturned.\n\nOn these edges where suburb meets the rural, there is space enough for all manner of things. Community pools lie within their gates, pristine and welcoming, while paths wind through the neighborhood, inviting the wanderer or the dog walker to stroll beneath the open sky. There is no need for parks here; the land itself offers room to run, to breathe.\n\nThe people who dwell here are mostly those who've seen the years pass, retirees who keep watch over the quiet streets, their vigilance a comfort to all. Yet among them, a smattering of middle-aged and young professionals find their place, bringing with them the pulse of life's earlier rhythms.\n\nBeyond, the city sprawls, a contradiction of size and intimacy. Its heart beats with the rhythm of a town both large and small, offering the amenities one might seek, though not in abundance. A mall stands modestly, sufficient in its offerings, a mere quarter-hour's drive from the neighborhood's embrace. Once arrived, a world of shops unfolds, from the high-end grocers with their organic fare to the bargain outlets, their shelves sparse and staff few.\n\nIn this place, safety and order reign. The pools and trails are but the surface of its charms, and though the shops lie a drive away, the roads lead ever onward to the chains and stores that promise all one might need. This is the world of my childhood, the shape of home.",
            "The first I knew of that place was from the voice of a stranger on a podcast, a story spun from the mysteries of the missing. The revelation was unexpected. In that quarter, apartments fetched a princely sum each month, a thousand dollars or more. Yet of this tale, neither I nor my kin had ever heard mention. Perhaps it was the struggle that kept it veiled. Nights were soaked in tears for some of my friends, the weight of expense pressing hard. But we had mastered frugality. The scent of bygone relics from the flea market came to be a comfort, the odor of mothballed garments a familiar embrace. In the years of adulthood, you notice less. Perhaps you take to smoking, or merely grow accustomed to the world’s state. Yet the market’s essence permeates all, the dusty tomes piled on a silent piano, clinging to leather long after the wash. \n\nHere, within a stone’s throw, lie three thrift stores. Begin at one edge and you traverse two charity thrifts, a library shadowed by age, a rare book emporium, and a curio shop. Downtown thrums with life, streets choked with the ceaseless flow of cars and people, yet within the thrift stores, silence reigns. A fine refuge for the afternoon’s loss. Each year, the tide of humanity swells, this city in its throes of becoming. They speak of development, the city a nexus for a vast empire of commerce and delivery, still aching with its growth. It conjures the specter of New York, each soul in pursuit of its own end, unburdened by the expectations of others. Solitude is a cherished right, independence a quiet creed, and none will intrude. Unlike the South, where concern is the currency of care, here lives remain unexamined if one wills it. The city rises and recedes like the ocean’s breath upon the shore, a vibrant tapestry. \n\nWithin the confines of my dwelling, life stirs. The pianist’s strains next door, the harmonies of singers above. Here, strangers are kin, a community forged in shared necessity. We gather for life’s markers, its joys and sorrows, lending aid where we can. Fortune has placed me here, among neighbors I cherish, who return my regard. I strive to leave no trace but kindness, sharing the bounty of my kitchen, as they do with me. We exchange letters and parcels, a ritual of connection. Their presence is a solace, and I believe mine is received likewise. In this sprawling mass of concrete and steel, it is these souls who stave off the void, who remind me that my choices have not been in vain.",
            "In the quiet heart of the Midwest, where the fields stretch out like a patchwork quilt, lies a town just beyond the reach of the city’s suburban sprawl. On its eastern fringe sits our neighborhood, perhaps the least prosperous by any measure of wealth. The homes are modest, often rented or owned by those who watch the pennies, their paint peeling beneath the sun's relentless gaze. Yet, it is a place not without its own kind of beauty, a rough-hewn charm that speaks to the soul. The folks here are kind, their greetings warm as the summer sun when you pass them by on the cracked sidewalks. Crime does not haunt us like a specter, though it has whispered its presence here in the form of violence, a shadow that slips through the darkened streets every few years. A neighbor’s boy fell to a gun’s bark outside the neon haze of a bar last year, the echoes of that night still linger, like a mournful wind through the trees. Our family, by some grace, has been spared such direct sorrow save for the odd possession vanished from our porch, forgotten to be brought inside.\n\nThis town of ours, like so many others across the vast expanse of this land, bears the deep scars of an epidemic. The opioid crisis has cut a swath, leaving in its wake those who have succumbed to the siren call of fentanyl. Yet there are those who fight against the tide, places of healing and hope, where the afflicted seek redemption, and others learn to wield Narcan like a shield against despair. \n\nIn the midst of these tribulations, there blooms much that is good. My son’s school, a haven of learning and laughter, stands as a testament to what can be achieved even in trying times. The teachers there, from principal down to the support staff, are pillars of strength and kindness. That he has never been the target of cruelty despite his needs is a blessing, testament to the nurturing soil of that place. The PTO, vibrant and alive, orchestrates moments of joy and learning, drawing families into the fold. Here, where poverty humbles more than a fifth of our people, no child knows the pangs of hunger at school. Meals are given freely, and dignity is preserved amidst the struggle. The city fathers have turned their gaze upon the town's image, paving roads, tending to parks, though their focus leans westward where commerce thrives and the traffic flows. Our side of town remains in waiting, a fact not lost on those of us who call it home.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, this town holds us in its embrace. The people, the schools, the shops that line the streets—they meet our needs. Our home, humble though it may be, is a sanctuary, its worth measured not in dollars but in memories. Sixteen years we have dwelled here, and in all the vastness of the world, there is no other place we would call our own.",
            "The neighborhood sits upon a hill, its streets winding their way between buildings that whisper tales of history to those who listen. It is a place of culture, where the past and present collide in the shadows of the old live theater that stands across from my seven-story apartment building. Down the slope, a humble block away, lies an arcade bar, a haven for souls adrift in the warm breath of summer nights. In the heat of June and July, a line of eager faces stretches along the pavement, waiting for entry, chasing the promise of laughter and light.\n\nAbove, the city park sprawls, an expanse of green in a quarter where space is a luxury. Concrete encircles it like a fortress wall, its surface broken by the jagged teeth of stairs carved into its face. When winter's chill descends, the homeless gather, their tents a patchwork quilt upon the sidewalk and steps, seeking refuge from the rain's relentless assault. It is a hard life, lived in proximity to the family center where warmth and water can be found.\n\nYet, it is not the proud architecture nor the storied structures that capture my heart, but the soul of the people who tread these streets. Hilltop, once a name spoken in fear, echoes with stories of days when the air was thick with the presence of federal agents and the DEA, sweeping through like a cleansing storm. The people remember, and the tales pass from lip to ear, generation to generation, until they reach even newcomers like me. The spirit here is one of resilience, a determination to reclaim and redefine.\n\nThey say the Hill is no place for a white face after dark, a warning born of old fears and misconceptions. But perhaps it is my skin, dark enough to blend, or perhaps the Hilltop recognizes its own in me, one who sees the threads of racism and fear woven into the fabric of our nation. Here, in this so-called cultural utopia, I find a home. The streets pulse with life beneath my feet, each step a testament to the kindness that resides in unexpected places.\n\nWalking these streets at night, I have been met not with malice but with generosity, offered warmth instead of harm. The laundromat owner who keeps the lights on for me, the stranger who presses a crumpled bill into my hand, seeing value where I saw none. These are the moments that bind me to this place, knit me into its story. Hilltop is more than a neighborhood; it is a testament to the enduring spirit of its people, a reminder that home is found in the hearts of those who walk beside you.",
            "I came to this place when the world was just beginning to open its doors to me, the eighth grade looming like a distant horizon. At first, the air was thick with unfamiliarity, the faces all strange and distant. But in time, as it will, the world shifted. I found kinship in the boy two doors down and another lad who called my street home. They've since wandered on, as people do, but their echoes remain etched into the fabric of this place. Most who were here at my coming still tread the same paths, ghosts of their younger selves. The neighborhood, a reflection of the American dream, sprawls with its two-story houses standing sentinel. The weekends bring a symphony of youthful exuberance, the laughter and shouts of children caught in the warmth of the sun. Silence hangs over the weekdays like a shroud. We've all kept our peace here, no quarrels to speak of. Solitude is the norm unless a hand is needed. The parcels I've ordered have always found their way unmolested, a testament to the trust that binds this place. A park lies but a stone's throw from my door, and in it, a tapestry of memories, both bright and shadowed. We've played the games of youth there, my companions and I, until the day the world turned red with pain from an errant elbow. But even that memory fades beneath the weight of joyous days. Now, it is the realm of my cousin's children, their laughter a bridge to my past, their delight in swings and slides a mirror to my own gone days. The park is a vessel of nostalgia, a keeper of time. Here, the world converges in its diversity, each face a story, each dish a journey. Within a mile's reach, flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy whisper their tales. Yet, in these times, many choose the path of least resistance, letting the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash bring the world to their doorsteps. Fast food reigns as king, a staple of suburban life, with pizza places dotting the map like stars. The stores hold all one might need, a Walgreens and CVS standing guard, alongside Jewel-Osco, a familiar name in the Midwest. Even here, the world finds its way in, an Indian shop offering a taste of home or adventure. In all, I find solace in this neighborhood. The tales of woe and strife I hear from afar serve only to deepen my gratitude for the peace I know here.",
            "The neighborhood I call home rests in close proximity to the college, a fact that lends a certain convenience to my days. The landscape is dotted with apartment buildings, their facades worn with time, and among them, a scattering of restaurants and bars that beckon with modest charms and costs. One of these bars, now bearing a new name, demands a heavier toll for its libations, yet its offerings are not the worst one might endure. The people, mostly students and those of lesser means, find their refuge here, the rent not beyond reach. Children roam, their laughter carried on the air from the nearby school, a stone's throw from my abode.\n\nThe faces of my neighbors remain a mystery, a distance I find suitable. Their penchant for smoke has summoned a fragrant retribution from the building's overseers, an air freshener planted like a sentinel at their door, a jest shared in quiet amusement with my companion. These structures, aged in visage, might conceal interiors touched by modern hands. Down the way, new apartments rise, their construction a flimsy artifice betrayed by exorbitant rents, a ruse abetted by their nearness to the campus grounds.\n\nA humble eatery lies but five minutes' walk, its fare served on paper, warmed by the hum of machinery. Across the way, a gas station stands, its reputation as an employer shadowed by whispers. Yet, the city’s coin has brought fresh roads, wide sidewalks, and green upon medians, a veneer of civility. My own dwelling finds itself cloaked in trees, save for stumps where some were felled. Behind lies a line of trees, beyond which another set of apartments stands. I reside on 42nd street, while the next, 43rd, shows the wear of years, its sidewalks crumbling, its buildings cloaked in neglect, the trees a screen against the eyes.\n\nCrime has its haunt on that thoroughfare, though blame does not rest solely there. Across from me, too, the shadows linger, a transient tide flowing through. Still, I find a contentment in this place. It suits my purse and offers what I need. The university, a short walk away, and the buses, ready to carry me to the heart of the city or to the store, make life here more than bearable.",
            "In the elbow of the road where the cul-de-sac bends, the duplexes stand like solitary houses, their yellow skin, white porches, and green metal roofs under the expansive sky. Folks here, almost kin in their quiet camaraderie, gather by the driveways as the sun dips low, the children weaving dreams from chalk and kite string. The air, thick with the scent of the earth and the chatter of neighbors, feels untouched by the clamor of the world beyond. Fields and trees cradle us, the sky a canvas of blue and white.  \n\nYet, this season, the air carries whispers of storms, the threats of tornadoes. Last night, the sirens wailed, their call cutting through the dusk, and I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my littlest dog, a purse, and a few pillows. The big dog stayed out in the living room, his bark echoing the thrum of the hail that pelted the earth. Outside, the world seemed to hold its breath, the storm's aftermath leaving the road steaming, the temperature plummeting from 92 to 75 in a heartbeat. The hail, hot against the pavement, melted swiftly, and as the skies cleared, a double rainbow arched across the horizon. I seized my camera, capturing the marvel to share with distant kin and companions, their awe mirroring my own.\n\nThe streets lay hushed for an hour before life resumed its rhythm, children and mothers emerging as the fragrance of dinners wafted from open windows. For a northerner newly settled in the South, this neighborhood is a balm, the lilt of southern voices a melody to my ears. Each duplex, a mirror of the next, holds its secrets within, rooms of varying dimensions behind identical facades. I often wander to the broad field behind us, tracing the path to the pond where the deer tread softly and the bullfrog's song greets the dawn. Just forty minutes from Charlotte, it feels a world away, roosters heralding the morning from nearby farms. And as night falls, the bray of a donkey from a distant farm reminds us of our place in this patch of earth. This neighborhood is a found treasure, nestled in the heart of the world.",
            "The years have passed in this place and I reckon I’ve come to know it some. At first, I was filled with a kind of sorrow when we left the streets of Riverdale behind. I cried for what was gone, for the kin and the kind I had known there. My folks, they had the notion to find a better life for me and my sister, so we moved on to Stockbridge where the schools and the houses were finer, where the air seemed less filled with the ghosts of the old life. Time carried on and I made new friends there and some enemies too, as one does. The neighbors were mostly strangers to me save for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived close by. They became like family, a comfort I came to value. I remember the day when we all went to Mr. Glen’s wedding, this remarrying of his with Ms. Veda. A day filled with laughter and promise. I caught the garter she tossed, but the flowers eluded me. We danced long into the night and I remember that time with Marsharii, their daughter, though she has since gone her own way. I hope the world has treated her well. The neighborhood is a tangle, a labyrinth of streets and stories, but with a GPS now I’ve explored deeper. My friends Kason and Curtis and I would wander and play, losing ourselves in the games of youth, seeking joy wherever it was to be found. Sometimes I would take to the park, where the quiet of nature would settle in me, a balm for the restless soul. I’d balance on sticks or wield my wooden sword, finding solace in these small pleasures. There are courts for tennis and basketball, though I’ve not played in some time, taught by my father and Mr. Graves who worked us hard but filled those days with laughter. This place has held many a memory, each one etched into the time spent here, and I reckon the finest are yet to come.",
            "The town lay quiet under the South Carolina sun, a small place not unlike others but known far and wide for the peaches that grew in its soil. Johnston, they called it, and the sign as you entered spoke proudly of it being the Peach Capital of the World. Farmlands stretched out on every side, rows of peach trees and cattle grazing in the fields. Houses stood some distance apart, their metal roofs glinting against the summer's heat, or gray shingles weathered and old. They were set back from the road, leaving the land before them open for crops and beasts.\n\nIn the heart of the town hung a solitary stoplight above the four-way, beneath which lay the few stores that served the people. A Chinese place, Hong Kong, run by a family, and Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, where you could get a burger to go. There had been a pizzeria once, but it shut its doors not long ago. A small pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, offered more than medicine, known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sold. \n\nThe grocer, IGA, was the only one in town, but folks often drove to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main shopping. Dollar General was where the people came, a small store bustling from dawn to dusk, shelves laden with the needs of everyday life. A furniture place, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman whose name everyone knew, stood with its doors open, employing two men to deliver what was bought. Next to it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels offered care for the animals, grooming and boarding and such.\n\nThere were small practices for doctoring and veterinary needs, both away from the main street but capable enough for Johnston's needs. Johnston Elementary was the school, and after the fifth grade, the children moved on to the next town for further schooling. There was no park in Johnston, though they talked of making a space for families and visitors, a place of 2.5 acres where life might find some leisure.\n\nThere were no cinemas or alleys for bowling, no place for the young to gather, no playgrounds for the children, nor paths for walking the dogs. The eateries were few and far between. But it was a town of its own, small enough that one might miss it if they didn't slow down to look, passing by with just a blink and it would be gone.",
            "In a small southern town of Tennessee, there’s a stretch of suburbia where I have made my home. The street runs between two state highways, a ribbon of asphalt that carries more traffic than I’d care for, though the neighborhood itself keeps mostly to its own quiet rhythms. Folks here do not come and go with much frequency, and so the faces have become familiar, like the slow turn of seasons. Yard work occupies the hands of the people, and the days pass with the hum of lawnmowers from March to October, a constant chorus beneath the green canopy that shades us. In winter, such as it is, we sled down the hill, though winter has grown thin, more of a long autumn now.\n\nOur house stands at the street’s corner, a sentry watching all who pass, and we know the parade of cars by their daily ritual. A strange vehicle catches our eye, an anomaly in the habitual landscape. The neighbors walk their dogs, children ride their bicycles, and life unspools as one would expect. We dwell here, my wife and I, with our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. Our comings and goings are part of the neighborhood’s fabric, as we work from home, stepping out to play even in the rain’s embrace.\n\nOn occasion, the grill on our back deck sends forth the scent of barbecue, a fragrant signal of time well spent. The trees, remnants of a forest long subdued, offer shade and a bounty of leaves come autumn. The smoke of burning leaves, a perfume of the season’s turning, is a welcome herald of fall’s arrival.\n\nThe garage is my sanctuary at the house’s rear, a place for the truck and small projects. With doors open, I feel the pulse of the street, the heartbeat of the neighborhood. Holidays bring a hush, save for the influx of cars during Thanksgiving or the like, when families gather and the street fills with the presence of those from afar. \n\nHere, in this place, I find contentment. Perfect it is not, for the road draws traffic, yet it is home, and I have come to love it as one loves the flawed and familiar.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where the earth swells in barren waves of dust and grit, lies my neighborhood. A land of endless brown, the kind that seeps into your bones until even the notion of green feels foreign. If one were to stumble upon a patch of lawn, it stands not as a testament to nature but to the wallet of its keeper. When I first set roots here back in the nineties, the houses were scattered like lone sentinels across the desolate expanse. Time has drawn them closer, though the land still stretches wide with new growth creeping in like tendrils of some slow, creeping vine. This place takes on the guise of a city, yet it remains caught between worlds, shifting and changing as all places do with the passage of years.\n\nThe folks here, they're good people mostly, though like in any cluster of humanity, you've your saints and your sinners. My corner of the world, it's a haven of kindly elders, a quieter enclave amidst the expanse. Chain stores dot the landscape, names familiar to all—Food For Less, Smart and Final. For something finer, a journey is required, as stores like Whole Foods are but whispers on the wind here. Construction is the lifeblood of this city, not that numbers would tell you, but the wide-open spaces lay ready for the hammer and nail. It unsettles me some, this constant build and change. I fled the sprawl of a great city once and have no mind to return. My trade is among these builders; I ply my hands in drywall and T-bar, a craftsman shaping the bones of new abodes.\n\nThe desert's stark beauty draws many, a vast tapestry of rugged life where creatures eke out an existence in the harsh embrace of the land. We who dwell here have learned the ways of our fellow denizens: lizards and insects that scuttle across the sands. My three children, wild with the wonder of youth, spend their days in pursuit of these desert denizens, gathering them like treasures in the palms of their hands.\n\nThis place has its lures, and for those who seek them, they are here to be found. Victorville stands as a gateway to a different kind of existence. Each year, the San Bernardino County Fair breathes life into the desert, a carnival of laughter and light. And should you wander further, Wrightwood awaits with its snow-capped peaks, offering the promise of winter's chill and the thrill of sport. For those with a mind to learn of the land's history, the Victor Valley Museum holds tales of stone and bone, of those who walked here long before the world was as it is now.\n\nIn this place of dust and dreams, we carve out our days, each one a thread in the tapestry of this desert life.",
            "In the telling of my neighborhood, there is a strangeness to the tale that might not find its echo in the stories of others. Where others might speak of streets lined with houses and lives lived behind closed doors, mine is the tale of a campus that sprawls like a quiet testament to learning, and of a dormitory that whispers its secrets in the hush of night. This is my neighborhood, with its peculiar rhythms and its own quiet cadences. \n\nThis place, this campus, is a constellation of houses. There are the apartments, each a small world unto itself, holding within its walls two to four souls, lives interwoven, and stories shared. Each building rises but two floors, twenty lives suspended therein, like stars in a firmament. Then there are the houses, scattered and few, standing like sentinels in the landscape, offering shelter to those with ties to the school, alumni who linger in the embrace of their old haunt. And then, the dormitories, vast and cavernous, where hundreds of students find their rest, two to a room, sometimes more, the hum of their lives a quiet symphony in the night.\n\nThe people here are a tapestry of color and culture, each thread a unique hue, weaving a narrative that is rich and varied. They come from places far and wide, the professional staff finding their refuge in the scattered houses, the new students in the dormitories, and the older ones in apartments, each finding their place in this communal dance.\n\nThe heart of this neighborhood beats with the rhythm of its stores and its solitary park. The shops offer a bounty of choices, dining options that speak of the world beyond these walls, and the school's own peculiar offerings of clothing and sustenance. It is a place where the needs of life can be met without ever leaving its bounds. And the park, a green sanctuary in the midst of it all, a playground for the diverse souls who call this place home, kept clean and safe by the unseen hands of its community.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, a place woven from the threads of lives lived in proximity and purpose, a world unto itself.",
            "There were no sidewalks to speak of where I lived. Everything leaned toward the earth's pull, and our house stood at the peak of the steepest hill known around these parts. Folks called it the \"workout hill\" on account of the joggers who made a ritual of its ascent. With no sidewalks, the road became the path for all, pocked and treacherous underfoot or wheel. Telephone wires slung across the block sagged like old clotheslines, patched and piecemeal from the storms that raged and tore at them with impunity. The rain came often, smothering the land with its gray shroud. Tall evergreens rose sentinel-like, their presence despised for the way they blocked the ocean's view. Thus the houses climbed the hill, glass faces turned seaward, vying for the bay's embrace. At sunset, the water glowed as if lit from beneath, the sky a canvas of orange fire, though more often than not the clouds stifled the light, leaving behind a world dim and muted. In such a place, moss claimed dominion, creeping over roofs, cars, railings, until all bore its green mantle. I left my car to the elements once, and when I returned, it was a moss-cloaked monolith, demanding hours of labor to free it from nature's grip.\n\nChildren were scarce, though a school lay just a few blocks distant. The neighborhood was a bastion for the aged, those who had set aside the burdens of work. In place of children, there were dogs, a legion of them, roaming lawns and racing down streets, slipping through open doors like shadows. One found its way into my home, and I had to chase it out as one might a wayward spirit. Rabbits too ran wild, digging and burrowing, to the gardeners' despair, but my cats hunted them with a fervor born of ancient instincts. Birds flitted about, the small and the swift, with the occasional hawk or eagle passing by, only to be harried by crows until they vanished. Stores were absent, but a descent to the waterfront revealed eateries offering the sea's bounty. The shore was not one of sand but of stone, where rocks begged to be cast into the bay's embrace. The bay itself was a narrow expanse, the far shore visible even through the mist's persistent veil.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, a place you won’t find hard to reach. Public transport runs like a lifeline through the city, a pulse in the arteries of New York, and there you'll find yourself still steeped in the urban sprawl. Walk these streets and see the Asian markets sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. Two decades have drawn them here, their presence felt in every block, every corner. Supermarkets and laundromats dominion. The locals, they favor them for the food is rich and the prices kinder and the convenience a godsend. Four Asian supermarkets lie just a stone's throw from where I stand, clustered together like kinfolk. Convenience, they call it, this nearness of grocery within arm's reach.\n\nStill, Bensonhurst is not all Asian faces. A mosaic, this place, of immigrants and their children, first and second generations finding their place under the sun. The great businesses, the ones that draw the eye, are theirs. And close by, a park remade anew, with ten courts for basketball, a broad field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings and a playground for the young ones. A fountain too, where children laugh and splash away summer's heat. Parks, like the city, are a tapestry of faces and colors, woven together in play.\n\nThe skyline here is low, no towering corporate monoliths. Co-ops and condos rise up, but mostly homes built for two families, neighbors close enough to hear the hum of life. The people, they are kind enough but noisy. Cars drive by with music loud enough to rattle windows and engines revving like a call to arms, waking you with the morning light.\n\nNight brings its own counsel. The streets are mostly safe, but dark corners breed uncertainty. You might encounter those with mischief in their eyes, bullies and thieves who take what isn’t theirs. I’ve felt their fists before, long ago, and more recent still are the hands that steal packages from steps. And then there are the dogs and their masters who care not for the law. Fines do nothing to mend what is broken in them. A morning walk is a dance around the waste they leave, a nuisance that grates upon the soul. Mind your shoes as you make your way.",
            "The first thing to reckon with about Portland, Oregon is the notion of what it means to be \"weird\". A mural scrawled across a building's backside, housing a pizza joint and a bar and a music hall and a strip club, each flirting with the fringes of legality, declares \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a plea to recall the Portland from the nineties and early aughts, a city less renowned and less dear, a crucible of creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is now a badge of honor. Despite the tide of prosperous Californians and the ceaseless rise of condominiums to harbor them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weird doesn't mean always embracing, but it means a tolerance for the unordinary. Weird doesn't mean we're devoid of modernities nor struggles. Like the rest of the nation, our wares mostly hail from China. There are multitudes of ways to be weird, to be unorthodox, and yet Portland has its fill of the ordinary. It has yoga and hipsters and buttoned-down professionals. Perhaps weird means we hold all these with a looser grip. In my quarter, as in many of Portland's quarters, houses bloom in color, gardens blossom with flowers and herbs and vegetables along the lanes, and in summer, free boxes appear. These free boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items cast away by their owners but waiting to be claimed by passersby. They hold a magic, a serendipity, offering treasures perfect for the one who happens upon them. Clothes and books are common finds, though the contents can be anything. The enchantment of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of what Portland means to me, though I am but one shade of weird among countless others. Some among us would never dream of clothing themselves from a box on the curb. Those folk attend goat yoga—yes, yoga amidst goats—or cheer at the Timbers' soccer matches. Portland abounds with folk devoted to all manner of pursuits. It abounds with folk chasing dreams, or dreaming of the chase while spending hours at the bar. Indeed, Portland grapples with a drug problem. Such troubles often root in the soil of mental health, and the unending rain, the somber clouds, surely have a hand in it. Homelessness haunts us too, an enigma resisted by all. The homeless come drawn by Portland's services, kinder than most, though still wanting, as they are everywhere. The housed sway between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stood like sentinels, immutable in the north where they bore witness to the sun’s eternal passage. Each dawn, each dusk, they watched as if the great orb's journey were no more than the turning of a wheel. I could forget them in the clamor of days, in the weight of work and the clutches of life, yet still they remained, patient and indifferent to the fleeting troubles of men. On days when the world crowded in and pressed heavy upon me, they called out, and I would turn to them. They offered solace to a weary soul, strength enough to face the coming day. I first came to this place as a youth, drawn by the university and its promise of knowledge. Yet it was the mountains north of the campus that seized my heart. The university boasted its own wonders, with its stately buildings and tranquil ponds and trees that whispered of time and seasons. These too claimed a part of me, but it was the mountains that held sway. The town lay beneath them, beautiful in its own right. Countless cafés became my refuge, where hours of study found fuel in endless cups of coffee. A short walk or bus ride brought one to the heart of downtown, where faded bricks lined streets and spoke of years gone by. Here, the town shed its suburban skin, bustling with the vigor of its urban neighbors, though the clamor ebbed away within a few blocks. Beyond the library, serenity awaited, the town's quiet soul. This juxtaposition of life and stillness lent the city a certain magic, a siren song that promised discovery. In such a place, memories wove themselves into the fabric of the streets. Nights spent with friends beneath the rusted swings in the park, or rushing through the crowd to catch a film at the theater, a gift from the university. Yet the city held its share of sorrow, as all places must. The ponds, their surfaces mirrored the sky, a fitting stage for reflection or midnight tears. In the midst of an existential dread, I found myself there often. Watching the turtles and ducks and insects, each carrying out its simple purpose, I questioned my own. I wandered past the pond, through the park, past neat little houses that spoke of suburban life, until the main street opened before me. The sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I looked up, I saw the north stretched before me. There they were, as they had always been. The mountains, steadfast and eternal, brushed against the blue and yellow heavens, towering over all. In their silent majesty, they stirred within me a sense of resolve, a whisper of endurance that would not be silenced.",
            "You might pass it by without a second look. A place that doesn't catch the eye, hidden in the folds of a quiet town, tucked behind the tired facades of a shopping strip. The kind of place that seems unlikely for living, where folks wouldn't choose to settle. And yet, beyond the husk of an old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty but for the once-a-year gatherings of kin in summer's warm embrace, lies a community alive and unsung. Streets lined with apartments, each complex a part of a larger whole, like Russian dolls that have been meticulously laid out side by side, their secrets whispered to those who know where to listen. The first set of apartments has seen its share of scandal, tales told in hushed voices, tales that paint a picture darker than the truth. But beyond, a different world breathes, unknown to the many who dwell in these parts. Across from these sentinels of life stands the quiet campus of a community college, its buildings watching over the road. Students shuffle in with steaming cups as day breaks, their eyes heavy with the promise of knowledge, while the iron gates groan in welcome. Commuters scowl from their cars, impatient with the slow procession of those seeking enlightenment. The road splits then, one path leading to a park where laughter echoes, and the other to a place of healing, where broken bodies mend. The center speaks of comfort, with its inviting porches and whispering fans that stir the heavy air. Children race across the park, their limbs a blur of joy among the tall grass, bees dancing lazily in the blossoms. Elderly folks walk their dogs, casting disapproving glances at the youth who skate with abandon, while clusters of girls share secrets by the swings. Nearby, a strip mall offers its own quiet tales. A sushi joint with fare that's good but seldom sought, a shop selling summer's promise in swimming gear, and a salon where nails find their gloss. Here, one could linger, juggling life's small pleasures—a pool's cool embrace, a touch of polish, a plate of hibachi. Even a place to find frozen delight, sweet and cold in the hands of teens who ride the edge of recklessness under the southern sun. This neighborhood, a small reflection of the nation's heart, a snapshot of the enduring South where time slips by like the gentle flow of a river, unchanged and unchanging.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawling under the wide and open sky, the houses lined up like quiet sentinels of a bygone dream. Most were homes for single families, yet some had been cleaved in two, standing side by side as if unsure of their own symmetry. My own stood with its small yard and its slender driveway, a relic of an era when the suburbs whispered promises of the American dream. Once, this dream embraced the land and its people, but now it drifts like smoke. Still, the neighborhood endures, its voice a distant echo of hope, speaking to those who wander its streets that the dream holds on by a thread.\n\nThe folks here, their optimism has faded like the paint on the picket fences, the yards not tended as they once were. Yet cars remain parked in driveways, and the children play in the streets as if the world they knew was the only world that mattered. The old schoolhouse, nearly ninety years in its standing, breathes life into the young and churns up memories for the old. Churches are sparse, mostly hollowed out, yet the courts are alive with the sound of leather against pavement.\n\nEach home wears a different face, yet they share a common soul. There is the supermarket called Super \"A,\" its aisles watched over by a Yemeni family, perhaps the sole Arab presence in these parts. Most here are African American, their roots deep in the earth of this place. The streets are wide, and the children's games pause only for the passing of cars. Many families have been here for generations, their stories woven into the fabric of the past where all knew each other by name.\n\nThere was a karate school once, but Hollywood turned away from such dreams, and now it is a pharmacy, for some say pills soothe where dreams cannot. A small theater still stands, offering old films at a price that draws the elders but leaves the young unmoved. An expressway cuts through the town, its exits beyond our borders. Once, there was a clamor for an exit here, the young in favor, the old against. They said it would spoil the town, and in the end, the city council listened to their quiet wisdom.\n\nThey're raising a new high school now, and we ponder a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin might just capture the heart of this place.",
            "The city sprawls in its vastness, a tapestry of lives interwoven yet distinct. Here, where the streets wind erratically among towers of commerce, life unfolds in a patchwork of humanity. Offices stand in rows like sentinels, their windows darkened by the shadows of monoliths. Shops and eateries abound, each a world unto itself, drawing wanderers in with the promise of sustenance or some fleeting escape. Grand emporiums of renown mark the landscape, countered by humble boutiques that cling to the city's cobbled arteries. The avenues, lined with these varied establishments, pulse with the footfalls of those who dwell within neighborhoods meant for quietude yet touched by the ever-present hum of urban life.\n\nParks, mere patches of green amidst the concrete sea, offer respite to those seeking solace beneath their boughs. Children play, their laughter echoing the innocence of days unspoiled. In this place, diversity is not a claim but a living truth. The streets tell tales of those who came from lands afar—their languages a symphony, their customs a tapestry. Here, the LGBTQ+ community finds its voice alongside the devout chants of the Orthodox, and the stories of those who fled the shadow of the Soviet Union unfold with each step taken.\n\nBeyond these streets, the city stretches further, a mosaic of enclaves each with its own identity. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—names that speak of heritage and belonging, yet the journey to each is fraught with the trials of traffic that binds the city in its relentless grip. Miles pass slowly beneath the wheels, the hours marked by the stagnant crawl of vehicles in endless procession. The irony of a city so vast is its constriction, for though the distances may be short, the passage is long and wearying.\n\nYet, they come still. The cranes rise, and new towers reach for the heavens as if the earth itself might yield more space. The city draws them in, but not without dissent. For with each new soul, the roads grow fuller, the spaces tighter. Those who have called this place home watch the change with wary eyes.\n\nIn this labyrinth, homes take many forms. Towers of glass and steel stand alongside modest dwellings, each a sanctuary for its inhabitants. Some find solace in the singular embrace of family homes, while others share walls in duplexes. The streets of my own neighborhood, a microcosm of the city itself, reveal a myriad of domiciles, each sheltering lives as varied as the cityscape. Yet, in this place of infinite variety, familiarity is a rare currency. The faces of neighbors slip by like shadows, unknown and unknowing, save for the echoes of childhood laughter that linger in the memory of games once played in the fading light of simpler days.",
            "The road stretched out through the fields of corn, endless and vast, where the horizon seemed to hold the very sky. She peered out, eyes wide, the silence of the land standing in stark contrast to the world she knew, where the grocery store was a mere stroll from her door. But here, there was only the earth, boundless and unbroken, and I told her of my Ohio, of my youth in a place where land was the measure of a man. Down the narrow road, past the quarry brimming with water that mirrored the heavens, lay the small gathering of homes where I lived. Each house, a fortress of brick and stucco, staked its claim on the earth, a half-acre of pride in every yard. In spring, the gardens burst forth, a riot of flowers beneath the weathered limbs of trees that marked the seasons with their changing hues.\n\nThe driveways shimmered with the polish of fine Mercedes, a gleam in the sun that spoke of care and labor. As I neared my gray stucco home, there was my neighbor, the Korean, always with a song on his lips and the mower's drone beneath his voice. He was a man whose years had taken some of his sharpness, yet his heart was ever true. Once a healer, now he tended his grass as diligently as he once did his patients, becoming one with the earth and his John Deere.\n\nWhen you arrive at my home, the geese are there, bold amid the grass, and our Terrier, ever the hunter, gives chase. Beyond, a stream weaves through the land, a quiet melody against the distant calls of cows. Across the bridge of wood, crafted by hand, lies a sanctuary untouched by time, where trees and wildflowers grow as they will. Here was the cradle of my childhood, a realm of forts and pursuits, where imagination ran as wild as the creatures we chased.\n\nWinter came with its own harsh beauty, casting the land in white, the living world turned to stillness. The trees stood bare, sentinels in a frozen expanse, yet when snow graced the ground, it became a canvas for angels and snowmen, the work of my sister's hands. We were warriors in those days, snowballs our weapons, forts of snow and branch our bastions. There, in our winter kingdom, we found the freedom of children, untouched by the world beyond."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the quiet heart of rural America, in a small town in Michigan where the land shifts from sprawling farmland to quaint tourist enclaves, there are no sprawling city malls or chains of commerce like Wal-Mart or Target or even an Applebee's. Here, journeys are measured in miles, and the roads lead you through a landscape kissed by water's edge. The town, my place in this world, is held in the embrace of water. To one side the vastness of Lake Michigan, to the other, the more intimate Lake Charlevoix, each offering their beaches where one might wade in the cool embrace of the waves.\n\nThe neighborhood here speaks of small-town life, where houses breathe with space, not stacked like bricks in a wall but standing alone, each with its own story. They are not the uniform creations of modern times but homes of another era, some renewed, others holding the patina of years. These homes stand with basements that show their faces to the road, and many are clad in the old armor of aluminum siding, their colors as varied as the leaves in autumn. Yards spread out before them, dotted with trampolines and playsets, gardens where the earth yields its bounty, and fences that hold back the creatures of the household.\n\nThis place is Middle America, where the people work by the sweat of their brows, raising families or having seen their children grow and leave. The streets are alive with the laughter of children, the rhythmic slap of dog paws, the hum of bicycles and the whisper of rollerblades. Neighbors nod to neighbors, and the strangers are known by the absence of recognition. A wave to a man at the grill, a smile to the woman walking a dog from far down the block. The lawns are neat, the grass clipped and green, leaves not left to gather and rot. It is not a neighborhood that dazzles with its beauty, but one that comforts with its promise—a place where families are raised in the quiet certainty of peace, a sanctuary at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s station stands watch, the health department close by, the city’s recycling center a stone’s throw away, all serving the people here. The fields of baseball and softball echo with the announcer’s calls, the small town airport abuzz with the drone of engines as small planes rise and fall in the sky. An ice cream shop beckons within a stroll, and the downtown’s heart can be reached by foot from this circle of homes. My children ride their bikes to a park not far off, a mere eight blocks away. It is a good place, a fine place to call home.",
            "The land where I find myself is a place of sameness, a tract of earth where houses stand in neat rows like soldiers at attention, each one a mirror to the next. Here the hand of the homeowner’s association is felt keen and sharp, shaping the world to its will. The lawns are clipped and tidy, a green uniformity broken only by stones set in patterns and the occasional tree, stunted and solitary. In the driveways, cars sit in pairs, sheltered beneath the roofs of twin garages. The streets themselves are smooth as glass, unmarred by the scars of time or neglect. No cracks, no holes. Just the unbroken sweep of new-laid concrete.\n\nThe houses rise mostly in single story, though here and there a second floor reaches skyward, an anomaly amid the conformity. There are no mailboxes before each door. Instead, at the street’s end, a cluster of metal boxes waits, keys in hand, to unlock the letters and packages within. The HOA has seen to this, their desire for order manifest in little things.\n\nWe stand at the city's edge, this place neither fully rural nor wholly suburban, but a blending of both. The land spreads wide and open, with room enough for pools where the water shivers under the sun, and trails that wind through the quiet, waiting for the feet of those who walk alone or with a dog at heel. The old come here to rest, their days measured in the slow drift of time. The young are fewer, but they are here too, mingling with their elders.\n\nThe city beyond is a contradiction, vast in its number but small in its heart. It has all that one might need, though never too much. A mall stands solitary, humble in its offerings, yet enough to serve. To reach the stores and the life of the city takes but a short drive, and once there, all the world unfolds. The rich foods and the cheap, the grand shops and the small. It is a place where needs are met, and yet, this is a world that asks nothing more than to be as it is. Safe and kept, a piece of the whole, and nothing more.",
            "The first I heard tell of the place was from a voice on a podcast, recounting tales of souls who had vanished into the ether. It took me by surprise. Here was a world where each apartment fetched over a thousand dollars a month and yet this story was unknown to me and mine. Perhaps it is the struggle. I know friends who lay awake in the night, eyes wet with tears. Life is dear, but we have learned to scrape by, finding beauty in the dust of flea market toys and clothes long packed away. The scent of adulthood is like a dusty magazine stacked upon a forgotten piano. It seeps into the leather and lingers long after the washing is done. Here, within a stone’s throw, lie three thrift stores. If you begin at one end, you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a hive, cars and people thronging the streets with the dawn, yet within the thrift stores, silence reigns. No matter how many souls pass by, the quiet holds. It’s a fine spot to while away the hours. Each year, the flood of cars and people grows. They call it a city in bloom, headquarters to one of the great online empires. It bears the scars of its growth still. It recalls New York to mind. Each person, each thing, pursues its own end, and not much is asked of you. You can keep to yourself, be still and silent, and folks will let you be. Unlike the South, where a touch of concern shows care, here lives go unexamined. You can maintain your shell as long as you wish, and the city will rise and fall like waves upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound. Between the pianist next door and the singers above, there’s always a tune in the air. In a fashion, we are less strangers in apartments and more a circle of friends. We gather for our needs, mark the passing of years, grieve and celebrate together, and lend a hand when we can. I count myself fortunate to be here. My neighbors are a good sort, and they treat me kindly. I keep the place tidy, share what I can, and they return the favor. We exchange letters and visits. It’s a simple pleasure, seeing them, and I believe they find some joy in my company as well. I dwell in this vast, impersonal expanse of modernity, yet it is the likes of my neighbors who make me feel perhaps I have not squandered my days entirely.",
            "In a small town perched on the edge of the city’s sprawl, where the east wind carries whispers of better times, I dwell. This place, neither forgotten nor entirely remembered, lies where the suburbs end and the earth begins to reclaim its own. The east side, where I make my home, is a patchwork of weary houses. Their paint long since faded, homes to souls who wrestle with an invisible hand that keeps their dreams tethered low to the ground. Yet the people are not without their grace. Faces that greet you with the warmth of a weary sun, nodding as you pass, their smiles worn but sincere. \n\nHere, the specter of crime lurks in the shadows, a part of the place like wind through the empty branches, though it seldom shows its face. In the decade past, violence has struck like sudden summer storms, leaving behind a silence more profound than before. Last year, the family next door lost their boy to a gunshot, a life ended outside the dim glow of a tavern’s neon promise. Our own steps have been lighter, with only the occasional loss of small things left too long on the porch, a reminder of the precarious peace we hold.\n\nThis town bears the scars of the opioid plague, a tragedy too great to be borne in silence. Lives extinguished by the quiet poison of fentanyl, their absence felt in the spaces they no longer fill. Yet in this darkness, there is light. Places of healing, where the lost might find their way back, and hands reaching out with the knowledge of Narcan, offering a lifeline where hope had faltered.\n\nIn the midst of these tribulations, the town holds fast to its virtues. My son’s school, a haven of laughter and learning, where kindness is the currency and differences are celebrated rather than scorned. The staff, from the principal's steady hand to the teachers’ guiding voices, create a world where he feels safe, loved. Events weave the families together, a tapestry of community and connection, each thread stronger for its neighbor.\n\nThough the weight of poverty hangs heavy, no child is left to hunger. The school ensures every one eats, breaking bread with dignity, the meals a daily act of grace. The burdens of fees and trips are lightened, allowing each child to walk unencumbered by want. The City Council, in their wisdom, has breathed new life into the heart of the town. Roads smooth as river stones, parks where laughter echoes, though the east side remains a landscape of neglect, its needs overshadowed by the commerce-driven west.\n\nYet I find solace here. The faces familiar, the kindnesses small but genuine. The shops sufficient to clothe and feed us, the house a haven, humble but ours. Sixteen years have passed in this place, our roots entwined with the earth beneath. We cannot imagine another land, another home. This town, flawed and beautiful, is where we belong.",
            "The neighborhood lies sprawled across the hill, a place thick with stories and shadows. High above, the buildings stand, sentinels of history, with their facades etched by time. I reside in a seven-story edifice, staring out at the old theater, its presence a whisper of yesteryear's grandeur. Down the slope, a block away, sits a vibrant arcade bar where souls of all kinds gather like moths to a flame on those balmy summer eves. When June turns to July, the line stretches long and winding, a testament to the life that pulses here. The park, a stone’s throw north, sprawls wide, a hidden oasis amidst the city's concrete heart. In winter’s chill, the homeless find solace, raising their tents in ordered lines upon the pavement and steps. The snow seldom falls, but the rain, it comes in sheets, a relentless curtain that chills to the bone. They huddle close, seeking warmth in the city's core, near the family center where they might wash away the cold.\n\nYet it is not the buildings nor the bygone elegance that holds my heart. It is the people, the culture, alive in every face and every corner. Hilltop, once notorious, carries the weight of its past in stories whispered through alleys and across generations. They speak of a time when the government swept through, a storm trying to cleanse the streets. The people remember, and they pass these tales on, even to newcomers like me. Though the streets still bear the scars, the community strives to keep them clean, to hold onto hope. They say if your skin is pale, the night is not yours in Hilltop. But this warning is a ghost, an echo of old fears. Perhaps I am dark enough to blend, or maybe I am simply a child of Hilltop, aware of the shadows that linger, the reminders of a world not yet healed. Here, racism and fear still weave their threads, even in this supposed melting pot.\n\nYet no matter where I wander, Hilltop calls to me. The night streets are alive, and in them, I find my place. The people are kind, offering warmth instead of harm. The laundromat stays open for me to find shelter from the storm. And on the bleakest nights, when I imagine myself unseen, someone will pause, look into my eyes, press a bill into my hand, and remind me of my worth. In this place, I am home.",
            "I came to this place when the world was just opening up to me at the start of eighth grade. There was a solitude in those first days, a quiet unfamiliarity that lingered like a shadow, but soon the silence gave way to voices and the faces of friends. There were two of them, living near as the crow flies, their laughter and stories becoming a part of the air I breathed. They've since gone on to other places, yet their presence remains etched in the corners of memory. The people who greeted me at the outset are still here, their lives woven into the fabric of this suburban expanse.\n\nThe neighborhood sprawls like a tapestry of two-story homes. On weekends, when the sun warms the earth, the voices of children rise up, a chorus of innocence carried on the breeze. The weekdays whisper a different music, one of stillness and the quiet hum of life passing by. Here, in this enclave, troubles are few, and solitude is a choice, not a sentence. Packages left on doorsteps remain untouched, a testament to a trust that binds one neighbor to the next.\n\nA stone's throw from my door lies a park, a realm of recollections. It's a place where the echoes of basketballs and footballs linger, where victories and defeats played out beneath the wide sky. It holds both laughter and pain, like the time a misstep left me with a bloody nose. Yet even that memory, sharp as it was, is softened by the warmth of so many afternoons spent in the company of friends. Now, the park is a domain I share with my cousin's children, their joy tangible as they swing and slide, the world a wonder to their eyes.\n\nThis neighborhood speaks in many tongues, its diversity a testament to the life it holds. Within a short stretch of road, the scents of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian kitchens mingle, though many now turn to the convenience of meals brought to their door by unseen hands. Fast food joints, ubiquitous in their presence, share the streets with pizza parlors, each offering a slice of familiarity. The stores, varied and plentiful, stand ready to meet every need. A Walgreens and a CVS stand sentinel on the main thoroughfare, alongside a Jewel-Osco, the Midwest's contribution to the grocery world. Even the stores reflect the neighborhood's mosaic, as an Indian-owned shop offers both homemade and ready-made flavors from afar.\n\nIn this place, I find a quiet contentment. The stories of others, their neighborhoods filled with strife and discord, serve as a reminder of the peace I have found here. For that, I am grateful.",
            "In the shadow of the college where I study lies the neighborhood I call home, a place stitched together by apartment blocks and the occasional haunt where one might find a drink or a meal without emptying their pockets. There's a bar, newly christened, where the prices climb higher but the spirits and service remain as ever they were, not the worst a man might find. The folk here are mostly students or those of lesser means, drawn by the modest rents that beckon from the buildings, old as they may seem from without, their hearts perhaps renewed. Children spill from the nearby school, their laughter carried on the wind, and though I see my neighbors, I know them not nor wish to, their habits of smoke and weed a jest to my boyfriend and I, what with the management’s crude attempt at masking the scent with air fresheners. \n\nDown the way stand new apartments, shiny and false, their very walls a testament to haste and thrift, yet they demand a king's ransom for rent. A scam it seems, yet they thrive on their proximity to campus, luring tenants with their glittering facade. There's a place, not five minutes on foot, where food comes on paper plates and the microwave hums its sad tune, a testament to cheap sustenance. Across lies a gas station, whispered about in tones that speak of hardship. But the summer past brought change to the road, a gift from the city that laid down wide sidewalks and green medians, a touch of grace upon the land, though my building stands ensconced in trees, a grove that holds the world at bay. Not all survived the culling, for stumps stand sentinel, reminders of what was, yet still the trees outnumber those down the street. \n\nBeyond my home, another street runs, 43rd, its visage less kind. The sidewalks crumble and the buildings wear their age like a shroud. Here are trees too, perhaps to cloak the decay. Crime finds purchase in the complex down the street, but it’s not the only one to blame. Across from me, another den of transience, where people come and go like the turning of a page. Yet I find solace where I am, for it is within my means, and the conveniences gather around me like old friends. The university is but a short walk, and two bus stops stand ready to carry me to the store or to the heart of the city with ease.",
            "The street runs in a circle, a cul-de-sac where duplexes stand like solitary sentinels, their facades washed in the same sunbaked yellow. Each wears a white porch like a collar and a green metal roof that gleams under the sky's indifferent blue gaze. These are not just houses but homes, tethered by the thin thread of friendly discourse, neighbors gathering at the cusp of driveways to share words as the sun dips low, their children painting the world with chalk or chasing the wind with kites. It is a place out of time, where the mechanical hum of modernity seems but a distant echo.\n\nFields and trees shoulder the neighborhood, standing sentinel beneath the vast sky where clouds billow like sails on a forgotten sea. Yet there is a darkness that looms. This season the air is thick with the promise of storms, sirens wailing their ghostly warning. Last night the sound came, a siren's keen lament, and we sought the refuge of our shelters. I sat in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my large dog paced the living room, restless as the storm itself. The world outside was silent but for the hail's ferocious tattoo upon the earth. \n\nWhen at last the storm relented, the road exhaled steam, a ghostly breath from the sudden shift in temperature. The heat refused to yield, and the hail melted upon the pavement's embrace. Above, the sky began to clear, and the sun's fingers reached down through the rain, painting a double rainbow upon the canvas of the heavens. I ran for my camera, capturing the fleeting wonder to share with those distant through the cold glass screen. They marveled, and so did I. \n\nThe quiet held the streets in its arms for a time, until the world awoke and life returned, mothers calling their children in as dinner simmered. It is a place of kindness, this new home of mine, far from where I once stood in New Hampshire. The southern drawl wraps around words like a warm shawl. I reside in a two-bedroom place, as do all here, though within each the space changes, some rooms shrinking into themselves. It is a mystery. \n\nBehind my dwelling, a great field stretches out, a green expanse leading to a pond that forbids the caress of swimmers. Deer wander there, and in the morning the bullfrog's song rises like a hymn. It is a good place to live, a mere forty minutes from the city's pulse. The dawn is heralded by roosters crowing from nearby farms, a call to a new day. A donkey brays in the evening, reminding us all of our place in this small village-like world. I have found a jewel in this place, a sanctuary in the southern soil.",
            "In the long years since I first set foot here, the years that have come and gone like pages blown across a field, I reckon I’ve learned a thing or two. I recall the sorrow that took hold of me when we left Riverdale. The tears I shed as we departed for Stockbridge, a place unknown and unwelcome then. But my folks wanted better, always better, for me and my sister. The houses were finer, the schools were finer. They said it wasn’t ghetto and that was reason enough. In time, I made peace with it, found friends and foes in equal measure at the school. The neighbors, they mostly stayed strangers, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, Dennis too, living right beside us. They've been a lot like family in their own ways and I hold them dear. I remember the day we all went to Mr. Glen’s wedding, him and Ms. Veda tying the knot anew. A day of joy and laughter, a glimpse of what I hope to find as I lay stones on my own path, dreaming of a life fit for a queen. When Ms. Veda tossed that little white garter, it was me who caught it, though the flowers slipped through my fingers. We danced till the stars wore thin, Marsharii and me. Haven’t seen her since. Hope she's found her own way. The neighborhood, it’s a tangle of streets and turns, though these days I’ve got a GPS to guide me. I’ve wandered a bit, mostly with Kason and Curtis, my companions in the art of idling. We played our games, lived our lives with a fervor only youth can muster. Sometimes I’d find my way to the park, seeking the solace only nature bestows. There’s a peace in it, a calm. I’d bring my sticks from the depot, honing balance, wielding my wooden sword against the unseen foes of the world. There’s a court for basketball and tennis, long abandoned by me but there still, waiting should the urge to play return. My father, he taught us tennis alongside Mr. Graves. We sweated and laughed under the sun’s watchful eye. There’s stories aplenty, tales of joy and hardship woven into the fabric of this place. And yet, I feel the best is still to come, waiting just beyond the horizon.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town unassuming in its quietude, a place where the world seems to slow and the dust settles gently on the roadways. Johnston, they call it, a name that whispers through the fields of peach and cattle. Claiming its fame as the Peach Capital of the World, its sign stands with a pride that belies its simplicity, welcoming all who wander through its borders. The land is vast and open, a patchwork of farms and fields, where the earth yields its bounty under the relentless sun. The houses, when they appear, sit back from the road, nestled in the embrace of their own expanse, roofs of metal or shingle guarding against the summer's wrath. \n\nIn the heart of the town, a lone stoplight marks the crossroad, casting its red and green upon the handful of stores that stand resolute. A Chinese place called Hong Kong, a fiesta of Mexican fare, and Gary's burgers offer their fast relief to weary travelers. Once, there was a pizzeria, but its doors have long since closed, leaving behind only the memory of its warmth. A pharmacy named Maxwell and Halford Drug persists, known not for its remedies but for the cherry cola that flows sweet and sticky from its coolers. The IGA stands as the sole purveyor of groceries, though its aisles see fewer feet, as many choose the journey to Walmart in distant Batesburg-Leesville.\n\nYet, it is Dollar General that draws the town's life to it, a marketplace of necessity where the rhythm of commerce beats steady from dawn till dusk. Nearby, a furniture store, Possibilities, remains a testament to endurance, its owner a fixture in the tapestry of Johnston's people. And beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a sanctuary for creatures great and small, offers its gentle care.\n\nThe town's edges hold a doctor’s office and a veterinary practice, small sanctuaries of healing for the folks who call this place home. The children gather at Johnston Elementary, their laughter and learning confined until the fifth grade, whereupon they must journey to a neighboring town for further schooling. No parks grace this land yet, though plans unfurl for a modest stretch of recreation to bring life to its soil.\n\nThere is little to occupy one's time here, no theaters or lanes for bowling, no places for idle gatherings, yet the town holds its charm in the whispers of its streets and the stories of its soil. It is a place so small you might pass it by, a mere blink and gone, yet within its bounds lies a world entire, quiet and enduring.",
            "In the heart of a small southern town in Tennessee, I find myself settled in a suburb like many others. The street runs between two state highways, and it draws more traffic than one might care for, but beyond that, the neighborhood rests in a kind of quietude. Folks around here don't come and go much, and so the faces remain familiar, each etched into the landscape like the trees that stand sentinel over us. Busy with their yards and the daily grind of living, they pass the seasons in simple labors. Winter sees children sledding down the hill by the side street, their laughter carried on the cold air. Our house sits at the front corner, and from there, we watch the world slide by, noting the cars, the strangers among them, a measure of vigilance we all keep. Neighbors walk their dogs or themselves, and children roam on bikes as if tethered to the past.\n\nOur days revolve around this place, home in more ways than one, for work ties us to its walls. Four of us fill its rooms—myself, my wife, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen. We weave ourselves into the fabric of this street, coming and going as thread through a loom. Sometimes, we spill out into the rain, oblivious to its chill, and the grill on the back deck sends sweet smoke into the world, a scent that blends with the incessant hum of lawnmowers from March till October when the grass gives up its growth. The trees here are plentiful, remnants of the forest that once was, and they cast their shadows long. But come fall, they shed their leaves, and we rake them into piles to burn. The scent of burning leaves is a harbinger of the season, a reminder that fall has taken hold.\n\nThe winters of late do not bite as they once did, leaving autumn to linger in their stead. Our garage, tucked at the back of the house, sees more use than the front door. It's there I work on my truck or tinker with whatever project calls to me, the open doors a window into the life that unfolds beyond. Holidays bring a hush over the street, except for the swell of cars when families gather from afar. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas, each marks its time with the arrival of visitors. In all of it, there is a sense of belonging, and though the road runs through, it feels like home enough. If only it were a road that ended, it might be perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where the earth sprawls in the eternal embrace of dust and sand, my neighborhood rests in a quiet defiance against time. The land is a tapestry of brown, a hue that stretches to the horizons, and only those who call this place home truly grasp the omnipresence of this color. Green lawns are a rarity, a testament to fortunes spent on coaxing life from the arid soil. Back in the nineties, the houses lay scattered like seeds sown by a wandering hand, and though the years have passed, the earth remains much the same, albeit dotted now with new constructions rising like stubborn monuments. This place, it grows more akin to a city with each passing day, a fate shared by many lands in this changing world. \n\nThe folk here, they carry the warmth of the desert sun, mostly kind, though like any city, shadows linger in corners. My own street harbors the elderly, gentle souls who mark this as a place of neighborly grace. The stores are those of chains, familiar names like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For finer fare, one must journey afar; Whole Foods and such are strangers in these parts. The work that draws men here is the building of things, for this city is yet unfinished, vast spaces waiting to be claimed by the hands of men. It holds a certain dread for me, this march of progress, for I fled the clamor of a great city and have no wish to return. \n\nConstruction is my trade, the art of drywall and T-bar, and in this craft, I find my daily bread. Yet what endears this place to me, beyond the toil, is the life that thrives despite the harshness. The desert is a canvas painted with creatures that dart and scuttle, a wonderland for my children who chase lizards and beetles under the unyielding sun. High desert climes forge ecosystems both fragile and fierce, demanding respect from those who dwell here. We, my kin and I, have learned to live in harmony with these wild neighbors. \n\nIn our town, attractions are few but cherished. Victorville, it stands as a gateway to the desert's embrace, offering families a taste of its rugged beauty. The annual San Bernardino County Fair breathes life into our days, a carnival of joy and simple pleasures. Beyond, the mountains of Wrightwood beckon, their snow-clad peaks a siren's call to those seeking winter's touch. For those drawn to the stories of earth and man, the Victor Valley Museum holds tales of stone and bone, of the people who carved their lives into this unforgiving land.\n\nThus, in this arid cradle, life persists, a testament to resilience, and in its quiet persistence, I find a certain peace.",
            "In the waking hours when the light is yet faint and the world trembles on the brink of another day’s unfolding, I reckon my neighborhood in a way perhaps less common, less known. Others might speak of tidy houses in a row, each with its own tale and hearth, but mine is a sprawl of academic halls and dormitories, the college grounds my own peculiar province. The people who dwell here, they form the heart of my community, though beyond the brick and mortar they too stretch, like the branches of some ancient tree, into the wider campus, which serves as my neighborhood in its own wild and unyielding way. \n\nIt is the same and yet not the same as the neighborhoods of old with their quiet streets and corner stores. Here too are places of dwelling, people moving like shadows across the green, stores with their wares, and parks with their solemn retreat. Let me lay before you the dwellings that mark this place. There are three kinds as I know them: apartments, houses, and the dormitory halls. \n\nThe apartments, they stack and rise like books upon a shelf, each room holding two to four souls, and floors numbering two, maybe more. Twenty souls or so gather in such a space, living, breathing, learning. Then there are the houses, a rare thing, scattered like seeds among the grounds, filled often with alumni, those who once were and now remain tied to the school’s embrace. \n\nBut most common are the dormitories, vast and teeming, where hundreds lay their heads, sharing rooms, sharing lives, in a community that pulses and shifts like the tide. \n\nIn this place, diversity is the law, as unyielding as gravity. Faces from all corners of the earth find themselves here, drawn to this place of learning. The staff find refuge in houses, the young ones in dormitories, and the elder students, wiser perhaps, in the apartments. \n\nThe people defy description, each a world unto themselves, and so let us speak instead of the stores and parks. This college, this self-contained universe, holds within it all manner of stores, from those that feed the body to those that clothe it, unique in their offerings yet familiar, the scent of academia upon them. \n\nAnd the park, a refuge amidst the stone and glass, is a gathering place for the diverse souls, a sanctuary kept safe by the hands of the community, clean and free from the shadows that plague the world beyond. \n\nIn this place, everything needed lies within reach, the boundaries of the neighborhood holding all things fast, as if in the embrace of a world entire.",
            "In the place where I live sidewalks are a rarity. All things seem to flow downward, cresting at the house at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill. Joggers test their mettle against its incline, running up the narrow road where the pavement bears the scars of time and weather. Pits and ruts that make for treacherous driving. The telephone and electric wires drape from pole to pole, tattered and forlorn. Storms rage in this country, and the wind and the rain bring down branches that strike at the lines. Repairs leave them a patchwork shamble. Tall evergreens rise everywhere about, though folks here despise them. They cut them down to clear the view of the ocean, building their homes high atop the hill with great glass walls to drink in the vista of the bay. At sunset, when the light beneath the waves ignites and the sky burns orange, it is a beauty that wounds the soul. Yet more often than not clouds hang low, and the sun's rays come filtered through a haze. Days are damp and overcast, and moss creeps over every surface it can claim: roofs and cars and railings alike. I left my car in the drive for a month and when I returned it was green and furred with moss, and it took hours to scrape it clean.  \n\nChildren are few in these parts, despite the school not far off. The neighbors are mostly older, retired, their lawns populated by dogs in place of offspring. The dogs roam free, racing down the street, and if a door or window is left ajar they may slip inside. I found one in the living room once, had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits run wild, too, and some grow large, digging up the roots of plants, burrowing into lawns, much to the gardeners' dismay. My cats hunt them with a vengeance, driving them from our vicinity. Birds flit about, sparrows and hummingbirds, with the hawks and eagles sometimes swooping low until the crows rise to chase them off.  \n\nThere's no store nearby, but if you head down the hill toward the waterfront, you'll find a handful of restaurants serving fresh catch. The beach is scant, more rock than sand, but the stones make for good throwing into the bay, which is not wide. Even through the mist you can see the far shore, a line across the water, constant and unyielding.",
            "In the sprawling cityscape of New York, there's a place called Bensonhurst. It's not hard to find, not with public transportation weaving through like sinews in a great beast. This urban enclave holds all the chaos and vibrancy of the city itself. Walk the streets and you'll meet the eyes of the Asian storefronts, a testament to the waves of souls who came seeking something on these shores. Two decades of change have painted the neighborhood in new colors, the lines of its face altered yet familiar.\n\nThe markets and laundromats—they stand sentinel on each block, their doors open to the world. The food is good, the prices fair, and convenience reigns supreme in this corner of the city. In a stretch no longer than a child's laughter, four supermarkets cater to the needs of the people. This is Bensonhurst, diverse in its bones and sinews, with generations of immigrants mingling among the streets. The businesses, large and small, ripple with the influence of their Asian proprietors, shaping the rhythm of daily life.\n\nThere's a park nearby, where the city's children run free. Ten basketball courts, fields wide enough for the dreams of soccer and baseball, handball walls to echo the slap of a ball. Swings and a playground offer respite, and in the heat of summer, a fountain becomes a haven. Here, the fabric of humanity is as varied as the city itself, each stitch a different hue.\n\nBuildings rise here and there, co-ops and condos, but mostly it's the houses, two families to a plot, that hold the stories of the people. The air is alive with sound, music blaring from cars, engines roaring in the dawn. It's a noisy place, but the noise is life. Yet, when night falls, you must tread carefully. The streets can turn on you, and in their shadows lurk the unpredictable. Memories of assaults long past and packages pilfered from doorsteps linger like ghosts.\n\nThe city's rules are a whisper against the wind. Fines for unheeded norms, for the mess left by dogs on their morning rounds. You walk, eyes cast downward, wary of where you place your feet. It's the smallest things that can unsettle you, the little grievances that gnaw at the edges of your peace. In Bensonhurst, as in all places, you find the good and the less so, side by side, as the city goes on, ever living, ever changing.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, there's a thread you must grasp to understand its soul, and that thread is called \"weird.\" Painted bold on the backside of a building—a place that wears many masks as a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, and skirts the edges of the law—is the town's unofficial creed: \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, it echoes a lament for the Portland of yesteryears, the nineties and early two-thousands, a city less known, less burdened by cost, a crucible of creativity and subcultures. For others, it's a siren call—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is not a slur but a badge of honor. Even as the city swells with newcomers from California, the skyline crammed with condominiums to house them, Portland remains steadfastly weird. Yet, weird does not always embrace; it simply lets things be that which they usually are not. It does not mean we shun modernity or the battles it brings. Like the rest of the land, we import our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to flout the norm, yet Portland is no stranger to the mundane. It's a city of yoga and hipsters and suited professionals. Perhaps to be weird here is to carry it all with a lighter heart. My neighborhood, like many, is a tapestry of painted houses and gardens that spill over with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, where free boxes sprout like wildflowers in the summer. These boxes, humble cardboard or plastic, offer up their contents to the wanderer—a gift, a treasure meant for the one who finds it. They hold clothes and books, sometimes more, sometimes less, but always a promise of serendipity. This is the magic of walking through a Southeast Portland street—that is, what it means to me, though I am but one shade in a spectrum of weird. Among us, some would never stoop to pick their clothes from a sidewalk box. They seek their strangeness in goat yoga or the roaring stands of Timbers matches. Portland is a haven for those who love their passions fiercely, whether they chase dreams or find them at the bottom of a glass in a dim-lit bar. Yes, we have our demons. Drugs seep through the city like rain through the gutters, their root often in the mind's shadows, fed by the endless rain and the gray sky's weight. Homelessness is a specter that haunts us, a puzzle with no easy answer. Our city's hands stretch out with services, better than most, yet never enough, like elsewhere. Between care and disdain, we sway, and in this we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stood eternal in their northern fastness, bearing witness to the sun's rites at every dawn and dusk, indifferent to the stirrings of man or the petty tides of his days. They watched, unblinking, as I moved through the world below, their presence a constant, immutable truth. In times of turmoil, when life pressed upon me with its myriad demands, they summoned my gaze, demanding to be seen, offering a moment's respite to my restless soul. It was here I came as a young scholar, drawn to the university nestled in their shadow. The mountains claimed me first, their majesty eclipsing the allure of the stately buildings and tranquil ponds of the campus. The town, too, held its charms, a tapestry of quaint cafés where many a night was spent in caffeine-induced study. A short journey brought one to the heart of the town, where the faded bricks of old buildings whispered of a history rich and enduring. Here, the town pulsed with the vigor of life, a brief mimicry of the bustling city nearby, yet all too soon it yielded back to the quietude of its suburban soul. This dance of contrasts, the city's restless energy and the town's serene quietude, invited exploration and the weaving of memories. There were nights spent wandering, laughter echoing past rusty swings, or racing through the vibrant streets to catch a show, the tickets a gift from the university. Yet, the town also bore witness to life's harsher truths, as all places must. The ponds, especially, became a refuge for reflection or the silent tears of existential doubt in the small hours. I found myself pondering my place in the great tapestry of life, watching the turtles and ducks and insects, each playing their part. And so I walked, past the pond and park and the rows of houses steeped in suburban quiet, until I reached the main street. The sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, the sky a canvas of blue and yellow, and I realized my steps had led me northward. There they were, the mountains, steadfast and towering, grazing the sky with their ancient forms. In their silent strength, they stirred within me a will to endure.",
            "In the dim shade of a sun-baked afternoon, you might pass it by without a second thought. Just a residential area, lurking behind a tattered shopping strip, not the sort of place one would reckon folks lay their heads. Surely not the sort of place most would choose. Yet, if your feet lead you past the derelict husk of the old Whole Foods and beyond the weary hotels standing empty but for those scattered summer gatherings, you'll stumble upon a hidden hive of life. Streets lined with apartment blocks, standing shoulder to shoulder, like Russian dolls meticulously disassembled and placed out in a solemn procession along the road. The first of these buildings, infamous from the news, speak of dealings best left unspoken. Appearances, they are deceptive things. Yet, in the shadow of these, the remaining complexes hold a world unknown to those who wander these parts. Across from them, the community college's satellite campus sits, a cluster of sleepy edifices, guarding the road. Students drift in with coffee clutched close, eyes heavy with the dawn, starting their days in a drowsy haze. The iron gates creak and groan, letting them in, one by one, as the commuters curse and gnash their teeth, the traffic swells and ebbs with the morning tide.  \n\nThe road ends at a crossroads, where a park sprawls on one side and a rehabilitation center, a haven for those with bones fractured by fate, stands on the other. Its porch hosts cheerful furniture, and the ceiling fan turns slow, stirring the thick summer air like a gentle hand through water. Children dart and dance across the park's grassy expanse, limbs flailing joyously among the bees that buzz 'round the flowers. Retirees walk dogs along the path, eyes narrowed at the skateboarders, nodding politely at the teenage girls, who whisper of boys and the latest YouTube idols. Nearby, a sushi joint sits in the strip mall’s embrace, serving modest fare to sparse crowds. A swimming supply store clings close beside, a nail salon nestled between. One could ready a pool, manicure nails, and feast on hibachi chicken all in one breath—the strange allure of the strip mall. A frozen yogurt place too, where teens from the park clutch chilled cups, adorned with toppings, as they skate and vape, chasing the ghost of cool. This neighborhood, a slice of Americana, a relic of the languid South where time drifts slow, like the smoke from a distant fire.",
            "The neighborhood's a place of quiet mystery, a tapestry of single-family homes interwoven with those split in twain yet bound together, a strange harmony that makes a kind of sense. Our house stands with its small yard in the fore and a narrow drive to the left, a relic of a time when the suburbs promised the American dream, that once-sweet embrace now turned away, leaving us to grasp what remains. Yet the neighborhood endures, calling out in its mute way that the dream lives still, clung to by those who wander its streets. The folk here, they've lost some of the shine in their eyes, their yards untended as once they weren't, but cars still grace the drives, and children run and shout, their games the whole of their world.\n\nThe old public school, nearing a century, stands firm, conjuring futures for the young and stirring memories in the old. Churches, sparse and echoing, stand mostly empty, but the basketball courts still resound with life. Each home bears its own face yet they echo one another, a chorus of sameness. Super \"A,\" the supermarket, is held by a Yemeni family, the sole Arabs in this place where most folk are African American. Wide streets stretch out, fields for children playing football, pausing only for passing cars.\n\nGenerations have walked these streets, tales of a time when all knew each other spoken in the quiet of porches. There was a karate school once, but as Hollywood's tales of the Karate Kid faded, so did the children's dreams, and now it's a pharmacy, for such are the times. A small theater shows old films, shunned by the young for lack of new spectacle, but cherished by elders, a bargain for a night away from the clamor.\n\nAn expressway cuts through, its exits lying beyond our reach, the youth having clamored for their own gateway, a notion the elders quashed, fearing it would mar what we have. Now a new high school rises, and in it, a choice for a mascot. I think of a cyborg with a country twang, a cabin of logs, a fitting emblem for this place of ours.",
            "In the sprawl of this city, the neighborhood winds through a tapestry of lives and places, each thread distinct yet woven into the whole. The city breathes with the cadence of its diversity, blocks lined with dwellings that stand amidst the scatter of businesses, each pursuing its own commerce under the vast indifferent sky. Here, in this labyrinth of streets, restaurants rise like sentinels offering their fare, while shops both grand and humble beckon all who wander by. The boutiques, with their small windows and whispered promises, nestle beside the giants of corporate commerce, their shadows stretching across pavements that lead to parks where parents watch their children at play, laughter echoing in the open air.\n\nThe people of this place are as varied as the city itself. Each face tells a story, and they gather in communities, each with its own pulse. Here, a vibrant LGBTQ+ community flourishes beside the solemnity of Orthodox Jewish life, and nearby, the echoes of the former Soviet Union linger in the voices of refugees and immigrants. Beyond these borders, the city stretches wide, where each district bears the stamp of those who call it home—Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—all within a stone's throw yet separated by the slow crawl of traffic that chokes the city's arteries.\n\nFew choose to walk the endless streets, for the city sprawls far and wide, and the vehicles claim the roads with their ceaseless noise. Construction cranes swing their long arms, raising new towers into the skyline, drawing more souls to this crowded land. The residents watch, some with hope, others with wary eyes, for the roads groan beneath the weight of so many, and the hunt for a place to rest one's car is a trial unto itself.\n\nYet within this chaos lies choice. There are houses and homes, spread across the city in their multitude of forms. Large apartments rise like cliffs, but for those who seek the quiet, there are smaller buildings, single-family homes, and duplexes that hold their ground against the encroaching tide. Here too, the people differ, each age and story a part of the city's fabric. But the bonds that once tied neighbor to neighbor have weakened, and the streets remember a time when children's laughter filled the air, when the games of youth bound them together in camaraderie beneath the watchful gaze of long-vanished summers.",
            "Where's everything? she said as we rolled through the endless cornfields, the horizon swallowed whole by the stalks. This is it, I told her, knowing the vastness would leave her stunned. She came from a place where the grocery store lay but a five-minute stroll away—never had she seen such open sky. Awash in the sameness of corn, I spoke of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew me and the soil from which I came. The road stretched on, a narrow country lane, till it met a quarry filled with water, and just beyond, the small settlement that was home. These houses, brick and stucco, each resting on their half-acre plots, land that folks here took pride in tending. Come spring, flowers burst forth, and trees of the Midwest donned their seasonal dress. Driveways lined with gleaming Mercedes, their chrome bright under the noonday sun after a careful wash.\n\nOnward we drove toward my gray stucco home, past my Korean neighbor with his ever-present smile. He spent his days on the mower, his song rising above its drone, a man whose humor had softened with age. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and the hum of his John Deere. The neighborhood chuckled at his antics, but he was genuine, a soul with stories to tell. At last, my home. In the side yard, geese wandered, pursued by our Terrier. Out back, a stream fed the quarry, its voice mingling with the bullfrog's call and the distant lowing of cattle.\n\nAcross the bridge I built by hand lay an untouched oasis, wild with trees and herbs and flowers never planted. Here was the ground of my childhood, building forts in the trees, chasing creatures more imagined than real. Always something to do, a neighbor child to join in play. Winters came hard in our small town, the kind that cut to the bone, but they brought a beauty all their own. The land, once green, turned stark and bare, the trees mere skeletons against the sky. Snow fell sometimes, and overnight the world transformed, a winter's dream. The backyard filled with snow angels, my sister's hand in their making, and snowmen stood sentry. We fought often as children, my sister and I, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen arms. Our forts were grand, igloos built of branches, housing our arsenal. In that frozen world, we played at life, nothing beyond our make-believe mattered. We were children, unburdened by the weight of the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the quiet heart of rural America, in a small town in Michigan where the land shifts from sprawling farmland to quaint tourist enclaves, there are no sprawling city malls or chains of commerce like Wal-Mart or Target or even an Applebee's. Here, journeys are measured in miles, and the roads lead you through a landscape kissed by water's edge. The town, my place in this world, is held in the embrace of water. To one side the vastness of Lake Michigan, to the other, the more intimate Lake Charlevoix, each offering their beaches where one might wade in the cool embrace of the waves.\n\nThe neighborhood here speaks of small-town life, where houses breathe with space, not stacked like bricks in a wall but standing alone, each with its own story. They are not the uniform creations of modern times but homes of another era, some renewed, others holding the patina of years. These homes stand with basements that show their faces to the road, and many are clad in the old armor of aluminum siding, their colors as varied as the leaves in autumn. Yards spread out before them, dotted with trampolines and playsets, gardens where the earth yields its bounty, and fences that hold back the creatures of the household.\n\nThis place is Middle America, where the people work by the sweat of their brows, raising families or having seen their children grow and leave. The streets are alive with the laughter of children, the rhythmic slap of dog paws, the hum of bicycles and the whisper of rollerblades. Neighbors nod to neighbors, and the strangers are known by the absence of recognition. A wave to a man at the grill, a smile to the woman walking a dog from far down the block. The lawns are neat, the grass clipped and green, leaves not left to gather and rot. It is not a neighborhood that dazzles with its beauty, but one that comforts with its promise—a place where families are raised in the quiet certainty of peace, a sanctuary at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s station stands watch, the health department close by, the city’s recycling center a stone’s throw away, all serving the people here. The fields of baseball and softball echo with the announcer’s calls, the small town airport abuzz with the drone of engines as small planes rise and fall in the sky. An ice cream shop beckons within a stroll, and the downtown’s heart can be reached by foot from this circle of homes. My children ride their bikes to a park not far off, a mere eight blocks away. It is a good place, a fine place to call home.",
            "The land where I find myself is a place of sameness, a tract of earth where houses stand in neat rows like soldiers at attention, each one a mirror to the next. Here the hand of the homeowner’s association is felt keen and sharp, shaping the world to its will. The lawns are clipped and tidy, a green uniformity broken only by stones set in patterns and the occasional tree, stunted and solitary. In the driveways, cars sit in pairs, sheltered beneath the roofs of twin garages. The streets themselves are smooth as glass, unmarred by the scars of time or neglect. No cracks, no holes. Just the unbroken sweep of new-laid concrete.\n\nThe houses rise mostly in single story, though here and there a second floor reaches skyward, an anomaly amid the conformity. There are no mailboxes before each door. Instead, at the street’s end, a cluster of metal boxes waits, keys in hand, to unlock the letters and packages within. The HOA has seen to this, their desire for order manifest in little things.\n\nWe stand at the city's edge, this place neither fully rural nor wholly suburban, but a blending of both. The land spreads wide and open, with room enough for pools where the water shivers under the sun, and trails that wind through the quiet, waiting for the feet of those who walk alone or with a dog at heel. The old come here to rest, their days measured in the slow drift of time. The young are fewer, but they are here too, mingling with their elders.\n\nThe city beyond is a contradiction, vast in its number but small in its heart. It has all that one might need, though never too much. A mall stands solitary, humble in its offerings, yet enough to serve. To reach the stores and the life of the city takes but a short drive, and once there, all the world unfolds. The rich foods and the cheap, the grand shops and the small. It is a place where needs are met, and yet, this is a world that asks nothing more than to be as it is. Safe and kept, a piece of the whole, and nothing more.",
            "The first I heard tell of the place was from a voice on a podcast, recounting tales of souls who had vanished into the ether. It took me by surprise. Here was a world where each apartment fetched over a thousand dollars a month and yet this story was unknown to me and mine. Perhaps it is the struggle. I know friends who lay awake in the night, eyes wet with tears. Life is dear, but we have learned to scrape by, finding beauty in the dust of flea market toys and clothes long packed away. The scent of adulthood is like a dusty magazine stacked upon a forgotten piano. It seeps into the leather and lingers long after the washing is done. Here, within a stone’s throw, lie three thrift stores. If you begin at one end, you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a hive, cars and people thronging the streets with the dawn, yet within the thrift stores, silence reigns. No matter how many souls pass by, the quiet holds. It’s a fine spot to while away the hours. Each year, the flood of cars and people grows. They call it a city in bloom, headquarters to one of the great online empires. It bears the scars of its growth still. It recalls New York to mind. Each person, each thing, pursues its own end, and not much is asked of you. You can keep to yourself, be still and silent, and folks will let you be. Unlike the South, where a touch of concern shows care, here lives go unexamined. You can maintain your shell as long as you wish, and the city will rise and fall like waves upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound. Between the pianist next door and the singers above, there’s always a tune in the air. In a fashion, we are less strangers in apartments and more a circle of friends. We gather for our needs, mark the passing of years, grieve and celebrate together, and lend a hand when we can. I count myself fortunate to be here. My neighbors are a good sort, and they treat me kindly. I keep the place tidy, share what I can, and they return the favor. We exchange letters and visits. It’s a simple pleasure, seeing them, and I believe they find some joy in my company as well. I dwell in this vast, impersonal expanse of modernity, yet it is the likes of my neighbors who make me feel perhaps I have not squandered my days entirely.",
            "In a small town perched on the edge of the city’s sprawl, where the east wind carries whispers of better times, I dwell. This place, neither forgotten nor entirely remembered, lies where the suburbs end and the earth begins to reclaim its own. The east side, where I make my home, is a patchwork of weary houses. Their paint long since faded, homes to souls who wrestle with an invisible hand that keeps their dreams tethered low to the ground. Yet the people are not without their grace. Faces that greet you with the warmth of a weary sun, nodding as you pass, their smiles worn but sincere. \n\nHere, the specter of crime lurks in the shadows, a part of the place like wind through the empty branches, though it seldom shows its face. In the decade past, violence has struck like sudden summer storms, leaving behind a silence more profound than before. Last year, the family next door lost their boy to a gunshot, a life ended outside the dim glow of a tavern’s neon promise. Our own steps have been lighter, with only the occasional loss of small things left too long on the porch, a reminder of the precarious peace we hold.\n\nThis town bears the scars of the opioid plague, a tragedy too great to be borne in silence. Lives extinguished by the quiet poison of fentanyl, their absence felt in the spaces they no longer fill. Yet in this darkness, there is light. Places of healing, where the lost might find their way back, and hands reaching out with the knowledge of Narcan, offering a lifeline where hope had faltered.\n\nIn the midst of these tribulations, the town holds fast to its virtues. My son’s school, a haven of laughter and learning, where kindness is the currency and differences are celebrated rather than scorned. The staff, from the principal's steady hand to the teachers’ guiding voices, create a world where he feels safe, loved. Events weave the families together, a tapestry of community and connection, each thread stronger for its neighbor.\n\nThough the weight of poverty hangs heavy, no child is left to hunger. The school ensures every one eats, breaking bread with dignity, the meals a daily act of grace. The burdens of fees and trips are lightened, allowing each child to walk unencumbered by want. The City Council, in their wisdom, has breathed new life into the heart of the town. Roads smooth as river stones, parks where laughter echoes, though the east side remains a landscape of neglect, its needs overshadowed by the commerce-driven west.\n\nYet I find solace here. The faces familiar, the kindnesses small but genuine. The shops sufficient to clothe and feed us, the house a haven, humble but ours. Sixteen years have passed in this place, our roots entwined with the earth beneath. We cannot imagine another land, another home. This town, flawed and beautiful, is where we belong.",
            "The neighborhood lies sprawled across the hill, a place thick with stories and shadows. High above, the buildings stand, sentinels of history, with their facades etched by time. I reside in a seven-story edifice, staring out at the old theater, its presence a whisper of yesteryear's grandeur. Down the slope, a block away, sits a vibrant arcade bar where souls of all kinds gather like moths to a flame on those balmy summer eves. When June turns to July, the line stretches long and winding, a testament to the life that pulses here. The park, a stone’s throw north, sprawls wide, a hidden oasis amidst the city's concrete heart. In winter’s chill, the homeless find solace, raising their tents in ordered lines upon the pavement and steps. The snow seldom falls, but the rain, it comes in sheets, a relentless curtain that chills to the bone. They huddle close, seeking warmth in the city's core, near the family center where they might wash away the cold.\n\nYet it is not the buildings nor the bygone elegance that holds my heart. It is the people, the culture, alive in every face and every corner. Hilltop, once notorious, carries the weight of its past in stories whispered through alleys and across generations. They speak of a time when the government swept through, a storm trying to cleanse the streets. The people remember, and they pass these tales on, even to newcomers like me. Though the streets still bear the scars, the community strives to keep them clean, to hold onto hope. They say if your skin is pale, the night is not yours in Hilltop. But this warning is a ghost, an echo of old fears. Perhaps I am dark enough to blend, or maybe I am simply a child of Hilltop, aware of the shadows that linger, the reminders of a world not yet healed. Here, racism and fear still weave their threads, even in this supposed melting pot.\n\nYet no matter where I wander, Hilltop calls to me. The night streets are alive, and in them, I find my place. The people are kind, offering warmth instead of harm. The laundromat stays open for me to find shelter from the storm. And on the bleakest nights, when I imagine myself unseen, someone will pause, look into my eyes, press a bill into my hand, and remind me of my worth. In this place, I am home.",
            "I came to this place when the world was just opening up to me at the start of eighth grade. There was a solitude in those first days, a quiet unfamiliarity that lingered like a shadow, but soon the silence gave way to voices and the faces of friends. There were two of them, living near as the crow flies, their laughter and stories becoming a part of the air I breathed. They've since gone on to other places, yet their presence remains etched in the corners of memory. The people who greeted me at the outset are still here, their lives woven into the fabric of this suburban expanse.\n\nThe neighborhood sprawls like a tapestry of two-story homes. On weekends, when the sun warms the earth, the voices of children rise up, a chorus of innocence carried on the breeze. The weekdays whisper a different music, one of stillness and the quiet hum of life passing by. Here, in this enclave, troubles are few, and solitude is a choice, not a sentence. Packages left on doorsteps remain untouched, a testament to a trust that binds one neighbor to the next.\n\nA stone's throw from my door lies a park, a realm of recollections. It's a place where the echoes of basketballs and footballs linger, where victories and defeats played out beneath the wide sky. It holds both laughter and pain, like the time a misstep left me with a bloody nose. Yet even that memory, sharp as it was, is softened by the warmth of so many afternoons spent in the company of friends. Now, the park is a domain I share with my cousin's children, their joy tangible as they swing and slide, the world a wonder to their eyes.\n\nThis neighborhood speaks in many tongues, its diversity a testament to the life it holds. Within a short stretch of road, the scents of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian kitchens mingle, though many now turn to the convenience of meals brought to their door by unseen hands. Fast food joints, ubiquitous in their presence, share the streets with pizza parlors, each offering a slice of familiarity. The stores, varied and plentiful, stand ready to meet every need. A Walgreens and a CVS stand sentinel on the main thoroughfare, alongside a Jewel-Osco, the Midwest's contribution to the grocery world. Even the stores reflect the neighborhood's mosaic, as an Indian-owned shop offers both homemade and ready-made flavors from afar.\n\nIn this place, I find a quiet contentment. The stories of others, their neighborhoods filled with strife and discord, serve as a reminder of the peace I have found here. For that, I am grateful.",
            "In the shadow of the college where I study lies the neighborhood I call home, a place stitched together by apartment blocks and the occasional haunt where one might find a drink or a meal without emptying their pockets. There's a bar, newly christened, where the prices climb higher but the spirits and service remain as ever they were, not the worst a man might find. The folk here are mostly students or those of lesser means, drawn by the modest rents that beckon from the buildings, old as they may seem from without, their hearts perhaps renewed. Children spill from the nearby school, their laughter carried on the wind, and though I see my neighbors, I know them not nor wish to, their habits of smoke and weed a jest to my boyfriend and I, what with the management’s crude attempt at masking the scent with air fresheners. \n\nDown the way stand new apartments, shiny and false, their very walls a testament to haste and thrift, yet they demand a king's ransom for rent. A scam it seems, yet they thrive on their proximity to campus, luring tenants with their glittering facade. There's a place, not five minutes on foot, where food comes on paper plates and the microwave hums its sad tune, a testament to cheap sustenance. Across lies a gas station, whispered about in tones that speak of hardship. But the summer past brought change to the road, a gift from the city that laid down wide sidewalks and green medians, a touch of grace upon the land, though my building stands ensconced in trees, a grove that holds the world at bay. Not all survived the culling, for stumps stand sentinel, reminders of what was, yet still the trees outnumber those down the street. \n\nBeyond my home, another street runs, 43rd, its visage less kind. The sidewalks crumble and the buildings wear their age like a shroud. Here are trees too, perhaps to cloak the decay. Crime finds purchase in the complex down the street, but it’s not the only one to blame. Across from me, another den of transience, where people come and go like the turning of a page. Yet I find solace where I am, for it is within my means, and the conveniences gather around me like old friends. The university is but a short walk, and two bus stops stand ready to carry me to the store or to the heart of the city with ease.",
            "The street runs in a circle, a cul-de-sac where duplexes stand like solitary sentinels, their facades washed in the same sunbaked yellow. Each wears a white porch like a collar and a green metal roof that gleams under the sky's indifferent blue gaze. These are not just houses but homes, tethered by the thin thread of friendly discourse, neighbors gathering at the cusp of driveways to share words as the sun dips low, their children painting the world with chalk or chasing the wind with kites. It is a place out of time, where the mechanical hum of modernity seems but a distant echo.\n\nFields and trees shoulder the neighborhood, standing sentinel beneath the vast sky where clouds billow like sails on a forgotten sea. Yet there is a darkness that looms. This season the air is thick with the promise of storms, sirens wailing their ghostly warning. Last night the sound came, a siren's keen lament, and we sought the refuge of our shelters. I sat in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my large dog paced the living room, restless as the storm itself. The world outside was silent but for the hail's ferocious tattoo upon the earth. \n\nWhen at last the storm relented, the road exhaled steam, a ghostly breath from the sudden shift in temperature. The heat refused to yield, and the hail melted upon the pavement's embrace. Above, the sky began to clear, and the sun's fingers reached down through the rain, painting a double rainbow upon the canvas of the heavens. I ran for my camera, capturing the fleeting wonder to share with those distant through the cold glass screen. They marveled, and so did I. \n\nThe quiet held the streets in its arms for a time, until the world awoke and life returned, mothers calling their children in as dinner simmered. It is a place of kindness, this new home of mine, far from where I once stood in New Hampshire. The southern drawl wraps around words like a warm shawl. I reside in a two-bedroom place, as do all here, though within each the space changes, some rooms shrinking into themselves. It is a mystery. \n\nBehind my dwelling, a great field stretches out, a green expanse leading to a pond that forbids the caress of swimmers. Deer wander there, and in the morning the bullfrog's song rises like a hymn. It is a good place to live, a mere forty minutes from the city's pulse. The dawn is heralded by roosters crowing from nearby farms, a call to a new day. A donkey brays in the evening, reminding us all of our place in this small village-like world. I have found a jewel in this place, a sanctuary in the southern soil.",
            "In the long years since I first set foot here, the years that have come and gone like pages blown across a field, I reckon I’ve learned a thing or two. I recall the sorrow that took hold of me when we left Riverdale. The tears I shed as we departed for Stockbridge, a place unknown and unwelcome then. But my folks wanted better, always better, for me and my sister. The houses were finer, the schools were finer. They said it wasn’t ghetto and that was reason enough. In time, I made peace with it, found friends and foes in equal measure at the school. The neighbors, they mostly stayed strangers, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, Dennis too, living right beside us. They've been a lot like family in their own ways and I hold them dear. I remember the day we all went to Mr. Glen’s wedding, him and Ms. Veda tying the knot anew. A day of joy and laughter, a glimpse of what I hope to find as I lay stones on my own path, dreaming of a life fit for a queen. When Ms. Veda tossed that little white garter, it was me who caught it, though the flowers slipped through my fingers. We danced till the stars wore thin, Marsharii and me. Haven’t seen her since. Hope she's found her own way. The neighborhood, it’s a tangle of streets and turns, though these days I’ve got a GPS to guide me. I’ve wandered a bit, mostly with Kason and Curtis, my companions in the art of idling. We played our games, lived our lives with a fervor only youth can muster. Sometimes I’d find my way to the park, seeking the solace only nature bestows. There’s a peace in it, a calm. I’d bring my sticks from the depot, honing balance, wielding my wooden sword against the unseen foes of the world. There’s a court for basketball and tennis, long abandoned by me but there still, waiting should the urge to play return. My father, he taught us tennis alongside Mr. Graves. We sweated and laughed under the sun’s watchful eye. There’s stories aplenty, tales of joy and hardship woven into the fabric of this place. And yet, I feel the best is still to come, waiting just beyond the horizon.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town unassuming in its quietude, a place where the world seems to slow and the dust settles gently on the roadways. Johnston, they call it, a name that whispers through the fields of peach and cattle. Claiming its fame as the Peach Capital of the World, its sign stands with a pride that belies its simplicity, welcoming all who wander through its borders. The land is vast and open, a patchwork of farms and fields, where the earth yields its bounty under the relentless sun. The houses, when they appear, sit back from the road, nestled in the embrace of their own expanse, roofs of metal or shingle guarding against the summer's wrath. \n\nIn the heart of the town, a lone stoplight marks the crossroad, casting its red and green upon the handful of stores that stand resolute. A Chinese place called Hong Kong, a fiesta of Mexican fare, and Gary's burgers offer their fast relief to weary travelers. Once, there was a pizzeria, but its doors have long since closed, leaving behind only the memory of its warmth. A pharmacy named Maxwell and Halford Drug persists, known not for its remedies but for the cherry cola that flows sweet and sticky from its coolers. The IGA stands as the sole purveyor of groceries, though its aisles see fewer feet, as many choose the journey to Walmart in distant Batesburg-Leesville.\n\nYet, it is Dollar General that draws the town's life to it, a marketplace of necessity where the rhythm of commerce beats steady from dawn till dusk. Nearby, a furniture store, Possibilities, remains a testament to endurance, its owner a fixture in the tapestry of Johnston's people. And beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a sanctuary for creatures great and small, offers its gentle care.\n\nThe town's edges hold a doctor’s office and a veterinary practice, small sanctuaries of healing for the folks who call this place home. The children gather at Johnston Elementary, their laughter and learning confined until the fifth grade, whereupon they must journey to a neighboring town for further schooling. No parks grace this land yet, though plans unfurl for a modest stretch of recreation to bring life to its soil.\n\nThere is little to occupy one's time here, no theaters or lanes for bowling, no places for idle gatherings, yet the town holds its charm in the whispers of its streets and the stories of its soil. It is a place so small you might pass it by, a mere blink and gone, yet within its bounds lies a world entire, quiet and enduring.",
            "In the heart of a small southern town in Tennessee, I find myself settled in a suburb like many others. The street runs between two state highways, and it draws more traffic than one might care for, but beyond that, the neighborhood rests in a kind of quietude. Folks around here don't come and go much, and so the faces remain familiar, each etched into the landscape like the trees that stand sentinel over us. Busy with their yards and the daily grind of living, they pass the seasons in simple labors. Winter sees children sledding down the hill by the side street, their laughter carried on the cold air. Our house sits at the front corner, and from there, we watch the world slide by, noting the cars, the strangers among them, a measure of vigilance we all keep. Neighbors walk their dogs or themselves, and children roam on bikes as if tethered to the past.\n\nOur days revolve around this place, home in more ways than one, for work ties us to its walls. Four of us fill its rooms—myself, my wife, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen. We weave ourselves into the fabric of this street, coming and going as thread through a loom. Sometimes, we spill out into the rain, oblivious to its chill, and the grill on the back deck sends sweet smoke into the world, a scent that blends with the incessant hum of lawnmowers from March till October when the grass gives up its growth. The trees here are plentiful, remnants of the forest that once was, and they cast their shadows long. But come fall, they shed their leaves, and we rake them into piles to burn. The scent of burning leaves is a harbinger of the season, a reminder that fall has taken hold.\n\nThe winters of late do not bite as they once did, leaving autumn to linger in their stead. Our garage, tucked at the back of the house, sees more use than the front door. It's there I work on my truck or tinker with whatever project calls to me, the open doors a window into the life that unfolds beyond. Holidays bring a hush over the street, except for the swell of cars when families gather from afar. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas, each marks its time with the arrival of visitors. In all of it, there is a sense of belonging, and though the road runs through, it feels like home enough. If only it were a road that ended, it might be perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where the earth sprawls in the eternal embrace of dust and sand, my neighborhood rests in a quiet defiance against time. The land is a tapestry of brown, a hue that stretches to the horizons, and only those who call this place home truly grasp the omnipresence of this color. Green lawns are a rarity, a testament to fortunes spent on coaxing life from the arid soil. Back in the nineties, the houses lay scattered like seeds sown by a wandering hand, and though the years have passed, the earth remains much the same, albeit dotted now with new constructions rising like stubborn monuments. This place, it grows more akin to a city with each passing day, a fate shared by many lands in this changing world. \n\nThe folk here, they carry the warmth of the desert sun, mostly kind, though like any city, shadows linger in corners. My own street harbors the elderly, gentle souls who mark this as a place of neighborly grace. The stores are those of chains, familiar names like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For finer fare, one must journey afar; Whole Foods and such are strangers in these parts. The work that draws men here is the building of things, for this city is yet unfinished, vast spaces waiting to be claimed by the hands of men. It holds a certain dread for me, this march of progress, for I fled the clamor of a great city and have no wish to return. \n\nConstruction is my trade, the art of drywall and T-bar, and in this craft, I find my daily bread. Yet what endears this place to me, beyond the toil, is the life that thrives despite the harshness. The desert is a canvas painted with creatures that dart and scuttle, a wonderland for my children who chase lizards and beetles under the unyielding sun. High desert climes forge ecosystems both fragile and fierce, demanding respect from those who dwell here. We, my kin and I, have learned to live in harmony with these wild neighbors. \n\nIn our town, attractions are few but cherished. Victorville, it stands as a gateway to the desert's embrace, offering families a taste of its rugged beauty. The annual San Bernardino County Fair breathes life into our days, a carnival of joy and simple pleasures. Beyond, the mountains of Wrightwood beckon, their snow-clad peaks a siren's call to those seeking winter's touch. For those drawn to the stories of earth and man, the Victor Valley Museum holds tales of stone and bone, of the people who carved their lives into this unforgiving land.\n\nThus, in this arid cradle, life persists, a testament to resilience, and in its quiet persistence, I find a certain peace.",
            "In the waking hours when the light is yet faint and the world trembles on the brink of another day’s unfolding, I reckon my neighborhood in a way perhaps less common, less known. Others might speak of tidy houses in a row, each with its own tale and hearth, but mine is a sprawl of academic halls and dormitories, the college grounds my own peculiar province. The people who dwell here, they form the heart of my community, though beyond the brick and mortar they too stretch, like the branches of some ancient tree, into the wider campus, which serves as my neighborhood in its own wild and unyielding way. \n\nIt is the same and yet not the same as the neighborhoods of old with their quiet streets and corner stores. Here too are places of dwelling, people moving like shadows across the green, stores with their wares, and parks with their solemn retreat. Let me lay before you the dwellings that mark this place. There are three kinds as I know them: apartments, houses, and the dormitory halls. \n\nThe apartments, they stack and rise like books upon a shelf, each room holding two to four souls, and floors numbering two, maybe more. Twenty souls or so gather in such a space, living, breathing, learning. Then there are the houses, a rare thing, scattered like seeds among the grounds, filled often with alumni, those who once were and now remain tied to the school’s embrace. \n\nBut most common are the dormitories, vast and teeming, where hundreds lay their heads, sharing rooms, sharing lives, in a community that pulses and shifts like the tide. \n\nIn this place, diversity is the law, as unyielding as gravity. Faces from all corners of the earth find themselves here, drawn to this place of learning. The staff find refuge in houses, the young ones in dormitories, and the elder students, wiser perhaps, in the apartments. \n\nThe people defy description, each a world unto themselves, and so let us speak instead of the stores and parks. This college, this self-contained universe, holds within it all manner of stores, from those that feed the body to those that clothe it, unique in their offerings yet familiar, the scent of academia upon them. \n\nAnd the park, a refuge amidst the stone and glass, is a gathering place for the diverse souls, a sanctuary kept safe by the hands of the community, clean and free from the shadows that plague the world beyond. \n\nIn this place, everything needed lies within reach, the boundaries of the neighborhood holding all things fast, as if in the embrace of a world entire.",
            "In the place where I live sidewalks are a rarity. All things seem to flow downward, cresting at the house at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill. Joggers test their mettle against its incline, running up the narrow road where the pavement bears the scars of time and weather. Pits and ruts that make for treacherous driving. The telephone and electric wires drape from pole to pole, tattered and forlorn. Storms rage in this country, and the wind and the rain bring down branches that strike at the lines. Repairs leave them a patchwork shamble. Tall evergreens rise everywhere about, though folks here despise them. They cut them down to clear the view of the ocean, building their homes high atop the hill with great glass walls to drink in the vista of the bay. At sunset, when the light beneath the waves ignites and the sky burns orange, it is a beauty that wounds the soul. Yet more often than not clouds hang low, and the sun's rays come filtered through a haze. Days are damp and overcast, and moss creeps over every surface it can claim: roofs and cars and railings alike. I left my car in the drive for a month and when I returned it was green and furred with moss, and it took hours to scrape it clean.  \n\nChildren are few in these parts, despite the school not far off. The neighbors are mostly older, retired, their lawns populated by dogs in place of offspring. The dogs roam free, racing down the street, and if a door or window is left ajar they may slip inside. I found one in the living room once, had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits run wild, too, and some grow large, digging up the roots of plants, burrowing into lawns, much to the gardeners' dismay. My cats hunt them with a vengeance, driving them from our vicinity. Birds flit about, sparrows and hummingbirds, with the hawks and eagles sometimes swooping low until the crows rise to chase them off.  \n\nThere's no store nearby, but if you head down the hill toward the waterfront, you'll find a handful of restaurants serving fresh catch. The beach is scant, more rock than sand, but the stones make for good throwing into the bay, which is not wide. Even through the mist you can see the far shore, a line across the water, constant and unyielding.",
            "In the sprawling cityscape of New York, there's a place called Bensonhurst. It's not hard to find, not with public transportation weaving through like sinews in a great beast. This urban enclave holds all the chaos and vibrancy of the city itself. Walk the streets and you'll meet the eyes of the Asian storefronts, a testament to the waves of souls who came seeking something on these shores. Two decades of change have painted the neighborhood in new colors, the lines of its face altered yet familiar.\n\nThe markets and laundromats—they stand sentinel on each block, their doors open to the world. The food is good, the prices fair, and convenience reigns supreme in this corner of the city. In a stretch no longer than a child's laughter, four supermarkets cater to the needs of the people. This is Bensonhurst, diverse in its bones and sinews, with generations of immigrants mingling among the streets. The businesses, large and small, ripple with the influence of their Asian proprietors, shaping the rhythm of daily life.\n\nThere's a park nearby, where the city's children run free. Ten basketball courts, fields wide enough for the dreams of soccer and baseball, handball walls to echo the slap of a ball. Swings and a playground offer respite, and in the heat of summer, a fountain becomes a haven. Here, the fabric of humanity is as varied as the city itself, each stitch a different hue.\n\nBuildings rise here and there, co-ops and condos, but mostly it's the houses, two families to a plot, that hold the stories of the people. The air is alive with sound, music blaring from cars, engines roaring in the dawn. It's a noisy place, but the noise is life. Yet, when night falls, you must tread carefully. The streets can turn on you, and in their shadows lurk the unpredictable. Memories of assaults long past and packages pilfered from doorsteps linger like ghosts.\n\nThe city's rules are a whisper against the wind. Fines for unheeded norms, for the mess left by dogs on their morning rounds. You walk, eyes cast downward, wary of where you place your feet. It's the smallest things that can unsettle you, the little grievances that gnaw at the edges of your peace. In Bensonhurst, as in all places, you find the good and the less so, side by side, as the city goes on, ever living, ever changing.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, there's a thread you must grasp to understand its soul, and that thread is called \"weird.\" Painted bold on the backside of a building—a place that wears many masks as a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, and skirts the edges of the law—is the town's unofficial creed: \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, it echoes a lament for the Portland of yesteryears, the nineties and early two-thousands, a city less known, less burdened by cost, a crucible of creativity and subcultures. For others, it's a siren call—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is not a slur but a badge of honor. Even as the city swells with newcomers from California, the skyline crammed with condominiums to house them, Portland remains steadfastly weird. Yet, weird does not always embrace; it simply lets things be that which they usually are not. It does not mean we shun modernity or the battles it brings. Like the rest of the land, we import our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to flout the norm, yet Portland is no stranger to the mundane. It's a city of yoga and hipsters and suited professionals. Perhaps to be weird here is to carry it all with a lighter heart. My neighborhood, like many, is a tapestry of painted houses and gardens that spill over with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, where free boxes sprout like wildflowers in the summer. These boxes, humble cardboard or plastic, offer up their contents to the wanderer—a gift, a treasure meant for the one who finds it. They hold clothes and books, sometimes more, sometimes less, but always a promise of serendipity. This is the magic of walking through a Southeast Portland street—that is, what it means to me, though I am but one shade in a spectrum of weird. Among us, some would never stoop to pick their clothes from a sidewalk box. They seek their strangeness in goat yoga or the roaring stands of Timbers matches. Portland is a haven for those who love their passions fiercely, whether they chase dreams or find them at the bottom of a glass in a dim-lit bar. Yes, we have our demons. Drugs seep through the city like rain through the gutters, their root often in the mind's shadows, fed by the endless rain and the gray sky's weight. Homelessness is a specter that haunts us, a puzzle with no easy answer. Our city's hands stretch out with services, better than most, yet never enough, like elsewhere. Between care and disdain, we sway, and in this we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stood eternal in their northern fastness, bearing witness to the sun's rites at every dawn and dusk, indifferent to the stirrings of man or the petty tides of his days. They watched, unblinking, as I moved through the world below, their presence a constant, immutable truth. In times of turmoil, when life pressed upon me with its myriad demands, they summoned my gaze, demanding to be seen, offering a moment's respite to my restless soul. It was here I came as a young scholar, drawn to the university nestled in their shadow. The mountains claimed me first, their majesty eclipsing the allure of the stately buildings and tranquil ponds of the campus. The town, too, held its charms, a tapestry of quaint cafés where many a night was spent in caffeine-induced study. A short journey brought one to the heart of the town, where the faded bricks of old buildings whispered of a history rich and enduring. Here, the town pulsed with the vigor of life, a brief mimicry of the bustling city nearby, yet all too soon it yielded back to the quietude of its suburban soul. This dance of contrasts, the city's restless energy and the town's serene quietude, invited exploration and the weaving of memories. There were nights spent wandering, laughter echoing past rusty swings, or racing through the vibrant streets to catch a show, the tickets a gift from the university. Yet, the town also bore witness to life's harsher truths, as all places must. The ponds, especially, became a refuge for reflection or the silent tears of existential doubt in the small hours. I found myself pondering my place in the great tapestry of life, watching the turtles and ducks and insects, each playing their part. And so I walked, past the pond and park and the rows of houses steeped in suburban quiet, until I reached the main street. The sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, the sky a canvas of blue and yellow, and I realized my steps had led me northward. There they were, the mountains, steadfast and towering, grazing the sky with their ancient forms. In their silent strength, they stirred within me a will to endure.",
            "In the dim shade of a sun-baked afternoon, you might pass it by without a second thought. Just a residential area, lurking behind a tattered shopping strip, not the sort of place one would reckon folks lay their heads. Surely not the sort of place most would choose. Yet, if your feet lead you past the derelict husk of the old Whole Foods and beyond the weary hotels standing empty but for those scattered summer gatherings, you'll stumble upon a hidden hive of life. Streets lined with apartment blocks, standing shoulder to shoulder, like Russian dolls meticulously disassembled and placed out in a solemn procession along the road. The first of these buildings, infamous from the news, speak of dealings best left unspoken. Appearances, they are deceptive things. Yet, in the shadow of these, the remaining complexes hold a world unknown to those who wander these parts. Across from them, the community college's satellite campus sits, a cluster of sleepy edifices, guarding the road. Students drift in with coffee clutched close, eyes heavy with the dawn, starting their days in a drowsy haze. The iron gates creak and groan, letting them in, one by one, as the commuters curse and gnash their teeth, the traffic swells and ebbs with the morning tide.  \n\nThe road ends at a crossroads, where a park sprawls on one side and a rehabilitation center, a haven for those with bones fractured by fate, stands on the other. Its porch hosts cheerful furniture, and the ceiling fan turns slow, stirring the thick summer air like a gentle hand through water. Children dart and dance across the park's grassy expanse, limbs flailing joyously among the bees that buzz 'round the flowers. Retirees walk dogs along the path, eyes narrowed at the skateboarders, nodding politely at the teenage girls, who whisper of boys and the latest YouTube idols. Nearby, a sushi joint sits in the strip mall’s embrace, serving modest fare to sparse crowds. A swimming supply store clings close beside, a nail salon nestled between. One could ready a pool, manicure nails, and feast on hibachi chicken all in one breath—the strange allure of the strip mall. A frozen yogurt place too, where teens from the park clutch chilled cups, adorned with toppings, as they skate and vape, chasing the ghost of cool. This neighborhood, a slice of Americana, a relic of the languid South where time drifts slow, like the smoke from a distant fire.",
            "The neighborhood's a place of quiet mystery, a tapestry of single-family homes interwoven with those split in twain yet bound together, a strange harmony that makes a kind of sense. Our house stands with its small yard in the fore and a narrow drive to the left, a relic of a time when the suburbs promised the American dream, that once-sweet embrace now turned away, leaving us to grasp what remains. Yet the neighborhood endures, calling out in its mute way that the dream lives still, clung to by those who wander its streets. The folk here, they've lost some of the shine in their eyes, their yards untended as once they weren't, but cars still grace the drives, and children run and shout, their games the whole of their world.\n\nThe old public school, nearing a century, stands firm, conjuring futures for the young and stirring memories in the old. Churches, sparse and echoing, stand mostly empty, but the basketball courts still resound with life. Each home bears its own face yet they echo one another, a chorus of sameness. Super \"A,\" the supermarket, is held by a Yemeni family, the sole Arabs in this place where most folk are African American. Wide streets stretch out, fields for children playing football, pausing only for passing cars.\n\nGenerations have walked these streets, tales of a time when all knew each other spoken in the quiet of porches. There was a karate school once, but as Hollywood's tales of the Karate Kid faded, so did the children's dreams, and now it's a pharmacy, for such are the times. A small theater shows old films, shunned by the young for lack of new spectacle, but cherished by elders, a bargain for a night away from the clamor.\n\nAn expressway cuts through, its exits lying beyond our reach, the youth having clamored for their own gateway, a notion the elders quashed, fearing it would mar what we have. Now a new high school rises, and in it, a choice for a mascot. I think of a cyborg with a country twang, a cabin of logs, a fitting emblem for this place of ours.",
            "In the sprawl of this city, the neighborhood winds through a tapestry of lives and places, each thread distinct yet woven into the whole. The city breathes with the cadence of its diversity, blocks lined with dwellings that stand amidst the scatter of businesses, each pursuing its own commerce under the vast indifferent sky. Here, in this labyrinth of streets, restaurants rise like sentinels offering their fare, while shops both grand and humble beckon all who wander by. The boutiques, with their small windows and whispered promises, nestle beside the giants of corporate commerce, their shadows stretching across pavements that lead to parks where parents watch their children at play, laughter echoing in the open air.\n\nThe people of this place are as varied as the city itself. Each face tells a story, and they gather in communities, each with its own pulse. Here, a vibrant LGBTQ+ community flourishes beside the solemnity of Orthodox Jewish life, and nearby, the echoes of the former Soviet Union linger in the voices of refugees and immigrants. Beyond these borders, the city stretches wide, where each district bears the stamp of those who call it home—Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—all within a stone's throw yet separated by the slow crawl of traffic that chokes the city's arteries.\n\nFew choose to walk the endless streets, for the city sprawls far and wide, and the vehicles claim the roads with their ceaseless noise. Construction cranes swing their long arms, raising new towers into the skyline, drawing more souls to this crowded land. The residents watch, some with hope, others with wary eyes, for the roads groan beneath the weight of so many, and the hunt for a place to rest one's car is a trial unto itself.\n\nYet within this chaos lies choice. There are houses and homes, spread across the city in their multitude of forms. Large apartments rise like cliffs, but for those who seek the quiet, there are smaller buildings, single-family homes, and duplexes that hold their ground against the encroaching tide. Here too, the people differ, each age and story a part of the city's fabric. But the bonds that once tied neighbor to neighbor have weakened, and the streets remember a time when children's laughter filled the air, when the games of youth bound them together in camaraderie beneath the watchful gaze of long-vanished summers.",
            "Where's everything? she said as we rolled through the endless cornfields, the horizon swallowed whole by the stalks. This is it, I told her, knowing the vastness would leave her stunned. She came from a place where the grocery store lay but a five-minute stroll away—never had she seen such open sky. Awash in the sameness of corn, I spoke of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew me and the soil from which I came. The road stretched on, a narrow country lane, till it met a quarry filled with water, and just beyond, the small settlement that was home. These houses, brick and stucco, each resting on their half-acre plots, land that folks here took pride in tending. Come spring, flowers burst forth, and trees of the Midwest donned their seasonal dress. Driveways lined with gleaming Mercedes, their chrome bright under the noonday sun after a careful wash.\n\nOnward we drove toward my gray stucco home, past my Korean neighbor with his ever-present smile. He spent his days on the mower, his song rising above its drone, a man whose humor had softened with age. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and the hum of his John Deere. The neighborhood chuckled at his antics, but he was genuine, a soul with stories to tell. At last, my home. In the side yard, geese wandered, pursued by our Terrier. Out back, a stream fed the quarry, its voice mingling with the bullfrog's call and the distant lowing of cattle.\n\nAcross the bridge I built by hand lay an untouched oasis, wild with trees and herbs and flowers never planted. Here was the ground of my childhood, building forts in the trees, chasing creatures more imagined than real. Always something to do, a neighbor child to join in play. Winters came hard in our small town, the kind that cut to the bone, but they brought a beauty all their own. The land, once green, turned stark and bare, the trees mere skeletons against the sky. Snow fell sometimes, and overnight the world transformed, a winter's dream. The backyard filled with snow angels, my sister's hand in their making, and snowmen stood sentry. We fought often as children, my sister and I, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen arms. Our forts were grand, igloos built of branches, housing our arsenal. In that frozen world, we played at life, nothing beyond our make-believe mattered. We were children, unburdened by the weight of the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the quiet heart of rural America, in a small town in Michigan where the land shifts from sprawling farmland to quaint tourist enclaves, there are no sprawling city malls or chains of commerce like Wal-Mart or Target or even an Applebee's. Here, journeys are measured in miles, and the roads lead you through a landscape kissed by water's edge. The town, my place in this world, is held in the embrace of water. To one side the vastness of Lake Michigan, to the other, the more intimate Lake Charlevoix, each offering their beaches where one might wade in the cool embrace of the waves.\n\nThe neighborhood here speaks of small-town life, where houses breathe with space, not stacked like bricks in a wall but standing alone, each with its own story. They are not the uniform creations of modern times but homes of another era, some renewed, others holding the patina of years. These homes stand with basements that show their faces to the road, and many are clad in the old armor of aluminum siding, their colors as varied as the leaves in autumn. Yards spread out before them, dotted with trampolines and playsets, gardens where the earth yields its bounty, and fences that hold back the creatures of the household.\n\nThis place is Middle America, where the people work by the sweat of their brows, raising families or having seen their children grow and leave. The streets are alive with the laughter of children, the rhythmic slap of dog paws, the hum of bicycles and the whisper of rollerblades. Neighbors nod to neighbors, and the strangers are known by the absence of recognition. A wave to a man at the grill, a smile to the woman walking a dog from far down the block. The lawns are neat, the grass clipped and green, leaves not left to gather and rot. It is not a neighborhood that dazzles with its beauty, but one that comforts with its promise—a place where families are raised in the quiet certainty of peace, a sanctuary at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s station stands watch, the health department close by, the city’s recycling center a stone’s throw away, all serving the people here. The fields of baseball and softball echo with the announcer’s calls, the small town airport abuzz with the drone of engines as small planes rise and fall in the sky. An ice cream shop beckons within a stroll, and the downtown’s heart can be reached by foot from this circle of homes. My children ride their bikes to a park not far off, a mere eight blocks away. It is a good place, a fine place to call home.",
            "The land where I find myself is a place of sameness, a tract of earth where houses stand in neat rows like soldiers at attention, each one a mirror to the next. Here the hand of the homeowner’s association is felt keen and sharp, shaping the world to its will. The lawns are clipped and tidy, a green uniformity broken only by stones set in patterns and the occasional tree, stunted and solitary. In the driveways, cars sit in pairs, sheltered beneath the roofs of twin garages. The streets themselves are smooth as glass, unmarred by the scars of time or neglect. No cracks, no holes. Just the unbroken sweep of new-laid concrete.\n\nThe houses rise mostly in single story, though here and there a second floor reaches skyward, an anomaly amid the conformity. There are no mailboxes before each door. Instead, at the street’s end, a cluster of metal boxes waits, keys in hand, to unlock the letters and packages within. The HOA has seen to this, their desire for order manifest in little things.\n\nWe stand at the city's edge, this place neither fully rural nor wholly suburban, but a blending of both. The land spreads wide and open, with room enough for pools where the water shivers under the sun, and trails that wind through the quiet, waiting for the feet of those who walk alone or with a dog at heel. The old come here to rest, their days measured in the slow drift of time. The young are fewer, but they are here too, mingling with their elders.\n\nThe city beyond is a contradiction, vast in its number but small in its heart. It has all that one might need, though never too much. A mall stands solitary, humble in its offerings, yet enough to serve. To reach the stores and the life of the city takes but a short drive, and once there, all the world unfolds. The rich foods and the cheap, the grand shops and the small. It is a place where needs are met, and yet, this is a world that asks nothing more than to be as it is. Safe and kept, a piece of the whole, and nothing more.",
            "The first I heard tell of the place was from a voice on a podcast, recounting tales of souls who had vanished into the ether. It took me by surprise. Here was a world where each apartment fetched over a thousand dollars a month and yet this story was unknown to me and mine. Perhaps it is the struggle. I know friends who lay awake in the night, eyes wet with tears. Life is dear, but we have learned to scrape by, finding beauty in the dust of flea market toys and clothes long packed away. The scent of adulthood is like a dusty magazine stacked upon a forgotten piano. It seeps into the leather and lingers long after the washing is done. Here, within a stone’s throw, lie three thrift stores. If you begin at one end, you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a hive, cars and people thronging the streets with the dawn, yet within the thrift stores, silence reigns. No matter how many souls pass by, the quiet holds. It’s a fine spot to while away the hours. Each year, the flood of cars and people grows. They call it a city in bloom, headquarters to one of the great online empires. It bears the scars of its growth still. It recalls New York to mind. Each person, each thing, pursues its own end, and not much is asked of you. You can keep to yourself, be still and silent, and folks will let you be. Unlike the South, where a touch of concern shows care, here lives go unexamined. You can maintain your shell as long as you wish, and the city will rise and fall like waves upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound. Between the pianist next door and the singers above, there’s always a tune in the air. In a fashion, we are less strangers in apartments and more a circle of friends. We gather for our needs, mark the passing of years, grieve and celebrate together, and lend a hand when we can. I count myself fortunate to be here. My neighbors are a good sort, and they treat me kindly. I keep the place tidy, share what I can, and they return the favor. We exchange letters and visits. It’s a simple pleasure, seeing them, and I believe they find some joy in my company as well. I dwell in this vast, impersonal expanse of modernity, yet it is the likes of my neighbors who make me feel perhaps I have not squandered my days entirely.",
            "In a small town perched on the edge of the city’s sprawl, where the east wind carries whispers of better times, I dwell. This place, neither forgotten nor entirely remembered, lies where the suburbs end and the earth begins to reclaim its own. The east side, where I make my home, is a patchwork of weary houses. Their paint long since faded, homes to souls who wrestle with an invisible hand that keeps their dreams tethered low to the ground. Yet the people are not without their grace. Faces that greet you with the warmth of a weary sun, nodding as you pass, their smiles worn but sincere. \n\nHere, the specter of crime lurks in the shadows, a part of the place like wind through the empty branches, though it seldom shows its face. In the decade past, violence has struck like sudden summer storms, leaving behind a silence more profound than before. Last year, the family next door lost their boy to a gunshot, a life ended outside the dim glow of a tavern’s neon promise. Our own steps have been lighter, with only the occasional loss of small things left too long on the porch, a reminder of the precarious peace we hold.\n\nThis town bears the scars of the opioid plague, a tragedy too great to be borne in silence. Lives extinguished by the quiet poison of fentanyl, their absence felt in the spaces they no longer fill. Yet in this darkness, there is light. Places of healing, where the lost might find their way back, and hands reaching out with the knowledge of Narcan, offering a lifeline where hope had faltered.\n\nIn the midst of these tribulations, the town holds fast to its virtues. My son’s school, a haven of laughter and learning, where kindness is the currency and differences are celebrated rather than scorned. The staff, from the principal's steady hand to the teachers’ guiding voices, create a world where he feels safe, loved. Events weave the families together, a tapestry of community and connection, each thread stronger for its neighbor.\n\nThough the weight of poverty hangs heavy, no child is left to hunger. The school ensures every one eats, breaking bread with dignity, the meals a daily act of grace. The burdens of fees and trips are lightened, allowing each child to walk unencumbered by want. The City Council, in their wisdom, has breathed new life into the heart of the town. Roads smooth as river stones, parks where laughter echoes, though the east side remains a landscape of neglect, its needs overshadowed by the commerce-driven west.\n\nYet I find solace here. The faces familiar, the kindnesses small but genuine. The shops sufficient to clothe and feed us, the house a haven, humble but ours. Sixteen years have passed in this place, our roots entwined with the earth beneath. We cannot imagine another land, another home. This town, flawed and beautiful, is where we belong.",
            "The neighborhood lies sprawled across the hill, a place thick with stories and shadows. High above, the buildings stand, sentinels of history, with their facades etched by time. I reside in a seven-story edifice, staring out at the old theater, its presence a whisper of yesteryear's grandeur. Down the slope, a block away, sits a vibrant arcade bar where souls of all kinds gather like moths to a flame on those balmy summer eves. When June turns to July, the line stretches long and winding, a testament to the life that pulses here. The park, a stone’s throw north, sprawls wide, a hidden oasis amidst the city's concrete heart. In winter’s chill, the homeless find solace, raising their tents in ordered lines upon the pavement and steps. The snow seldom falls, but the rain, it comes in sheets, a relentless curtain that chills to the bone. They huddle close, seeking warmth in the city's core, near the family center where they might wash away the cold.\n\nYet it is not the buildings nor the bygone elegance that holds my heart. It is the people, the culture, alive in every face and every corner. Hilltop, once notorious, carries the weight of its past in stories whispered through alleys and across generations. They speak of a time when the government swept through, a storm trying to cleanse the streets. The people remember, and they pass these tales on, even to newcomers like me. Though the streets still bear the scars, the community strives to keep them clean, to hold onto hope. They say if your skin is pale, the night is not yours in Hilltop. But this warning is a ghost, an echo of old fears. Perhaps I am dark enough to blend, or maybe I am simply a child of Hilltop, aware of the shadows that linger, the reminders of a world not yet healed. Here, racism and fear still weave their threads, even in this supposed melting pot.\n\nYet no matter where I wander, Hilltop calls to me. The night streets are alive, and in them, I find my place. The people are kind, offering warmth instead of harm. The laundromat stays open for me to find shelter from the storm. And on the bleakest nights, when I imagine myself unseen, someone will pause, look into my eyes, press a bill into my hand, and remind me of my worth. In this place, I am home.",
            "I came to this place when the world was just opening up to me at the start of eighth grade. There was a solitude in those first days, a quiet unfamiliarity that lingered like a shadow, but soon the silence gave way to voices and the faces of friends. There were two of them, living near as the crow flies, their laughter and stories becoming a part of the air I breathed. They've since gone on to other places, yet their presence remains etched in the corners of memory. The people who greeted me at the outset are still here, their lives woven into the fabric of this suburban expanse.\n\nThe neighborhood sprawls like a tapestry of two-story homes. On weekends, when the sun warms the earth, the voices of children rise up, a chorus of innocence carried on the breeze. The weekdays whisper a different music, one of stillness and the quiet hum of life passing by. Here, in this enclave, troubles are few, and solitude is a choice, not a sentence. Packages left on doorsteps remain untouched, a testament to a trust that binds one neighbor to the next.\n\nA stone's throw from my door lies a park, a realm of recollections. It's a place where the echoes of basketballs and footballs linger, where victories and defeats played out beneath the wide sky. It holds both laughter and pain, like the time a misstep left me with a bloody nose. Yet even that memory, sharp as it was, is softened by the warmth of so many afternoons spent in the company of friends. Now, the park is a domain I share with my cousin's children, their joy tangible as they swing and slide, the world a wonder to their eyes.\n\nThis neighborhood speaks in many tongues, its diversity a testament to the life it holds. Within a short stretch of road, the scents of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian kitchens mingle, though many now turn to the convenience of meals brought to their door by unseen hands. Fast food joints, ubiquitous in their presence, share the streets with pizza parlors, each offering a slice of familiarity. The stores, varied and plentiful, stand ready to meet every need. A Walgreens and a CVS stand sentinel on the main thoroughfare, alongside a Jewel-Osco, the Midwest's contribution to the grocery world. Even the stores reflect the neighborhood's mosaic, as an Indian-owned shop offers both homemade and ready-made flavors from afar.\n\nIn this place, I find a quiet contentment. The stories of others, their neighborhoods filled with strife and discord, serve as a reminder of the peace I have found here. For that, I am grateful.",
            "In the shadow of the college where I study lies the neighborhood I call home, a place stitched together by apartment blocks and the occasional haunt where one might find a drink or a meal without emptying their pockets. There's a bar, newly christened, where the prices climb higher but the spirits and service remain as ever they were, not the worst a man might find. The folk here are mostly students or those of lesser means, drawn by the modest rents that beckon from the buildings, old as they may seem from without, their hearts perhaps renewed. Children spill from the nearby school, their laughter carried on the wind, and though I see my neighbors, I know them not nor wish to, their habits of smoke and weed a jest to my boyfriend and I, what with the management’s crude attempt at masking the scent with air fresheners. \n\nDown the way stand new apartments, shiny and false, their very walls a testament to haste and thrift, yet they demand a king's ransom for rent. A scam it seems, yet they thrive on their proximity to campus, luring tenants with their glittering facade. There's a place, not five minutes on foot, where food comes on paper plates and the microwave hums its sad tune, a testament to cheap sustenance. Across lies a gas station, whispered about in tones that speak of hardship. But the summer past brought change to the road, a gift from the city that laid down wide sidewalks and green medians, a touch of grace upon the land, though my building stands ensconced in trees, a grove that holds the world at bay. Not all survived the culling, for stumps stand sentinel, reminders of what was, yet still the trees outnumber those down the street. \n\nBeyond my home, another street runs, 43rd, its visage less kind. The sidewalks crumble and the buildings wear their age like a shroud. Here are trees too, perhaps to cloak the decay. Crime finds purchase in the complex down the street, but it’s not the only one to blame. Across from me, another den of transience, where people come and go like the turning of a page. Yet I find solace where I am, for it is within my means, and the conveniences gather around me like old friends. The university is but a short walk, and two bus stops stand ready to carry me to the store or to the heart of the city with ease.",
            "The street runs in a circle, a cul-de-sac where duplexes stand like solitary sentinels, their facades washed in the same sunbaked yellow. Each wears a white porch like a collar and a green metal roof that gleams under the sky's indifferent blue gaze. These are not just houses but homes, tethered by the thin thread of friendly discourse, neighbors gathering at the cusp of driveways to share words as the sun dips low, their children painting the world with chalk or chasing the wind with kites. It is a place out of time, where the mechanical hum of modernity seems but a distant echo.\n\nFields and trees shoulder the neighborhood, standing sentinel beneath the vast sky where clouds billow like sails on a forgotten sea. Yet there is a darkness that looms. This season the air is thick with the promise of storms, sirens wailing their ghostly warning. Last night the sound came, a siren's keen lament, and we sought the refuge of our shelters. I sat in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my large dog paced the living room, restless as the storm itself. The world outside was silent but for the hail's ferocious tattoo upon the earth. \n\nWhen at last the storm relented, the road exhaled steam, a ghostly breath from the sudden shift in temperature. The heat refused to yield, and the hail melted upon the pavement's embrace. Above, the sky began to clear, and the sun's fingers reached down through the rain, painting a double rainbow upon the canvas of the heavens. I ran for my camera, capturing the fleeting wonder to share with those distant through the cold glass screen. They marveled, and so did I. \n\nThe quiet held the streets in its arms for a time, until the world awoke and life returned, mothers calling their children in as dinner simmered. It is a place of kindness, this new home of mine, far from where I once stood in New Hampshire. The southern drawl wraps around words like a warm shawl. I reside in a two-bedroom place, as do all here, though within each the space changes, some rooms shrinking into themselves. It is a mystery. \n\nBehind my dwelling, a great field stretches out, a green expanse leading to a pond that forbids the caress of swimmers. Deer wander there, and in the morning the bullfrog's song rises like a hymn. It is a good place to live, a mere forty minutes from the city's pulse. The dawn is heralded by roosters crowing from nearby farms, a call to a new day. A donkey brays in the evening, reminding us all of our place in this small village-like world. I have found a jewel in this place, a sanctuary in the southern soil.",
            "In the long years since I first set foot here, the years that have come and gone like pages blown across a field, I reckon I’ve learned a thing or two. I recall the sorrow that took hold of me when we left Riverdale. The tears I shed as we departed for Stockbridge, a place unknown and unwelcome then. But my folks wanted better, always better, for me and my sister. The houses were finer, the schools were finer. They said it wasn’t ghetto and that was reason enough. In time, I made peace with it, found friends and foes in equal measure at the school. The neighbors, they mostly stayed strangers, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, Dennis too, living right beside us. They've been a lot like family in their own ways and I hold them dear. I remember the day we all went to Mr. Glen’s wedding, him and Ms. Veda tying the knot anew. A day of joy and laughter, a glimpse of what I hope to find as I lay stones on my own path, dreaming of a life fit for a queen. When Ms. Veda tossed that little white garter, it was me who caught it, though the flowers slipped through my fingers. We danced till the stars wore thin, Marsharii and me. Haven’t seen her since. Hope she's found her own way. The neighborhood, it’s a tangle of streets and turns, though these days I’ve got a GPS to guide me. I’ve wandered a bit, mostly with Kason and Curtis, my companions in the art of idling. We played our games, lived our lives with a fervor only youth can muster. Sometimes I’d find my way to the park, seeking the solace only nature bestows. There’s a peace in it, a calm. I’d bring my sticks from the depot, honing balance, wielding my wooden sword against the unseen foes of the world. There’s a court for basketball and tennis, long abandoned by me but there still, waiting should the urge to play return. My father, he taught us tennis alongside Mr. Graves. We sweated and laughed under the sun’s watchful eye. There’s stories aplenty, tales of joy and hardship woven into the fabric of this place. And yet, I feel the best is still to come, waiting just beyond the horizon.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town unassuming in its quietude, a place where the world seems to slow and the dust settles gently on the roadways. Johnston, they call it, a name that whispers through the fields of peach and cattle. Claiming its fame as the Peach Capital of the World, its sign stands with a pride that belies its simplicity, welcoming all who wander through its borders. The land is vast and open, a patchwork of farms and fields, where the earth yields its bounty under the relentless sun. The houses, when they appear, sit back from the road, nestled in the embrace of their own expanse, roofs of metal or shingle guarding against the summer's wrath. \n\nIn the heart of the town, a lone stoplight marks the crossroad, casting its red and green upon the handful of stores that stand resolute. A Chinese place called Hong Kong, a fiesta of Mexican fare, and Gary's burgers offer their fast relief to weary travelers. Once, there was a pizzeria, but its doors have long since closed, leaving behind only the memory of its warmth. A pharmacy named Maxwell and Halford Drug persists, known not for its remedies but for the cherry cola that flows sweet and sticky from its coolers. The IGA stands as the sole purveyor of groceries, though its aisles see fewer feet, as many choose the journey to Walmart in distant Batesburg-Leesville.\n\nYet, it is Dollar General that draws the town's life to it, a marketplace of necessity where the rhythm of commerce beats steady from dawn till dusk. Nearby, a furniture store, Possibilities, remains a testament to endurance, its owner a fixture in the tapestry of Johnston's people. And beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a sanctuary for creatures great and small, offers its gentle care.\n\nThe town's edges hold a doctor’s office and a veterinary practice, small sanctuaries of healing for the folks who call this place home. The children gather at Johnston Elementary, their laughter and learning confined until the fifth grade, whereupon they must journey to a neighboring town for further schooling. No parks grace this land yet, though plans unfurl for a modest stretch of recreation to bring life to its soil.\n\nThere is little to occupy one's time here, no theaters or lanes for bowling, no places for idle gatherings, yet the town holds its charm in the whispers of its streets and the stories of its soil. It is a place so small you might pass it by, a mere blink and gone, yet within its bounds lies a world entire, quiet and enduring.",
            "In the heart of a small southern town in Tennessee, I find myself settled in a suburb like many others. The street runs between two state highways, and it draws more traffic than one might care for, but beyond that, the neighborhood rests in a kind of quietude. Folks around here don't come and go much, and so the faces remain familiar, each etched into the landscape like the trees that stand sentinel over us. Busy with their yards and the daily grind of living, they pass the seasons in simple labors. Winter sees children sledding down the hill by the side street, their laughter carried on the cold air. Our house sits at the front corner, and from there, we watch the world slide by, noting the cars, the strangers among them, a measure of vigilance we all keep. Neighbors walk their dogs or themselves, and children roam on bikes as if tethered to the past.\n\nOur days revolve around this place, home in more ways than one, for work ties us to its walls. Four of us fill its rooms—myself, my wife, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen. We weave ourselves into the fabric of this street, coming and going as thread through a loom. Sometimes, we spill out into the rain, oblivious to its chill, and the grill on the back deck sends sweet smoke into the world, a scent that blends with the incessant hum of lawnmowers from March till October when the grass gives up its growth. The trees here are plentiful, remnants of the forest that once was, and they cast their shadows long. But come fall, they shed their leaves, and we rake them into piles to burn. The scent of burning leaves is a harbinger of the season, a reminder that fall has taken hold.\n\nThe winters of late do not bite as they once did, leaving autumn to linger in their stead. Our garage, tucked at the back of the house, sees more use than the front door. It's there I work on my truck or tinker with whatever project calls to me, the open doors a window into the life that unfolds beyond. Holidays bring a hush over the street, except for the swell of cars when families gather from afar. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas, each marks its time with the arrival of visitors. In all of it, there is a sense of belonging, and though the road runs through, it feels like home enough. If only it were a road that ended, it might be perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where the earth sprawls in the eternal embrace of dust and sand, my neighborhood rests in a quiet defiance against time. The land is a tapestry of brown, a hue that stretches to the horizons, and only those who call this place home truly grasp the omnipresence of this color. Green lawns are a rarity, a testament to fortunes spent on coaxing life from the arid soil. Back in the nineties, the houses lay scattered like seeds sown by a wandering hand, and though the years have passed, the earth remains much the same, albeit dotted now with new constructions rising like stubborn monuments. This place, it grows more akin to a city with each passing day, a fate shared by many lands in this changing world. \n\nThe folk here, they carry the warmth of the desert sun, mostly kind, though like any city, shadows linger in corners. My own street harbors the elderly, gentle souls who mark this as a place of neighborly grace. The stores are those of chains, familiar names like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For finer fare, one must journey afar; Whole Foods and such are strangers in these parts. The work that draws men here is the building of things, for this city is yet unfinished, vast spaces waiting to be claimed by the hands of men. It holds a certain dread for me, this march of progress, for I fled the clamor of a great city and have no wish to return. \n\nConstruction is my trade, the art of drywall and T-bar, and in this craft, I find my daily bread. Yet what endears this place to me, beyond the toil, is the life that thrives despite the harshness. The desert is a canvas painted with creatures that dart and scuttle, a wonderland for my children who chase lizards and beetles under the unyielding sun. High desert climes forge ecosystems both fragile and fierce, demanding respect from those who dwell here. We, my kin and I, have learned to live in harmony with these wild neighbors. \n\nIn our town, attractions are few but cherished. Victorville, it stands as a gateway to the desert's embrace, offering families a taste of its rugged beauty. The annual San Bernardino County Fair breathes life into our days, a carnival of joy and simple pleasures. Beyond, the mountains of Wrightwood beckon, their snow-clad peaks a siren's call to those seeking winter's touch. For those drawn to the stories of earth and man, the Victor Valley Museum holds tales of stone and bone, of the people who carved their lives into this unforgiving land.\n\nThus, in this arid cradle, life persists, a testament to resilience, and in its quiet persistence, I find a certain peace.",
            "In the waking hours when the light is yet faint and the world trembles on the brink of another day’s unfolding, I reckon my neighborhood in a way perhaps less common, less known. Others might speak of tidy houses in a row, each with its own tale and hearth, but mine is a sprawl of academic halls and dormitories, the college grounds my own peculiar province. The people who dwell here, they form the heart of my community, though beyond the brick and mortar they too stretch, like the branches of some ancient tree, into the wider campus, which serves as my neighborhood in its own wild and unyielding way. \n\nIt is the same and yet not the same as the neighborhoods of old with their quiet streets and corner stores. Here too are places of dwelling, people moving like shadows across the green, stores with their wares, and parks with their solemn retreat. Let me lay before you the dwellings that mark this place. There are three kinds as I know them: apartments, houses, and the dormitory halls. \n\nThe apartments, they stack and rise like books upon a shelf, each room holding two to four souls, and floors numbering two, maybe more. Twenty souls or so gather in such a space, living, breathing, learning. Then there are the houses, a rare thing, scattered like seeds among the grounds, filled often with alumni, those who once were and now remain tied to the school’s embrace. \n\nBut most common are the dormitories, vast and teeming, where hundreds lay their heads, sharing rooms, sharing lives, in a community that pulses and shifts like the tide. \n\nIn this place, diversity is the law, as unyielding as gravity. Faces from all corners of the earth find themselves here, drawn to this place of learning. The staff find refuge in houses, the young ones in dormitories, and the elder students, wiser perhaps, in the apartments. \n\nThe people defy description, each a world unto themselves, and so let us speak instead of the stores and parks. This college, this self-contained universe, holds within it all manner of stores, from those that feed the body to those that clothe it, unique in their offerings yet familiar, the scent of academia upon them. \n\nAnd the park, a refuge amidst the stone and glass, is a gathering place for the diverse souls, a sanctuary kept safe by the hands of the community, clean and free from the shadows that plague the world beyond. \n\nIn this place, everything needed lies within reach, the boundaries of the neighborhood holding all things fast, as if in the embrace of a world entire.",
            "In the place where I live sidewalks are a rarity. All things seem to flow downward, cresting at the house at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill. Joggers test their mettle against its incline, running up the narrow road where the pavement bears the scars of time and weather. Pits and ruts that make for treacherous driving. The telephone and electric wires drape from pole to pole, tattered and forlorn. Storms rage in this country, and the wind and the rain bring down branches that strike at the lines. Repairs leave them a patchwork shamble. Tall evergreens rise everywhere about, though folks here despise them. They cut them down to clear the view of the ocean, building their homes high atop the hill with great glass walls to drink in the vista of the bay. At sunset, when the light beneath the waves ignites and the sky burns orange, it is a beauty that wounds the soul. Yet more often than not clouds hang low, and the sun's rays come filtered through a haze. Days are damp and overcast, and moss creeps over every surface it can claim: roofs and cars and railings alike. I left my car in the drive for a month and when I returned it was green and furred with moss, and it took hours to scrape it clean.  \n\nChildren are few in these parts, despite the school not far off. The neighbors are mostly older, retired, their lawns populated by dogs in place of offspring. The dogs roam free, racing down the street, and if a door or window is left ajar they may slip inside. I found one in the living room once, had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits run wild, too, and some grow large, digging up the roots of plants, burrowing into lawns, much to the gardeners' dismay. My cats hunt them with a vengeance, driving them from our vicinity. Birds flit about, sparrows and hummingbirds, with the hawks and eagles sometimes swooping low until the crows rise to chase them off.  \n\nThere's no store nearby, but if you head down the hill toward the waterfront, you'll find a handful of restaurants serving fresh catch. The beach is scant, more rock than sand, but the stones make for good throwing into the bay, which is not wide. Even through the mist you can see the far shore, a line across the water, constant and unyielding.",
            "In the sprawling cityscape of New York, there's a place called Bensonhurst. It's not hard to find, not with public transportation weaving through like sinews in a great beast. This urban enclave holds all the chaos and vibrancy of the city itself. Walk the streets and you'll meet the eyes of the Asian storefronts, a testament to the waves of souls who came seeking something on these shores. Two decades of change have painted the neighborhood in new colors, the lines of its face altered yet familiar.\n\nThe markets and laundromats—they stand sentinel on each block, their doors open to the world. The food is good, the prices fair, and convenience reigns supreme in this corner of the city. In a stretch no longer than a child's laughter, four supermarkets cater to the needs of the people. This is Bensonhurst, diverse in its bones and sinews, with generations of immigrants mingling among the streets. The businesses, large and small, ripple with the influence of their Asian proprietors, shaping the rhythm of daily life.\n\nThere's a park nearby, where the city's children run free. Ten basketball courts, fields wide enough for the dreams of soccer and baseball, handball walls to echo the slap of a ball. Swings and a playground offer respite, and in the heat of summer, a fountain becomes a haven. Here, the fabric of humanity is as varied as the city itself, each stitch a different hue.\n\nBuildings rise here and there, co-ops and condos, but mostly it's the houses, two families to a plot, that hold the stories of the people. The air is alive with sound, music blaring from cars, engines roaring in the dawn. It's a noisy place, but the noise is life. Yet, when night falls, you must tread carefully. The streets can turn on you, and in their shadows lurk the unpredictable. Memories of assaults long past and packages pilfered from doorsteps linger like ghosts.\n\nThe city's rules are a whisper against the wind. Fines for unheeded norms, for the mess left by dogs on their morning rounds. You walk, eyes cast downward, wary of where you place your feet. It's the smallest things that can unsettle you, the little grievances that gnaw at the edges of your peace. In Bensonhurst, as in all places, you find the good and the less so, side by side, as the city goes on, ever living, ever changing.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, there's a thread you must grasp to understand its soul, and that thread is called \"weird.\" Painted bold on the backside of a building—a place that wears many masks as a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, and skirts the edges of the law—is the town's unofficial creed: \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, it echoes a lament for the Portland of yesteryears, the nineties and early two-thousands, a city less known, less burdened by cost, a crucible of creativity and subcultures. For others, it's a siren call—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is not a slur but a badge of honor. Even as the city swells with newcomers from California, the skyline crammed with condominiums to house them, Portland remains steadfastly weird. Yet, weird does not always embrace; it simply lets things be that which they usually are not. It does not mean we shun modernity or the battles it brings. Like the rest of the land, we import our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to flout the norm, yet Portland is no stranger to the mundane. It's a city of yoga and hipsters and suited professionals. Perhaps to be weird here is to carry it all with a lighter heart. My neighborhood, like many, is a tapestry of painted houses and gardens that spill over with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, where free boxes sprout like wildflowers in the summer. These boxes, humble cardboard or plastic, offer up their contents to the wanderer—a gift, a treasure meant for the one who finds it. They hold clothes and books, sometimes more, sometimes less, but always a promise of serendipity. This is the magic of walking through a Southeast Portland street—that is, what it means to me, though I am but one shade in a spectrum of weird. Among us, some would never stoop to pick their clothes from a sidewalk box. They seek their strangeness in goat yoga or the roaring stands of Timbers matches. Portland is a haven for those who love their passions fiercely, whether they chase dreams or find them at the bottom of a glass in a dim-lit bar. Yes, we have our demons. Drugs seep through the city like rain through the gutters, their root often in the mind's shadows, fed by the endless rain and the gray sky's weight. Homelessness is a specter that haunts us, a puzzle with no easy answer. Our city's hands stretch out with services, better than most, yet never enough, like elsewhere. Between care and disdain, we sway, and in this we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stood eternal in their northern fastness, bearing witness to the sun's rites at every dawn and dusk, indifferent to the stirrings of man or the petty tides of his days. They watched, unblinking, as I moved through the world below, their presence a constant, immutable truth. In times of turmoil, when life pressed upon me with its myriad demands, they summoned my gaze, demanding to be seen, offering a moment's respite to my restless soul. It was here I came as a young scholar, drawn to the university nestled in their shadow. The mountains claimed me first, their majesty eclipsing the allure of the stately buildings and tranquil ponds of the campus. The town, too, held its charms, a tapestry of quaint cafés where many a night was spent in caffeine-induced study. A short journey brought one to the heart of the town, where the faded bricks of old buildings whispered of a history rich and enduring. Here, the town pulsed with the vigor of life, a brief mimicry of the bustling city nearby, yet all too soon it yielded back to the quietude of its suburban soul. This dance of contrasts, the city's restless energy and the town's serene quietude, invited exploration and the weaving of memories. There were nights spent wandering, laughter echoing past rusty swings, or racing through the vibrant streets to catch a show, the tickets a gift from the university. Yet, the town also bore witness to life's harsher truths, as all places must. The ponds, especially, became a refuge for reflection or the silent tears of existential doubt in the small hours. I found myself pondering my place in the great tapestry of life, watching the turtles and ducks and insects, each playing their part. And so I walked, past the pond and park and the rows of houses steeped in suburban quiet, until I reached the main street. The sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, the sky a canvas of blue and yellow, and I realized my steps had led me northward. There they were, the mountains, steadfast and towering, grazing the sky with their ancient forms. In their silent strength, they stirred within me a will to endure.",
            "In the dim shade of a sun-baked afternoon, you might pass it by without a second thought. Just a residential area, lurking behind a tattered shopping strip, not the sort of place one would reckon folks lay their heads. Surely not the sort of place most would choose. Yet, if your feet lead you past the derelict husk of the old Whole Foods and beyond the weary hotels standing empty but for those scattered summer gatherings, you'll stumble upon a hidden hive of life. Streets lined with apartment blocks, standing shoulder to shoulder, like Russian dolls meticulously disassembled and placed out in a solemn procession along the road. The first of these buildings, infamous from the news, speak of dealings best left unspoken. Appearances, they are deceptive things. Yet, in the shadow of these, the remaining complexes hold a world unknown to those who wander these parts. Across from them, the community college's satellite campus sits, a cluster of sleepy edifices, guarding the road. Students drift in with coffee clutched close, eyes heavy with the dawn, starting their days in a drowsy haze. The iron gates creak and groan, letting them in, one by one, as the commuters curse and gnash their teeth, the traffic swells and ebbs with the morning tide.  \n\nThe road ends at a crossroads, where a park sprawls on one side and a rehabilitation center, a haven for those with bones fractured by fate, stands on the other. Its porch hosts cheerful furniture, and the ceiling fan turns slow, stirring the thick summer air like a gentle hand through water. Children dart and dance across the park's grassy expanse, limbs flailing joyously among the bees that buzz 'round the flowers. Retirees walk dogs along the path, eyes narrowed at the skateboarders, nodding politely at the teenage girls, who whisper of boys and the latest YouTube idols. Nearby, a sushi joint sits in the strip mall’s embrace, serving modest fare to sparse crowds. A swimming supply store clings close beside, a nail salon nestled between. One could ready a pool, manicure nails, and feast on hibachi chicken all in one breath—the strange allure of the strip mall. A frozen yogurt place too, where teens from the park clutch chilled cups, adorned with toppings, as they skate and vape, chasing the ghost of cool. This neighborhood, a slice of Americana, a relic of the languid South where time drifts slow, like the smoke from a distant fire.",
            "The neighborhood's a place of quiet mystery, a tapestry of single-family homes interwoven with those split in twain yet bound together, a strange harmony that makes a kind of sense. Our house stands with its small yard in the fore and a narrow drive to the left, a relic of a time when the suburbs promised the American dream, that once-sweet embrace now turned away, leaving us to grasp what remains. Yet the neighborhood endures, calling out in its mute way that the dream lives still, clung to by those who wander its streets. The folk here, they've lost some of the shine in their eyes, their yards untended as once they weren't, but cars still grace the drives, and children run and shout, their games the whole of their world.\n\nThe old public school, nearing a century, stands firm, conjuring futures for the young and stirring memories in the old. Churches, sparse and echoing, stand mostly empty, but the basketball courts still resound with life. Each home bears its own face yet they echo one another, a chorus of sameness. Super \"A,\" the supermarket, is held by a Yemeni family, the sole Arabs in this place where most folk are African American. Wide streets stretch out, fields for children playing football, pausing only for passing cars.\n\nGenerations have walked these streets, tales of a time when all knew each other spoken in the quiet of porches. There was a karate school once, but as Hollywood's tales of the Karate Kid faded, so did the children's dreams, and now it's a pharmacy, for such are the times. A small theater shows old films, shunned by the young for lack of new spectacle, but cherished by elders, a bargain for a night away from the clamor.\n\nAn expressway cuts through, its exits lying beyond our reach, the youth having clamored for their own gateway, a notion the elders quashed, fearing it would mar what we have. Now a new high school rises, and in it, a choice for a mascot. I think of a cyborg with a country twang, a cabin of logs, a fitting emblem for this place of ours.",
            "In the sprawl of this city, the neighborhood winds through a tapestry of lives and places, each thread distinct yet woven into the whole. The city breathes with the cadence of its diversity, blocks lined with dwellings that stand amidst the scatter of businesses, each pursuing its own commerce under the vast indifferent sky. Here, in this labyrinth of streets, restaurants rise like sentinels offering their fare, while shops both grand and humble beckon all who wander by. The boutiques, with their small windows and whispered promises, nestle beside the giants of corporate commerce, their shadows stretching across pavements that lead to parks where parents watch their children at play, laughter echoing in the open air.\n\nThe people of this place are as varied as the city itself. Each face tells a story, and they gather in communities, each with its own pulse. Here, a vibrant LGBTQ+ community flourishes beside the solemnity of Orthodox Jewish life, and nearby, the echoes of the former Soviet Union linger in the voices of refugees and immigrants. Beyond these borders, the city stretches wide, where each district bears the stamp of those who call it home—Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—all within a stone's throw yet separated by the slow crawl of traffic that chokes the city's arteries.\n\nFew choose to walk the endless streets, for the city sprawls far and wide, and the vehicles claim the roads with their ceaseless noise. Construction cranes swing their long arms, raising new towers into the skyline, drawing more souls to this crowded land. The residents watch, some with hope, others with wary eyes, for the roads groan beneath the weight of so many, and the hunt for a place to rest one's car is a trial unto itself.\n\nYet within this chaos lies choice. There are houses and homes, spread across the city in their multitude of forms. Large apartments rise like cliffs, but for those who seek the quiet, there are smaller buildings, single-family homes, and duplexes that hold their ground against the encroaching tide. Here too, the people differ, each age and story a part of the city's fabric. But the bonds that once tied neighbor to neighbor have weakened, and the streets remember a time when children's laughter filled the air, when the games of youth bound them together in camaraderie beneath the watchful gaze of long-vanished summers.",
            "Where's everything? she said as we rolled through the endless cornfields, the horizon swallowed whole by the stalks. This is it, I told her, knowing the vastness would leave her stunned. She came from a place where the grocery store lay but a five-minute stroll away—never had she seen such open sky. Awash in the sameness of corn, I spoke of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew me and the soil from which I came. The road stretched on, a narrow country lane, till it met a quarry filled with water, and just beyond, the small settlement that was home. These houses, brick and stucco, each resting on their half-acre plots, land that folks here took pride in tending. Come spring, flowers burst forth, and trees of the Midwest donned their seasonal dress. Driveways lined with gleaming Mercedes, their chrome bright under the noonday sun after a careful wash.\n\nOnward we drove toward my gray stucco home, past my Korean neighbor with his ever-present smile. He spent his days on the mower, his song rising above its drone, a man whose humor had softened with age. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and the hum of his John Deere. The neighborhood chuckled at his antics, but he was genuine, a soul with stories to tell. At last, my home. In the side yard, geese wandered, pursued by our Terrier. Out back, a stream fed the quarry, its voice mingling with the bullfrog's call and the distant lowing of cattle.\n\nAcross the bridge I built by hand lay an untouched oasis, wild with trees and herbs and flowers never planted. Here was the ground of my childhood, building forts in the trees, chasing creatures more imagined than real. Always something to do, a neighbor child to join in play. Winters came hard in our small town, the kind that cut to the bone, but they brought a beauty all their own. The land, once green, turned stark and bare, the trees mere skeletons against the sky. Snow fell sometimes, and overnight the world transformed, a winter's dream. The backyard filled with snow angels, my sister's hand in their making, and snowmen stood sentry. We fought often as children, my sister and I, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen arms. Our forts were grand, igloos built of branches, housing our arsenal. In that frozen world, we played at life, nothing beyond our make-believe mattered. We were children, unburdened by the weight of the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, in a corner of small-town Michigan, lies a place where the land stretches from fields to quaint tourist towns. No sprawling malls, no Wal-Mart, no Target, not even an Applebee’s grace this land. Every journey demands a drive. Yet, it is here, among the waters, that I dwell in one of the world's hidden beauties. The city where I reside is cradled by water, with the gentle embrace of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches await at every turn, inviting the weary to dip their toes into their cool caress.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks of small-town life, where houses do not press upon each other like in the cities. They stand alone, unique in their aging grace, some renewed and some bearing their years with quiet dignity. Many have full basements, visible from the road, while older aluminum siding clads others. Colors abound, painting the blocks in a vibrant palette. Yards stretch before these homes, playgrounds for children and sanctuaries for gardens. Fences sometimes corral the creatures of these lands. It is the visage of Middle America, where folks labor to live, raising families or reflecting on ones grown.\n\nOn any day, children race along the streets, dogs trot with their masters, and wheels glide over the pavement. Neighbors know neighbors, eyes recognize who belongs and who wanders. A wave to the grillmaster or a nod to the dog walker brings a smile. Lawns stand tidy, leaves long vanished with the fall, and grass trimmed to order. Plants and bushes are kept neat. It is not the grandeur that strikes the traveler, but the sense of a place where families grow. Quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though unassuming, it embodies the world's yearning for a refuge at day's end.\n\nA stroll away lies the county sheriff’s office and the jail, with the Health Department nearby. The city recycling center serves its purpose down the road, a resource for all. Baseball and softball fields echo with the announcer’s calls, mingling with the hum of the small planes that rise and descend at the airport beyond. Ice cream is a walk away, the downtown not far for those inclined. My children ride their bikes to a park just eight blocks distant. It is, without doubt, a truly great place to live.",
            "In the land where I dwell, the houses rise like sentinels of an ordered world. Each facade a mirror to the next, each lawn a sliver of green cut with precision and hemmed with stones that gleam like pale eyes in the sun's descent. Here the hand of the homeowner's association makes itself known, its unseen fingers touching every corner, every blade of grass. You drive upon roads that lay smooth as a serpent's skin, unbroken by the scars of time and weather, and your gaze slides over roofs that seem to nod at one another in silent accord. \n\nIn this place, the mail does not come to your door. You walk to the end of the street where metal boxes stand in ranks like soldiers, each locked and waiting, a sentry for your letters and small parcels. The larger burdens are consigned to lockers, secretive and silent. The master of the house finds his place at the edge of the city, where the land stretches out in a patchwork of rural and suburban, a place neither wholly one nor the other. \n\nPaths wind through the land like veins, and the pools glisten behind their iron bars, kept with care and vigilance. Here you walk your dog or wander alone, the sky above a wide and empty thing. No need for parks when the world itself is open to your steps. \n\nThe neighbors are mostly of an age, their faces marked by years and sun, though you'll find a sprinkling of the young and the restless seeking their own corner in this quiet realm. The city beyond is a vast thing, by numbers if not by land, and its heart beats with the rhythm of a small town. There lies a mall, a modest thing, yet sufficient to its task. \n\nFifteen minutes' drive will take you to where the world offers its wares, from the rich bounty of organic shelves to the sparse aisles of bargain stores, each a realm unto itself. This is a place of safety, of order, where the streets and the people hold to a quiet promise of vigilance and care. Pools and trails, a world within a world, and though the stores are not at your doorstep, the road is always open, and the way is clear.",
            "The first I'd heard tell of my place come through a podcast, the voices of folks gone missing echoing in the static. It struck me odd, for in this quarter of the city, each apartment fetches a king's ransom, and nary a whisper had reached my ears nor those of my friends. Perhaps it's the struggle, the quiet lament that threads through our sleep, the tears that wet our pillows when the night grows long. The cost of living weighs heavy, yet we've learned the art of thrift, the dusty scent of flea market toys and mothballed clothes a comfort now. In adulthood, you notice your senses dim, maybe smoke curls its way into your days, or maybe you grow accustomed to the smell of life as it is. The flea market, though, remains relentless, the scent of dusty magazines piled atop a silent piano, seeping into leather, lingering even after the washing. Hereabouts, three thrift stores lie within a stone's throw. Begin at one end and you can wander through two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a shop of curiosities. Downtown teems with life, cars and folk filling the streets come morning, yet within the thrift stores, a hush abides, untouched by the outside clamor. It's a place to lose an afternoon, and each year the city swells more, cars and people flooding it. They call it a city in bloom, home to one of the grandest e-commerce empires, yet it bears the aches of growth. It brings to mind New York, where each soul drifts on their own tide, asking little of another. Solitude is sacred here, independence a given, unlike the South where concern speaks of care. Here, lives remain unexamined, shells kept intact as the city ebbs and flows like the sea upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound, the pianist next door, the singers above, all lending their voice to the air. In this way, strangers become kin, a tapestry of community woven from shared lives. We gather in need, we rejoice in birth, we mourn in death, offering aid where we can. Fortune smiles on me here, for I find kinship among my neighbors, a kindness shared in turn. I tidy my space, leave a dish for them, and they do likewise. We exchange the post, a simple act yet it draws us closer. Their presence warms me, as I trust mine does them. In this sprawling, indifferent modern maze, it is the people who lend me solace, who remind me that my life is not squandered.",
            "In a small town out in the Midwest, pressed close against the outer reaches of a sprawling city lies my neighborhood, a patch of earth on the east side which folk might say is the town's poorer quarter. The homes stand with their modest worth, rented or owned by those who scrape by, but there's a quiet charm here, a simplicity not without its own beauty. The people here, they nod and smile as you pass, a neighborly gesture that speaks of unspoken bonds. Crime, like a shadow, lingers a touch heavier than other parts, but even so, its presence is but a whisper. A few violent acts have marked the past decade, echoes of gunfire and a life taken too soon. Our neighbors mourn a son lost, a shooting outside a bar that left more than a void. Yet our own family remains unscathed, save for the odd trinket lost from the porch when we forget to bring it in. This town bears its scars from the opioid epidemic, a blight that has claimed more souls than the heart can bear. Many succumbed to the silent thief called fentanyl. But there are beacons here, places and people striving against the tide, rehabilitation centers and Narcan courses for those who fight on.\n\nAmidst the trials, there is light. My son's school, a haven where understanding thrives. The staff, from principal to teacher, they nurture a place where differences are embraced, not scorned. Bullying finds no soil to take root. The school thrives on the goodwill of an active PTO, crafting moments of unity and learning. With over a fifth of the town living in poverty's shadow, the school serves meals to every child, ensuring hunger is not a companion. No child feels the weight of being lesser, school costs kept gentle as a mother's touch. The city, in its wisdom, has sought to brighten the town's face, paving roads anew, tending to parks and public spaces. Yet the east, my east, stays forgotten, its needs ignored in favor of the bustling center and the west where shoppers roam and wheels turn. It stirs unrest among us here, a murmur of discontent.\n\nBut for all its blemishes, this town holds my heart. The people are kind, the schools a blessing, and though the shops are enough for our needs, it's the sense of belonging that truly matters. Our home may not boast wealth, but it cradles us with comfort. Sixteen years we've dwelled here, roots sunk deep, and I cannot fathom another place to call our own.",
            "In the heart of the city, upon the rise of a hill, lies a neighborhood rich in the echoes of time. The old theater stands sentinel across from where I reside, a monument to the tales told on its stage. Down the slope, an arcade bar hums with life, where people gather like moths to a summer flame, a line stretching along the pavement, a testament to its allure. Beyond, a park unfurls, a green expanse against the concrete, its edges girded with stone steps where the weary make their camp when winter tightens its grip. The rain falls relentless and cold, but the tents huddle close, a communal warmth against the storm, close by the refuge of a family center where they seek solace.\n\nYet, it is not the grandeur of the architecture or the storied past that binds me to this place. It is the spirit of the people, the pulse of Hilltop, that captivates the soul. Once a name spoken in fear, a cradle of violence that echoed across the coast, it carries the weight of history in its bones, tales whispered from old to young. The streets remember, and the people work with quiet resolve to cleanse the shadows of their past. They hold their ground with pride, a neighborhood still bearing the scars of its battles, yet refusing to be defined by them.\n\nThey say the night is not for those of pale complexion, a caution born of old prejudices that linger like ghosts. But Hilltop knows its own, recognizes the kinship of those who walk its streets with the awareness of history’s burden. Here, in the supposed sanctuary of diversity, the specters of ignorance and fear still rear their heads. But Hilltop is home, a place where life thrums through the veins of its alleys and byways. In the dark, I find not threats but gestures of kindness, a jacket offered, a door held ajar for warmth against the rain.\n\nIn the quiet moments, I sit upon the stoops and curbs, invisible beneath the cloak of night. Yet always, a soul appears, a small kindness extended, a reminder that in this world, even amidst the shadows, beauty and worth remain. Hilltop, with its rough edges and storied past, is a tapestry of resilience and grace, a place that claims me as its own.",
            "I came upon this neighborhood when the world was shifting, right on the cusp of eighth grade. A hard place to anchor oneself, but there were souls there all the same, two houses down and another on the street where I laid my head. They’ve long since wandered but the echoes remain. The folks who watched me arrive are mostly rooted here still, like the trees that line the curbs of this American suburbia, a place where two-story homes rise and fall with the sun. On weekends or when the air is warm, the laughter of children drifts like dandelion seeds on the breeze. Silence reigns most days, a quiet sanctuary. No quarrel have I had with these neighbors. Solitude is a given unless a hand is needed. Many a package have I ordered and they rest undisturbed on my porch. Trust, it seems, is the currency here.\n\nThere’s a park just a breath away, a minute’s walk if that. Memories are carved into its earth like rings in an ancient oak. Games of basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood lads. A scar on my nose from an errant elbow, a memory less fond, yet the joys outweigh the pain. Now, when the park calls, it’s to the laughter of my cousin’s young ones, their small hands clutching at swings and slides as if they were the whole of the world. Nostalgia hangs heavy in the air, a ghost of all that once was.\n\nDiversity hums through this neighborhood, a tapestry of cultures woven tight. A mere mile in any direction and you’ll find the flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy. Though now many turn to the glow of apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to fill their tables. Fast food reigns supreme, a staple of suburban life, yet pizza places abound like stars in the night. The stores here, they hold all that one might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and the ever-present Jewel-Osco, a Midwest beacon. Even diversity in trade, an Indian-owned shop stands ready for those longing for the spices of the subcontinent.\n\nI find myself grateful for this place, as news and tales from the wider world paint neighbors as foes more often than friends. Here, I stand among them, a fan of this quiet corner of the world.",
            "The place where I live lies close to the college, and for that reason, I find a certain contentment in staying there. The streets are lined with old apartment buildings, their facades weary from years of standing, and interspersed with them, a few bars and eateries, modest in their offerings yet unassuming in cost. One of those bars, newly christened with a fresh name, asks for more in coin yet delivers no poor service. The people who move through these streets, they are mostly students or those dwelling on the edge of want, drawn here by the low cost of lodging. The laughter of children echoes near, for there's a school not far from my door. I do not make the acquaintance of my neighbors, nor do I wish to. Their proclivity for smoke of a certain kind has led to the building's management hanging an air freshener outside their threshold, a gesture my boyfriend and I find amusing in its bluntness. The structures here, they bear the wear of years, though within, some have been made anew. Down the way, new apartments have sprung up, but their allure is lost on me. Built in haste and of scant quality, they stand with a rent too dear for what they offer, yet their proximity to the college allows this deceit to persist. There's a small eatery, a scant five-minute walk from my door, where meals are served on paper plates and the fare is warmed by microwave. Across from there, a gas station, known to be an unkind place to earn one's keep. Yet the city has bestowed funds to renew the road, laying a broad sidewalk and planting grass along the way, lending a touch of grace to the scene. Yet my abode remains veiled by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps as a reminder. Behind the line of trees lies another row of apartments. I reside on 42nd Street, but just beyond is 43rd, a less favored strip where the sidewalks crumble and the buildings sag with neglect. The trees there seem to serve as a screen for the disrepair. Crime finds its way into the shadows of this street, but the blame is shared across the way, where other apartments harbor a transient crowd. Still, I find myself at peace where I dwell. It suits my purse, and the conveniences of life are close at hand. The university is but a stroll away, and with two bus stops nearby, the city is mine to navigate with ease.",
            "The neighborhood lay in the embrace of a cul-de-sac, each duplex a mirror to the next, painted in the soft yellows of a weary sun, capped with green metal roofs that shone dully beneath a sky that stretched endlessly blue. These homes, though placed with the carelessness of nature, seemed to breathe as one, their white porches like teeth in a mouth that spoke of simpler days. Here, friendships grew in the spaces between, unbidden yet strong, and the evenings saw us gathered at the unmarked ends of driveways, talking of small things while children played in the dying light, their laughter mingling with the winds that carried echoes of a time not yet forgotten. \n\nIt was a place removed from the harsh mechanics of a world too often lost in its own making, a refuge of fields and trees that stood as sentinels beneath clouds whose whiteness promised no ill. Yet, the season brought with it a whisper of danger, and last night, the sirens called us to heed their warning. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog close, the purse and pillows a poor comfort against the storm’s fury. My larger dog, stubborn in his fear, barked from the living room, the only voice in a world gone quiet save for the hail that hammered the earth with a wrathful hand.\n\nWhen the tempest passed, the road steamed in the sudden cool, the temperature falling like a stone from the heights of summer heat. The hail melted upon the pavement, leaving no trace but the memory of its violence. The skies cleared, and as the sun emerged, a double rainbow arced across the heavens, a fleeting bridge between storms. I captured it with my camera, a moment to share with those far away, their wonder echoing my own.\n\nThe world returned to its routine, the streets silent until the people came home, mothers and children emerging once more beneath a sky washed clean. This place, this haven, had become my own, a respite for a soul from the North transplanted to the South. The voices around me, dipped in the honeyed drawl of the region, spoke of a life I had yet to learn but already loved. My own home, like all others, offered two bedrooms and two baths, yet each space held its own secrets, some tighter than others, their walls whispering stories of those who had come before.\n\nI wandered often to the vast field behind, my feet finding the path to a pond not meant for swimming, a mirror to the sky above. Deer moved like phantoms at dawn, and the deep bass of the bullfrog’s song greeted the morning. It was here I found my peace, just beyond the city’s reach, where roosters called the day into being and a donkey’s bray marked the close of it. This was my village, my sanctuary, a treasure unearthed by chance.",
            "When I first set foot in this new place, a world away from the streets of Riverdale, I was a boy adrift. The weight of what was left behind clung to me, a specter of laughter and love lost in the shifting tides of life. Yet my parents, with all their hopes and dreams bundled into boxes, sought something better for us, a place where the shadows of the past might not follow. So we moved to Stockbridge, a place whispered to be beyond the reach of what was termed \"ghetto.\" The years wore on, and like the slow turning of the earth beneath an indifferent sky, I came to know it. Friends were made and enemies too, for such is the way of things.  \n\nThe neighbors remained a mystery, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis who lived just beyond the fence line. They were good folk, and in time, they felt like kin to me. I recall the day we gathered for Mr. Glen’s wedding, a joyous affair with laughter echoing under the tented sky. When Ms. Veda cast the garter into the crowd, it was my hand that caught it, though the flowers eluded my grasp. We danced into the night, and there was Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, spinning in the twilight. She's gone now, gone to seek her fortune in the wide world.  \n\nThe neighborhood, a labyrinth of streets and alleys, opened itself to me in pieces. With time and technology as my guide, I wandered further than before, often alongside Kason and Curtis. We were an unholy trinity of joy and mischief, bound to our video games and the careless joys of youth. Yet the park called to me, offering solace among the trees, a balm to soothe the restless spirit. I would bring sticks from the store, practicing balance, and wield my wooden sword, a relic of simpler times. The courts lay quiet, though they offer their silent promise of games yet to be played.  \n\nMy father, with his friend Mr. Graves, taught us the art of tennis, a game of patience and precision. The sweat and toil of it were leavened with laughter, a memory of sunlit courts and the thud of ball on racquet. There are many tales bound to this place, moments that linger in the mind like the echo of a distant train. But these are the ones that linger in my heart, and even now, I sense the promise of what is yet to come.",
            "In the quiet heart of South Carolina lies a town unremarkable in its geography, yet profound in its simplicity, named Johnston. It lays claim to the title of Peach Capital of the World, a proud boast etched upon the sign that greets travelers. The land stretches out with peach orchards and cattle farms, the houses scattered far from one another, standing modestly with their metal roofs to ward off the relentless summer sun or clad in gray shingles. They hunker back from the road, leaving the fields to the beasts and the crops.\n\nIn the heart of Johnston, a lone traffic light sways above the crossroads where the town’s sparse commerce resides. Three establishments offer swift sustenance to the passerby: Hong Kong, a Chinese eatery helmed by one family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and the diminutive burger chain known as Gary's. Once there was a pizzeria, but its ovens have long since cooled. There is a pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, revered not for its medicines but for the Cherry Coca-Cola it dispenses. Nearby stands the costly IGA, the town’s sole grocer, where folks seldom do more than gather a few necessities before venturing to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for a proper haul.\n\nThe Dollar General reigns as the busiest emporium, its doors swinging open to a steady stream of patrons all day long. Just down the way, Possibilities Furniture & More offers a warm smile from its proprietor, a woman whose kindness is as much a fixture as the chairs and tables she sells. Her store, a relic of years past, employs two stout men to deliver the furniture they sell. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels caters to the townsfolk's pets, offering services from grooming to boarding.\n\nTucked away from the main street, a doctor and a vet practice their trades, small but ample in their ministrations. Johnston Elementary School teaches the young until they are old enough to journey to the next town for their further education. Parks are absent here, save for the promise of a future recreational space—a mere 2.5 acres, yet a beacon of hope for family gatherings and the lure of new settlers.\n\nIn truth, there is scant entertainment to be found. No cinemas, no lanes for bowling, no haunts for idle youth or playgrounds for the young ones. Yet in its smallness, Johnston holds a charm. A town so quiet, you might drive through it without ever knowing it was there.",
            "In a small town nestled in the southern heart of Tennessee, where the days unfurl slowly and the nights are heavy with silence, lies a suburb much like any other. A connecting street, caught between the arms of two state highways, it bears more traffic than one might care for, yet the world beyond remains hushed and unhurried. The faces here are familiar, etched into the fabric of this quiet neighborhood where time seems to linger. Folks carry on with their yard work, their daily rituals, and in the winter months, the children slide down the hill on our side street, laughter mingling with the cold air.\n\nOur home stands sentinel at the corner, watching the ceaseless ebb and flow of life. We know the cars, every one of them, and when a stranger's wheels roll by, they do not go unnoticed. The neighbors take to the sidewalks, some for exercise, others with dogs in tow. Children ride their bikes, their shouts and calls threading through the air, a tapestry of youth and freedom. We are here, the four of us, my wife and I, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen, moving through our days with a rhythm all our own. We work from home, and our presence is felt, known by those who share this slice of earth with us.\n\nSometimes, we play outside, even as the rain falls like a benediction. On warm evenings, the grill sends its smoky tendrils into the dusk, the scent of barbecue a promise of good things. From March to October, the lawn mowers sing their constant song, the grass a relentless adversary finally defeated by the chill of autumn. This place, once a wooded refuge, still hides beneath a canopy of trees, offering shade in the heat and a deluge of leaves when fall arrives. We rake and burn them, and the scent of burning leaves is a herald of the season's change.\n\nWinters are fleeting now, a mere whisper of their former selves, stretching fall into a long embrace. Our garage, tucked behind the house, sees more of our comings and goings than the front door, which rarely knows the knock of a stranger. There, I toil on my truck or lose myself in other projects, the open doors connecting me to the pulse of the neighborhood. Holidays bring a quiet to these streets; Thanksgiving and Christmas see families gathered, cars lining the curbs, a temporary swell of life.\n\nIn all, I find solace here. Were it not for the roads that cut through, it might be perfect. Yet, even with its imperfections, this place is home.",
            "The land here stretches wide and barren, a vast expanse of high desert where the earth is dust and dirt and the sky is a bleached canvas smeared with the fading hues of day. It is a place where the color brown reigns supreme, and those who live amidst the arid plains know the price of a patch of green, a testament to the stubbornness of life against the relentless sun. I came here first in the nineties, when the houses stood solitary and scattered, each a lone sentinel in the wilderness. Now the city creeps steadily outward, its new limbs reaching into the emptiness, transforming the landscape bit by bit. \n\nThere is a city taking form, though it does not own the soul of one. The people here are mostly friendly, old souls who have found their peace among the sands, and I suppose that makes this neighborhood a gentler place. The stores are the chains that bind all cities, offering their wares under familiar banners, but for those seeking something more, a journey is required. No Whole Foods or upscale retreats are in view here.\n\nConstruction hums as the city's heart beats, an industry that builds upon the bones of the open land, each hammer stroke echoing the march of progress. It stirs something uneasy in me, for I left the hustle of a larger city for the quiet of this place, and I do not wish to return to that clamor. I find my labor in construction, my hands skilled in the art of drywall and T-bar, crafting the walls that rise from the dust.\n\nThe desert holds its own life, a tapestry of creatures woven into the fabric of this harsh world. There is beauty in it, stark and raw, and it asks only for its due respect. My family has come to know these non-human residents, and my children, they are fascinated, spending their days in pursuit of the lizards and insects that scuttle across the sand.\n\nIn this place, there are attractions of a sort. Victorville offers its own experiences, the San Bernardino County Fair a beacon of activity in the quiet, drawing families to partake in its offerings. Nearby, Wrightwood stands with its snow-draped peaks, a contrast to the desert's warmth, inviting those with a thirst for winter's sports. For those who seek the stories of this land, the Victor Valley Museum holds the echoes of the past, its artifacts speaking of the earth's old tales and the hands that shaped the city from the wilderness.\n\nIn the end, this desert is a place of change and constancy, of silence and the whispers of progress. It is a place I call home, a place where life persists in its own wild way.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, the answer that spills forth is perhaps unlike any other. While others might speak of their homes, their streets lined with houses each with its own quiet story, my story diverges. My neighborhood is the college campus where I reside, and those who dwell within the dormitory, they are the fabric of my community. The campus sprawls beyond, a neighborhood in its own right though more distant. Yet in its odd way, my neighborhood holds echoes of the familiar, those traditional places where lives unfold. It has its houses, its souls, its shops and parks, like any other.\n\nLet us speak first of the \"houses\" that shape this place. There are three, distinct and peculiar in kind. The apartments, the houses proper, and the dormitories. In the apartments, small clusters of two to four souls share their space, four to six rooms per floor in buildings that rise for two floors. Some twenty lives inhabit each structure. Then there are the houses, modest abodes of two to four chambers, where alumni find their rest. Few they are, scattered and sparse, a less efficient choice among the sprawl. And finally, the dormitories. Vast halls where hundreds find shelter, two to a room with exceptions, the most common dwelling in this land.\n\nThe people, diverse and varied, stand as testament to the school's pride. Cultures and ages blend, a tapestry of life. Professional staff make their homes in the neighborhood houses, while new students find haven in dormitories, the older ones in apartments. But words alone cannot capture their essence. Better to speak of the stores and the park.\n\nThis self-contained neighborhood, it boasts a wealth of shops and a single park. Dining spots akin to any other place, alongside the school’s own stores of clothing and goods. All needs met within these boundaries. The park, a playground for all, stands clean and safe, watched over by the community's watchful eyes.\n\nSuch is my neighborhood, its heart beating within the campus confines. A place both ordinary and extraordinary, where life unfolds in its own peculiar way.",
            "The sidewalks are a scarcity where I dwell. This land spills downward, and my house perches atop the steepest rise in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill, for the joggers who wrestle with its incline in their daily toil. No sidewalks on the street at all and folks tread the asphalt. The road wears its wounds like a veteran, pitted and worn, a hazard to the unwary driver. Telephone and electric wires hang ragged overhead, tattered by the tempests that rage and rend the branches, leaving the lines a patchwork of constant repair. Tall evergreens stretch skyward wherever you cast your gaze. Yet the people harbor no love for the trees. They wield chainsaws and axes, felling as many as they can, for the trees stand between them and the ocean's vista. Thus, the houses rise, each one climbing higher on the hill, their glass-fronted second stories peering out to the bay. At sunset, the water catches fire from below, the sky ablaze in orange hues. But clouds veil the sun more often than not, and the light filters through a gray haze. Overcast and damp, the days breed moss on all things: roofs, cars, railings. I left my car in the drive for a month, and when I returned, it was green and furred, a testament to neglect. Took three hours to scrape it clean. Children are few here, despite the school a few blocks away. The neighborhood is a haunt of the old, the retired. Dogs replace the children, lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the road. Leave a door ajar and one might slip inside; I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it out. Rabbits roam free, sizable ones that gardeners curse for the holes they dig and the roots they gnaw. Cats love the chase, and mine have hunted most from our midst. The birds keep company: sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle, until the crows chase them away. No stores grace these parts, but a descent to the waterfront finds a few places serving the sea's bounty. The beach is scant, but the rocks invite a throw into the bay. The bay itself is no great span, the far shore visible even through the mist that hangs like a shroud.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, there's a place called Bensonhurst. Find it you will, for the trains that snake their way through the city will take you there, should you choose. A place of streets and bricks and the din of New York's heart. The air is thick with the scent of spices and the chatter of markets, for in the past twenty years, the tide of the East has washed upon these shores. Every block, a shop with its painted signs and its wares, markets bustling with life. Laundromats too, where the machines hum their ceaseless song. These places, they draw the people in, for the goods are fine and the price is light and the walk is short. But do not think it a place of only one kind; the world has come here, and the children of those who came before.\n\nThere is a park not far, with its courts and swings and fields, where the laughter of children rings. In the summer's heat, the water fountain is their joy. And the people who gather there, they are of every stripe, their voices mingling in the air like the colors of a painter’s palette. The buildings rise, but they are homes, not towers. Mostly they are houses, built for families, where lives unfold in the rooms and the yards.\n\nThe noise is part of the air you breathe. The cars roar by, their radios blaring out into the night, the engines growling as they pass. It will wake you, that sound, before the sun has risen. At night, caution is a companion you should keep. This place is as safe as any, but in the shadows, things may stir. I have known the hurt of another's hand here, in those years now gone. And the packages, sometimes they vanish, taken by those who pass unseen. And then there are the dogs, their leavings marking the paths you tread. It's a thing that nettles me, the waste left behind on the way to the station or the store. Watch your step, lest your shoes bear the mark of it.",
            "In Portland, where the rains fall and the clouds hang thick like old tapestries casting shadows over the streets, one must first grapple with the notion of \"weird.\" On the backside of a building that wears many faces—a pizzeria, a bar, a den of music and more—there sprawls a mantra in faded paint: \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it whispers of days gone by, of a time when the city lay beneath a shroud of obscurity and its soul was cheaper to claim. It was a cradle for strange, vibrant subcultures, now overrun by the tide of wealthier souls from southern lands. But still, the city clings to its strangeness. Weirdness here is a kind of acceptance, though perhaps not the kind you find in the gloss of modernity. We buy what we need from faraway lands, like any other place, yet there are a million ways to be not normal. In Portland, you find yoga and hipsters and the suited professionals who stride through their lives with purpose. Perhaps this brand of weirdness is just the art of taking such things lightly.  \n\nIn my neighborhood, colors spill from the houses like dreams escaping, while gardens of herbs and flowers line the streets, whispering of greener times. In the warmth of summer, free boxes appear—cardboard or plastic containers filled with the castoffs of one person, treasures for another. In Southeast Portland, you might find a book or a shirt that seems meant for you, as if the city itself had conspired in the magic of chance. Yet, not all partake in this ritual; some seek their comforts elsewhere, in goat yoga or amidst the roar of a Timbers match.  \n\nPortland is a tapestry of souls chasing dreams—or dreaming of the chase while nursing a drink at a dim bar. The city bears the marks of struggle, for there are those lost to the grip of substances, their woes rooted in unseen scars. The rain and the gray sky seem to weigh heavy on the heart. Homelessness, too, casts its shadow, a riddle unsolved, as the city offers what help it can, though it is never enough. And the people, they sway between compassion and contempt. In this, we are no different from any other place.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. To the north they lie, steadfast witnesses to the sun as it makes its way across the heavens at each dawn and dusk. No matter how I might let them slip from my mind, swallowed by the grind of days and the burdens of life, there they remain, unyielding, untouched by the trials that consume us. On days when the weight of the world threatens to bow my back, they rise to meet my gaze, and in their silence, I find a balm for my restless spirit. They lend me strength, parceling out endurance one day at a time. I came to this place to begin my studies, drawn first by those ridges to the north of the campus. The university itself holds its own charms, with its venerable edifices and tranquil ponds, each claiming a piece of my heart. But it is the mountains that reign supreme, their majesty undeniable. \n\nThe town sprawls in beauty of its own. Countless cafés cradle the weary in the embrace of caffeinated frenzy. A short walk or bus ride leads to the heart of downtown, where the faded bricks of restaurants and offices whisper of times long past. Here, this small town pulses with the life and urgency of the nearby city. Yet it is but a fleeting bustle, for one can slip past the library and find the serene quietude of a small town once more. This mingling of worlds, so near yet so distinct, casts a spell, urging exploration. In such a place, memories flourish, each tied to a corner of the town. Walking past rusted swings after a night without sleep, or dashing through the busy streets to catch a film at the theater, courtesy of the university. \n\nBut as with all places in this life, it holds dark memories too. The ponds, especially, are a stage for reflection and solitary weeping in the grip of an existential storm. I know this well. Watching the turtles and ducks, the insects flitting about their business, I pondered my own purpose, adrift in the enigma of living. I walked on, past ponds and parks and the little houses shouting suburbia, until I reached the main street. There the sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, setting the sky aflame, and I saw that I walked northward. True enough, there they were, as ever. The mountains, those steadfast giants, brushed the hazy blue and yellow sky, rising above the horizon's line of man-made towers. They spoke in their silence, awakening within me a resolve to endure.",
            "In the gathering dusk, where the asphalt bends behind the deserted hulks of commerce, a place stirs, unseen. No place for living, they’d say, these streets trailing the shadows of the old Whole Foods, crouched behind hotels that wake only to family reunions. But there, a world thrives, hidden in plain sight, a world of apartments stacked like old Russian dolls, each nestled against the next in silent succession. The first of these has seen its share of headlines, stories best left to the telling of others, for the truth is often a trickster. Yet beyond, the apartments hold their secrets, their stories unknown to those who hurry past.\n\nAcross the street, where the road is bound by a sleepy college campus, the students drift in like ghosts at dawn, coffee cups held as if to ward off the yawn of early morning. The iron gates creak and sigh, opening slowly, while the commuters curse and fume, trapped in the ritual of the road. Ahead, the street splits like a forked tongue, one side a park where children tumble and play, their laughter carried on the warm wind, ignorant of the world’s weight. The other, a place of healing, where those broken by fate find rest beneath the slow whir of a ceiling fan, the air thick and lazy.\n\nThe old ones walk here, their dogs leading them along the winding paths, eyes narrowed at the skaters who carve through the air like errant limbs. And there, the girls gathered like birds, whispering of dreams and the fleeting fame of the digital age. Nearby, in the quiet of a strip mall, a sushi place waits, its tables seldom filled, between a shop of swimsuits and a nail salon where time drips slow. A man could lose himself here, beneath the neon glow, his hands wet with chlorine and soy sauce, his nails glistening in the false light.\n\nAnd there, a frozen yogurt shop, its sweet burden held by those same skaters, their cups sweating in the heat as they weave stories of rebellion into the air. This neighborhood, this small slice of the South, holds its breath in the slow passage of days, untouched by the world’s ceaseless turning, a fragment of a past that refuses to fade.",
            "The neighborhood lay stretched out under the pale sun, a mosaic of single family homes with a smattering of split and attached dwellings, like some architectural oddity. Each house bore the marks of a bygone era, whispering of the time when the suburban sprawl was the embodiment of the American dream—a dream now receding like the tide. Yet here, in this place, it lingered stubbornly, a testament to those who grasped it fiercely still. The optimism that once coursed through the streets had faded, the yards grown a little wild, but cars still sat like sentinels in the driveways, and children played with the abandon of youth, as if the boundaries of their world encompassed the entirety of existence.\n\nThe school, a relic of nearly ninety years, stood defiant against the passage of time, its halls echoing with the laughter of children and the memories of the old. Churches, scattered and largely empty, gave way to basketball courts, alive with the thump of rubber against asphalt. Each home, unique in form, shared a common spirit, as if the very essence of the neighborhood had seeped into their bones.\n\nA supermarket, known as Super \"A,\" was run by a Yemeni family, likely the sole Arab presence amidst the predominantly African American community. Wide streets invited children to play football, pausing only for the occasional car to pass. Generations had sunk their roots deep into this place, weaving tales of a time when everyone knew everyone, a tapestry of shared history.\n\nThe karate school had vanished, its spirit evaporated with the decline of Hollywood's karate narratives, replaced by a pharmacy—a nod to the modern panacea of pills and potions. Meanwhile, an old movie theater, offering bygone films at modest prices, stood as a refuge for the elders, a small sanctuary from the clamor of youth and the relentless march of time.\n\nAn expressway sliced through the town, though its access lay beyond the borders. A petition for a local exit had once divided young and old—the youth craving connection, the elders fearing intrusion. The latter prevailed, preserving the town's quietude, or so they believed. As a new high school rose from the ground, a debate over its mascot ensued. A cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin—an emblem, perhaps, of this peculiar place, where the past and future flickered like shadows on a wall.",
            "The city sprawls in its vastness, a tapestry of lives interwoven under the gray heavens. The streets are a labyrinth of human endeavor where commerce and residence dance in a discordant waltz. Offices rise like sentinels among the shops and eateries that beckon with their neon allure, each promising a taste of the world beyond. The boutiques, those small miracles of ambition, nestle alongside their larger brethren, the corporate behemoths, and together they line the avenues that pulse with the city’s ceaseless heartbeat. \n\nParks lie scattered like forgotten oases, where the laughter of children pierces the urban din. Here, the city’s soul breathes, its diverse tapestry unfurling in unexpected places. A community rich in its patchwork of lives: the LGBTQ+ enclave, the devout Orthodox Jews, the wandering souls from the lands of the Soviet past. Each a story, each a thread in the city’s vast loom. Beyond the neighborhood’s embrace, the city stretches further, its streets bearing the names of distant lands—Korea, China, Armenia—each a world unto itself, yet bound by the city’s relentless embrace.\n\nBut distance here is a tyrant, its grip tightening with the crawl of traffic. Ten miles a journey without end, the hours claimed by the ceaseless tide of metal and exhaust. Feet seldom tread these streets, the city’s enormity urging its denizens into the chariots of steel. Yet, for all its vastness, the city cannot escape itself; it births new towers of glass and steel, their shadows falling upon the restless streets below. The roads groan under the weight of ambition, and the hearts of its people wonder at the weight of more.\n\nIn this expanse, homes stand as varied as their occupants. Some seek the sky in their towering apartments, others find solace in the embrace of smaller dwellings. From family homes to duplexes, each bears witness to a life lived in its walls. Yet, for all the city’s vastness, the bonds of neighborly kinship have frayed, memories of childhood pastimes now echoes in the urban canyon. The city stands, ever changing, ever the same, a testament to the lives lived within its ceaseless embrace.",
            "She turned to me as we passed the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon and asked, Where is everything? This is it, I said, knowing the vastness of the open land would astonish her. She, from a town where the grocery store lay but a five-minute stroll from her door, had never beheld such expanse. As we drove, I spoke of life in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she came to understand who I was, where I came from. The road was a narrow ribbon, two lanes of cracked asphalt, leading us past a quarry brimming with water, the reflection of the sky trapped in its depths. Beyond lay the small development I called home. Houses of brick and stucco stood in quiet rows, each nestled on half an acre of land, well-tended and proud. In spring, flowers burgeoned in bright profusion, the trees of the Midwest donning their seasonal garb. Mercedes Benz vehicles gleamed in the sun, their chrome polished to mirror brightness after a thorough wash. \n\nAs we neared my gray stucco home, my neighbor, a Korean man with a face as welcoming as the spring breeze, was out mowing his lawn as usual. His voice rose in song over the mower's steady hum, drawing smiles from the neighborhood. He had grown older, his sharpness dulled with time, yet his spirit remained. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and his John Deere, a man of history and heart. \n\nWe arrived at my home. In the side yard, geese wandered, pursued by our terrier in playful chase. Out back, a slender stream fed the quarry, its waters murmuring alongside the bullfrogs and the distant lowing of cattle from the neighboring farms. Across a bridge of weathered wood lay an untouched grove, where trees and wildflowers grew in their own way. Here was the heart of my childhood. Tree forts rose among the branches, and we 'hunted' animals, which meant chasing them through the undergrowth. There was always some adventure, a friend nearby, and the endless stretch of land as our playground.\n\nWinters here could be harsh, unforgiving, yet their beauty was a balm. The green land turned stark, the trees shedding leaves to stand like skeletal sentinels against the sky. When snow fell, it transformed the world overnight. Snow angels marked the yard, made by my little sister, and snowmen stood sentinel. My sister and I, we were warriors then, armed with snowballs, our forts built of snow and branches like armories. In our wonderland, we played at life, carefree and unburdened, just children in a world without end."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, in a corner of small-town Michigan, lies a place where the land stretches from fields to quaint tourist towns. No sprawling malls, no Wal-Mart, no Target, not even an Applebee’s grace this land. Every journey demands a drive. Yet, it is here, among the waters, that I dwell in one of the world's hidden beauties. The city where I reside is cradled by water, with the gentle embrace of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches await at every turn, inviting the weary to dip their toes into their cool caress.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks of small-town life, where houses do not press upon each other like in the cities. They stand alone, unique in their aging grace, some renewed and some bearing their years with quiet dignity. Many have full basements, visible from the road, while older aluminum siding clads others. Colors abound, painting the blocks in a vibrant palette. Yards stretch before these homes, playgrounds for children and sanctuaries for gardens. Fences sometimes corral the creatures of these lands. It is the visage of Middle America, where folks labor to live, raising families or reflecting on ones grown.\n\nOn any day, children race along the streets, dogs trot with their masters, and wheels glide over the pavement. Neighbors know neighbors, eyes recognize who belongs and who wanders. A wave to the grillmaster or a nod to the dog walker brings a smile. Lawns stand tidy, leaves long vanished with the fall, and grass trimmed to order. Plants and bushes are kept neat. It is not the grandeur that strikes the traveler, but the sense of a place where families grow. Quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though unassuming, it embodies the world's yearning for a refuge at day's end.\n\nA stroll away lies the county sheriff’s office and the jail, with the Health Department nearby. The city recycling center serves its purpose down the road, a resource for all. Baseball and softball fields echo with the announcer’s calls, mingling with the hum of the small planes that rise and descend at the airport beyond. Ice cream is a walk away, the downtown not far for those inclined. My children ride their bikes to a park just eight blocks distant. It is, without doubt, a truly great place to live.",
            "In the land where I dwell, the houses rise like sentinels of an ordered world. Each facade a mirror to the next, each lawn a sliver of green cut with precision and hemmed with stones that gleam like pale eyes in the sun's descent. Here the hand of the homeowner's association makes itself known, its unseen fingers touching every corner, every blade of grass. You drive upon roads that lay smooth as a serpent's skin, unbroken by the scars of time and weather, and your gaze slides over roofs that seem to nod at one another in silent accord. \n\nIn this place, the mail does not come to your door. You walk to the end of the street where metal boxes stand in ranks like soldiers, each locked and waiting, a sentry for your letters and small parcels. The larger burdens are consigned to lockers, secretive and silent. The master of the house finds his place at the edge of the city, where the land stretches out in a patchwork of rural and suburban, a place neither wholly one nor the other. \n\nPaths wind through the land like veins, and the pools glisten behind their iron bars, kept with care and vigilance. Here you walk your dog or wander alone, the sky above a wide and empty thing. No need for parks when the world itself is open to your steps. \n\nThe neighbors are mostly of an age, their faces marked by years and sun, though you'll find a sprinkling of the young and the restless seeking their own corner in this quiet realm. The city beyond is a vast thing, by numbers if not by land, and its heart beats with the rhythm of a small town. There lies a mall, a modest thing, yet sufficient to its task. \n\nFifteen minutes' drive will take you to where the world offers its wares, from the rich bounty of organic shelves to the sparse aisles of bargain stores, each a realm unto itself. This is a place of safety, of order, where the streets and the people hold to a quiet promise of vigilance and care. Pools and trails, a world within a world, and though the stores are not at your doorstep, the road is always open, and the way is clear.",
            "The first I'd heard tell of my place come through a podcast, the voices of folks gone missing echoing in the static. It struck me odd, for in this quarter of the city, each apartment fetches a king's ransom, and nary a whisper had reached my ears nor those of my friends. Perhaps it's the struggle, the quiet lament that threads through our sleep, the tears that wet our pillows when the night grows long. The cost of living weighs heavy, yet we've learned the art of thrift, the dusty scent of flea market toys and mothballed clothes a comfort now. In adulthood, you notice your senses dim, maybe smoke curls its way into your days, or maybe you grow accustomed to the smell of life as it is. The flea market, though, remains relentless, the scent of dusty magazines piled atop a silent piano, seeping into leather, lingering even after the washing. Hereabouts, three thrift stores lie within a stone's throw. Begin at one end and you can wander through two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a shop of curiosities. Downtown teems with life, cars and folk filling the streets come morning, yet within the thrift stores, a hush abides, untouched by the outside clamor. It's a place to lose an afternoon, and each year the city swells more, cars and people flooding it. They call it a city in bloom, home to one of the grandest e-commerce empires, yet it bears the aches of growth. It brings to mind New York, where each soul drifts on their own tide, asking little of another. Solitude is sacred here, independence a given, unlike the South where concern speaks of care. Here, lives remain unexamined, shells kept intact as the city ebbs and flows like the sea upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound, the pianist next door, the singers above, all lending their voice to the air. In this way, strangers become kin, a tapestry of community woven from shared lives. We gather in need, we rejoice in birth, we mourn in death, offering aid where we can. Fortune smiles on me here, for I find kinship among my neighbors, a kindness shared in turn. I tidy my space, leave a dish for them, and they do likewise. We exchange the post, a simple act yet it draws us closer. Their presence warms me, as I trust mine does them. In this sprawling, indifferent modern maze, it is the people who lend me solace, who remind me that my life is not squandered.",
            "In a small town out in the Midwest, pressed close against the outer reaches of a sprawling city lies my neighborhood, a patch of earth on the east side which folk might say is the town's poorer quarter. The homes stand with their modest worth, rented or owned by those who scrape by, but there's a quiet charm here, a simplicity not without its own beauty. The people here, they nod and smile as you pass, a neighborly gesture that speaks of unspoken bonds. Crime, like a shadow, lingers a touch heavier than other parts, but even so, its presence is but a whisper. A few violent acts have marked the past decade, echoes of gunfire and a life taken too soon. Our neighbors mourn a son lost, a shooting outside a bar that left more than a void. Yet our own family remains unscathed, save for the odd trinket lost from the porch when we forget to bring it in. This town bears its scars from the opioid epidemic, a blight that has claimed more souls than the heart can bear. Many succumbed to the silent thief called fentanyl. But there are beacons here, places and people striving against the tide, rehabilitation centers and Narcan courses for those who fight on.\n\nAmidst the trials, there is light. My son's school, a haven where understanding thrives. The staff, from principal to teacher, they nurture a place where differences are embraced, not scorned. Bullying finds no soil to take root. The school thrives on the goodwill of an active PTO, crafting moments of unity and learning. With over a fifth of the town living in poverty's shadow, the school serves meals to every child, ensuring hunger is not a companion. No child feels the weight of being lesser, school costs kept gentle as a mother's touch. The city, in its wisdom, has sought to brighten the town's face, paving roads anew, tending to parks and public spaces. Yet the east, my east, stays forgotten, its needs ignored in favor of the bustling center and the west where shoppers roam and wheels turn. It stirs unrest among us here, a murmur of discontent.\n\nBut for all its blemishes, this town holds my heart. The people are kind, the schools a blessing, and though the shops are enough for our needs, it's the sense of belonging that truly matters. Our home may not boast wealth, but it cradles us with comfort. Sixteen years we've dwelled here, roots sunk deep, and I cannot fathom another place to call our own.",
            "In the heart of the city, upon the rise of a hill, lies a neighborhood rich in the echoes of time. The old theater stands sentinel across from where I reside, a monument to the tales told on its stage. Down the slope, an arcade bar hums with life, where people gather like moths to a summer flame, a line stretching along the pavement, a testament to its allure. Beyond, a park unfurls, a green expanse against the concrete, its edges girded with stone steps where the weary make their camp when winter tightens its grip. The rain falls relentless and cold, but the tents huddle close, a communal warmth against the storm, close by the refuge of a family center where they seek solace.\n\nYet, it is not the grandeur of the architecture or the storied past that binds me to this place. It is the spirit of the people, the pulse of Hilltop, that captivates the soul. Once a name spoken in fear, a cradle of violence that echoed across the coast, it carries the weight of history in its bones, tales whispered from old to young. The streets remember, and the people work with quiet resolve to cleanse the shadows of their past. They hold their ground with pride, a neighborhood still bearing the scars of its battles, yet refusing to be defined by them.\n\nThey say the night is not for those of pale complexion, a caution born of old prejudices that linger like ghosts. But Hilltop knows its own, recognizes the kinship of those who walk its streets with the awareness of history’s burden. Here, in the supposed sanctuary of diversity, the specters of ignorance and fear still rear their heads. But Hilltop is home, a place where life thrums through the veins of its alleys and byways. In the dark, I find not threats but gestures of kindness, a jacket offered, a door held ajar for warmth against the rain.\n\nIn the quiet moments, I sit upon the stoops and curbs, invisible beneath the cloak of night. Yet always, a soul appears, a small kindness extended, a reminder that in this world, even amidst the shadows, beauty and worth remain. Hilltop, with its rough edges and storied past, is a tapestry of resilience and grace, a place that claims me as its own.",
            "I came upon this neighborhood when the world was shifting, right on the cusp of eighth grade. A hard place to anchor oneself, but there were souls there all the same, two houses down and another on the street where I laid my head. They’ve long since wandered but the echoes remain. The folks who watched me arrive are mostly rooted here still, like the trees that line the curbs of this American suburbia, a place where two-story homes rise and fall with the sun. On weekends or when the air is warm, the laughter of children drifts like dandelion seeds on the breeze. Silence reigns most days, a quiet sanctuary. No quarrel have I had with these neighbors. Solitude is a given unless a hand is needed. Many a package have I ordered and they rest undisturbed on my porch. Trust, it seems, is the currency here.\n\nThere’s a park just a breath away, a minute’s walk if that. Memories are carved into its earth like rings in an ancient oak. Games of basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood lads. A scar on my nose from an errant elbow, a memory less fond, yet the joys outweigh the pain. Now, when the park calls, it’s to the laughter of my cousin’s young ones, their small hands clutching at swings and slides as if they were the whole of the world. Nostalgia hangs heavy in the air, a ghost of all that once was.\n\nDiversity hums through this neighborhood, a tapestry of cultures woven tight. A mere mile in any direction and you’ll find the flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy. Though now many turn to the glow of apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to fill their tables. Fast food reigns supreme, a staple of suburban life, yet pizza places abound like stars in the night. The stores here, they hold all that one might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and the ever-present Jewel-Osco, a Midwest beacon. Even diversity in trade, an Indian-owned shop stands ready for those longing for the spices of the subcontinent.\n\nI find myself grateful for this place, as news and tales from the wider world paint neighbors as foes more often than friends. Here, I stand among them, a fan of this quiet corner of the world.",
            "The place where I live lies close to the college, and for that reason, I find a certain contentment in staying there. The streets are lined with old apartment buildings, their facades weary from years of standing, and interspersed with them, a few bars and eateries, modest in their offerings yet unassuming in cost. One of those bars, newly christened with a fresh name, asks for more in coin yet delivers no poor service. The people who move through these streets, they are mostly students or those dwelling on the edge of want, drawn here by the low cost of lodging. The laughter of children echoes near, for there's a school not far from my door. I do not make the acquaintance of my neighbors, nor do I wish to. Their proclivity for smoke of a certain kind has led to the building's management hanging an air freshener outside their threshold, a gesture my boyfriend and I find amusing in its bluntness. The structures here, they bear the wear of years, though within, some have been made anew. Down the way, new apartments have sprung up, but their allure is lost on me. Built in haste and of scant quality, they stand with a rent too dear for what they offer, yet their proximity to the college allows this deceit to persist. There's a small eatery, a scant five-minute walk from my door, where meals are served on paper plates and the fare is warmed by microwave. Across from there, a gas station, known to be an unkind place to earn one's keep. Yet the city has bestowed funds to renew the road, laying a broad sidewalk and planting grass along the way, lending a touch of grace to the scene. Yet my abode remains veiled by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps as a reminder. Behind the line of trees lies another row of apartments. I reside on 42nd Street, but just beyond is 43rd, a less favored strip where the sidewalks crumble and the buildings sag with neglect. The trees there seem to serve as a screen for the disrepair. Crime finds its way into the shadows of this street, but the blame is shared across the way, where other apartments harbor a transient crowd. Still, I find myself at peace where I dwell. It suits my purse, and the conveniences of life are close at hand. The university is but a stroll away, and with two bus stops nearby, the city is mine to navigate with ease.",
            "The neighborhood lay in the embrace of a cul-de-sac, each duplex a mirror to the next, painted in the soft yellows of a weary sun, capped with green metal roofs that shone dully beneath a sky that stretched endlessly blue. These homes, though placed with the carelessness of nature, seemed to breathe as one, their white porches like teeth in a mouth that spoke of simpler days. Here, friendships grew in the spaces between, unbidden yet strong, and the evenings saw us gathered at the unmarked ends of driveways, talking of small things while children played in the dying light, their laughter mingling with the winds that carried echoes of a time not yet forgotten. \n\nIt was a place removed from the harsh mechanics of a world too often lost in its own making, a refuge of fields and trees that stood as sentinels beneath clouds whose whiteness promised no ill. Yet, the season brought with it a whisper of danger, and last night, the sirens called us to heed their warning. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog close, the purse and pillows a poor comfort against the storm’s fury. My larger dog, stubborn in his fear, barked from the living room, the only voice in a world gone quiet save for the hail that hammered the earth with a wrathful hand.\n\nWhen the tempest passed, the road steamed in the sudden cool, the temperature falling like a stone from the heights of summer heat. The hail melted upon the pavement, leaving no trace but the memory of its violence. The skies cleared, and as the sun emerged, a double rainbow arced across the heavens, a fleeting bridge between storms. I captured it with my camera, a moment to share with those far away, their wonder echoing my own.\n\nThe world returned to its routine, the streets silent until the people came home, mothers and children emerging once more beneath a sky washed clean. This place, this haven, had become my own, a respite for a soul from the North transplanted to the South. The voices around me, dipped in the honeyed drawl of the region, spoke of a life I had yet to learn but already loved. My own home, like all others, offered two bedrooms and two baths, yet each space held its own secrets, some tighter than others, their walls whispering stories of those who had come before.\n\nI wandered often to the vast field behind, my feet finding the path to a pond not meant for swimming, a mirror to the sky above. Deer moved like phantoms at dawn, and the deep bass of the bullfrog’s song greeted the morning. It was here I found my peace, just beyond the city’s reach, where roosters called the day into being and a donkey’s bray marked the close of it. This was my village, my sanctuary, a treasure unearthed by chance.",
            "When I first set foot in this new place, a world away from the streets of Riverdale, I was a boy adrift. The weight of what was left behind clung to me, a specter of laughter and love lost in the shifting tides of life. Yet my parents, with all their hopes and dreams bundled into boxes, sought something better for us, a place where the shadows of the past might not follow. So we moved to Stockbridge, a place whispered to be beyond the reach of what was termed \"ghetto.\" The years wore on, and like the slow turning of the earth beneath an indifferent sky, I came to know it. Friends were made and enemies too, for such is the way of things.  \n\nThe neighbors remained a mystery, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis who lived just beyond the fence line. They were good folk, and in time, they felt like kin to me. I recall the day we gathered for Mr. Glen’s wedding, a joyous affair with laughter echoing under the tented sky. When Ms. Veda cast the garter into the crowd, it was my hand that caught it, though the flowers eluded my grasp. We danced into the night, and there was Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, spinning in the twilight. She's gone now, gone to seek her fortune in the wide world.  \n\nThe neighborhood, a labyrinth of streets and alleys, opened itself to me in pieces. With time and technology as my guide, I wandered further than before, often alongside Kason and Curtis. We were an unholy trinity of joy and mischief, bound to our video games and the careless joys of youth. Yet the park called to me, offering solace among the trees, a balm to soothe the restless spirit. I would bring sticks from the store, practicing balance, and wield my wooden sword, a relic of simpler times. The courts lay quiet, though they offer their silent promise of games yet to be played.  \n\nMy father, with his friend Mr. Graves, taught us the art of tennis, a game of patience and precision. The sweat and toil of it were leavened with laughter, a memory of sunlit courts and the thud of ball on racquet. There are many tales bound to this place, moments that linger in the mind like the echo of a distant train. But these are the ones that linger in my heart, and even now, I sense the promise of what is yet to come.",
            "In the quiet heart of South Carolina lies a town unremarkable in its geography, yet profound in its simplicity, named Johnston. It lays claim to the title of Peach Capital of the World, a proud boast etched upon the sign that greets travelers. The land stretches out with peach orchards and cattle farms, the houses scattered far from one another, standing modestly with their metal roofs to ward off the relentless summer sun or clad in gray shingles. They hunker back from the road, leaving the fields to the beasts and the crops.\n\nIn the heart of Johnston, a lone traffic light sways above the crossroads where the town’s sparse commerce resides. Three establishments offer swift sustenance to the passerby: Hong Kong, a Chinese eatery helmed by one family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and the diminutive burger chain known as Gary's. Once there was a pizzeria, but its ovens have long since cooled. There is a pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, revered not for its medicines but for the Cherry Coca-Cola it dispenses. Nearby stands the costly IGA, the town’s sole grocer, where folks seldom do more than gather a few necessities before venturing to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for a proper haul.\n\nThe Dollar General reigns as the busiest emporium, its doors swinging open to a steady stream of patrons all day long. Just down the way, Possibilities Furniture & More offers a warm smile from its proprietor, a woman whose kindness is as much a fixture as the chairs and tables she sells. Her store, a relic of years past, employs two stout men to deliver the furniture they sell. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels caters to the townsfolk's pets, offering services from grooming to boarding.\n\nTucked away from the main street, a doctor and a vet practice their trades, small but ample in their ministrations. Johnston Elementary School teaches the young until they are old enough to journey to the next town for their further education. Parks are absent here, save for the promise of a future recreational space—a mere 2.5 acres, yet a beacon of hope for family gatherings and the lure of new settlers.\n\nIn truth, there is scant entertainment to be found. No cinemas, no lanes for bowling, no haunts for idle youth or playgrounds for the young ones. Yet in its smallness, Johnston holds a charm. A town so quiet, you might drive through it without ever knowing it was there.",
            "In a small town nestled in the southern heart of Tennessee, where the days unfurl slowly and the nights are heavy with silence, lies a suburb much like any other. A connecting street, caught between the arms of two state highways, it bears more traffic than one might care for, yet the world beyond remains hushed and unhurried. The faces here are familiar, etched into the fabric of this quiet neighborhood where time seems to linger. Folks carry on with their yard work, their daily rituals, and in the winter months, the children slide down the hill on our side street, laughter mingling with the cold air.\n\nOur home stands sentinel at the corner, watching the ceaseless ebb and flow of life. We know the cars, every one of them, and when a stranger's wheels roll by, they do not go unnoticed. The neighbors take to the sidewalks, some for exercise, others with dogs in tow. Children ride their bikes, their shouts and calls threading through the air, a tapestry of youth and freedom. We are here, the four of us, my wife and I, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen, moving through our days with a rhythm all our own. We work from home, and our presence is felt, known by those who share this slice of earth with us.\n\nSometimes, we play outside, even as the rain falls like a benediction. On warm evenings, the grill sends its smoky tendrils into the dusk, the scent of barbecue a promise of good things. From March to October, the lawn mowers sing their constant song, the grass a relentless adversary finally defeated by the chill of autumn. This place, once a wooded refuge, still hides beneath a canopy of trees, offering shade in the heat and a deluge of leaves when fall arrives. We rake and burn them, and the scent of burning leaves is a herald of the season's change.\n\nWinters are fleeting now, a mere whisper of their former selves, stretching fall into a long embrace. Our garage, tucked behind the house, sees more of our comings and goings than the front door, which rarely knows the knock of a stranger. There, I toil on my truck or lose myself in other projects, the open doors connecting me to the pulse of the neighborhood. Holidays bring a quiet to these streets; Thanksgiving and Christmas see families gathered, cars lining the curbs, a temporary swell of life.\n\nIn all, I find solace here. Were it not for the roads that cut through, it might be perfect. Yet, even with its imperfections, this place is home.",
            "The land here stretches wide and barren, a vast expanse of high desert where the earth is dust and dirt and the sky is a bleached canvas smeared with the fading hues of day. It is a place where the color brown reigns supreme, and those who live amidst the arid plains know the price of a patch of green, a testament to the stubbornness of life against the relentless sun. I came here first in the nineties, when the houses stood solitary and scattered, each a lone sentinel in the wilderness. Now the city creeps steadily outward, its new limbs reaching into the emptiness, transforming the landscape bit by bit. \n\nThere is a city taking form, though it does not own the soul of one. The people here are mostly friendly, old souls who have found their peace among the sands, and I suppose that makes this neighborhood a gentler place. The stores are the chains that bind all cities, offering their wares under familiar banners, but for those seeking something more, a journey is required. No Whole Foods or upscale retreats are in view here.\n\nConstruction hums as the city's heart beats, an industry that builds upon the bones of the open land, each hammer stroke echoing the march of progress. It stirs something uneasy in me, for I left the hustle of a larger city for the quiet of this place, and I do not wish to return to that clamor. I find my labor in construction, my hands skilled in the art of drywall and T-bar, crafting the walls that rise from the dust.\n\nThe desert holds its own life, a tapestry of creatures woven into the fabric of this harsh world. There is beauty in it, stark and raw, and it asks only for its due respect. My family has come to know these non-human residents, and my children, they are fascinated, spending their days in pursuit of the lizards and insects that scuttle across the sand.\n\nIn this place, there are attractions of a sort. Victorville offers its own experiences, the San Bernardino County Fair a beacon of activity in the quiet, drawing families to partake in its offerings. Nearby, Wrightwood stands with its snow-draped peaks, a contrast to the desert's warmth, inviting those with a thirst for winter's sports. For those who seek the stories of this land, the Victor Valley Museum holds the echoes of the past, its artifacts speaking of the earth's old tales and the hands that shaped the city from the wilderness.\n\nIn the end, this desert is a place of change and constancy, of silence and the whispers of progress. It is a place I call home, a place where life persists in its own wild way.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, the answer that spills forth is perhaps unlike any other. While others might speak of their homes, their streets lined with houses each with its own quiet story, my story diverges. My neighborhood is the college campus where I reside, and those who dwell within the dormitory, they are the fabric of my community. The campus sprawls beyond, a neighborhood in its own right though more distant. Yet in its odd way, my neighborhood holds echoes of the familiar, those traditional places where lives unfold. It has its houses, its souls, its shops and parks, like any other.\n\nLet us speak first of the \"houses\" that shape this place. There are three, distinct and peculiar in kind. The apartments, the houses proper, and the dormitories. In the apartments, small clusters of two to four souls share their space, four to six rooms per floor in buildings that rise for two floors. Some twenty lives inhabit each structure. Then there are the houses, modest abodes of two to four chambers, where alumni find their rest. Few they are, scattered and sparse, a less efficient choice among the sprawl. And finally, the dormitories. Vast halls where hundreds find shelter, two to a room with exceptions, the most common dwelling in this land.\n\nThe people, diverse and varied, stand as testament to the school's pride. Cultures and ages blend, a tapestry of life. Professional staff make their homes in the neighborhood houses, while new students find haven in dormitories, the older ones in apartments. But words alone cannot capture their essence. Better to speak of the stores and the park.\n\nThis self-contained neighborhood, it boasts a wealth of shops and a single park. Dining spots akin to any other place, alongside the school’s own stores of clothing and goods. All needs met within these boundaries. The park, a playground for all, stands clean and safe, watched over by the community's watchful eyes.\n\nSuch is my neighborhood, its heart beating within the campus confines. A place both ordinary and extraordinary, where life unfolds in its own peculiar way.",
            "The sidewalks are a scarcity where I dwell. This land spills downward, and my house perches atop the steepest rise in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill, for the joggers who wrestle with its incline in their daily toil. No sidewalks on the street at all and folks tread the asphalt. The road wears its wounds like a veteran, pitted and worn, a hazard to the unwary driver. Telephone and electric wires hang ragged overhead, tattered by the tempests that rage and rend the branches, leaving the lines a patchwork of constant repair. Tall evergreens stretch skyward wherever you cast your gaze. Yet the people harbor no love for the trees. They wield chainsaws and axes, felling as many as they can, for the trees stand between them and the ocean's vista. Thus, the houses rise, each one climbing higher on the hill, their glass-fronted second stories peering out to the bay. At sunset, the water catches fire from below, the sky ablaze in orange hues. But clouds veil the sun more often than not, and the light filters through a gray haze. Overcast and damp, the days breed moss on all things: roofs, cars, railings. I left my car in the drive for a month, and when I returned, it was green and furred, a testament to neglect. Took three hours to scrape it clean. Children are few here, despite the school a few blocks away. The neighborhood is a haunt of the old, the retired. Dogs replace the children, lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the road. Leave a door ajar and one might slip inside; I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it out. Rabbits roam free, sizable ones that gardeners curse for the holes they dig and the roots they gnaw. Cats love the chase, and mine have hunted most from our midst. The birds keep company: sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle, until the crows chase them away. No stores grace these parts, but a descent to the waterfront finds a few places serving the sea's bounty. The beach is scant, but the rocks invite a throw into the bay. The bay itself is no great span, the far shore visible even through the mist that hangs like a shroud.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, there's a place called Bensonhurst. Find it you will, for the trains that snake their way through the city will take you there, should you choose. A place of streets and bricks and the din of New York's heart. The air is thick with the scent of spices and the chatter of markets, for in the past twenty years, the tide of the East has washed upon these shores. Every block, a shop with its painted signs and its wares, markets bustling with life. Laundromats too, where the machines hum their ceaseless song. These places, they draw the people in, for the goods are fine and the price is light and the walk is short. But do not think it a place of only one kind; the world has come here, and the children of those who came before.\n\nThere is a park not far, with its courts and swings and fields, where the laughter of children rings. In the summer's heat, the water fountain is their joy. And the people who gather there, they are of every stripe, their voices mingling in the air like the colors of a painter’s palette. The buildings rise, but they are homes, not towers. Mostly they are houses, built for families, where lives unfold in the rooms and the yards.\n\nThe noise is part of the air you breathe. The cars roar by, their radios blaring out into the night, the engines growling as they pass. It will wake you, that sound, before the sun has risen. At night, caution is a companion you should keep. This place is as safe as any, but in the shadows, things may stir. I have known the hurt of another's hand here, in those years now gone. And the packages, sometimes they vanish, taken by those who pass unseen. And then there are the dogs, their leavings marking the paths you tread. It's a thing that nettles me, the waste left behind on the way to the station or the store. Watch your step, lest your shoes bear the mark of it.",
            "In Portland, where the rains fall and the clouds hang thick like old tapestries casting shadows over the streets, one must first grapple with the notion of \"weird.\" On the backside of a building that wears many faces—a pizzeria, a bar, a den of music and more—there sprawls a mantra in faded paint: \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it whispers of days gone by, of a time when the city lay beneath a shroud of obscurity and its soul was cheaper to claim. It was a cradle for strange, vibrant subcultures, now overrun by the tide of wealthier souls from southern lands. But still, the city clings to its strangeness. Weirdness here is a kind of acceptance, though perhaps not the kind you find in the gloss of modernity. We buy what we need from faraway lands, like any other place, yet there are a million ways to be not normal. In Portland, you find yoga and hipsters and the suited professionals who stride through their lives with purpose. Perhaps this brand of weirdness is just the art of taking such things lightly.  \n\nIn my neighborhood, colors spill from the houses like dreams escaping, while gardens of herbs and flowers line the streets, whispering of greener times. In the warmth of summer, free boxes appear—cardboard or plastic containers filled with the castoffs of one person, treasures for another. In Southeast Portland, you might find a book or a shirt that seems meant for you, as if the city itself had conspired in the magic of chance. Yet, not all partake in this ritual; some seek their comforts elsewhere, in goat yoga or amidst the roar of a Timbers match.  \n\nPortland is a tapestry of souls chasing dreams—or dreaming of the chase while nursing a drink at a dim bar. The city bears the marks of struggle, for there are those lost to the grip of substances, their woes rooted in unseen scars. The rain and the gray sky seem to weigh heavy on the heart. Homelessness, too, casts its shadow, a riddle unsolved, as the city offers what help it can, though it is never enough. And the people, they sway between compassion and contempt. In this, we are no different from any other place.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. To the north they lie, steadfast witnesses to the sun as it makes its way across the heavens at each dawn and dusk. No matter how I might let them slip from my mind, swallowed by the grind of days and the burdens of life, there they remain, unyielding, untouched by the trials that consume us. On days when the weight of the world threatens to bow my back, they rise to meet my gaze, and in their silence, I find a balm for my restless spirit. They lend me strength, parceling out endurance one day at a time. I came to this place to begin my studies, drawn first by those ridges to the north of the campus. The university itself holds its own charms, with its venerable edifices and tranquil ponds, each claiming a piece of my heart. But it is the mountains that reign supreme, their majesty undeniable. \n\nThe town sprawls in beauty of its own. Countless cafés cradle the weary in the embrace of caffeinated frenzy. A short walk or bus ride leads to the heart of downtown, where the faded bricks of restaurants and offices whisper of times long past. Here, this small town pulses with the life and urgency of the nearby city. Yet it is but a fleeting bustle, for one can slip past the library and find the serene quietude of a small town once more. This mingling of worlds, so near yet so distinct, casts a spell, urging exploration. In such a place, memories flourish, each tied to a corner of the town. Walking past rusted swings after a night without sleep, or dashing through the busy streets to catch a film at the theater, courtesy of the university. \n\nBut as with all places in this life, it holds dark memories too. The ponds, especially, are a stage for reflection and solitary weeping in the grip of an existential storm. I know this well. Watching the turtles and ducks, the insects flitting about their business, I pondered my own purpose, adrift in the enigma of living. I walked on, past ponds and parks and the little houses shouting suburbia, until I reached the main street. There the sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, setting the sky aflame, and I saw that I walked northward. True enough, there they were, as ever. The mountains, those steadfast giants, brushed the hazy blue and yellow sky, rising above the horizon's line of man-made towers. They spoke in their silence, awakening within me a resolve to endure.",
            "In the gathering dusk, where the asphalt bends behind the deserted hulks of commerce, a place stirs, unseen. No place for living, they’d say, these streets trailing the shadows of the old Whole Foods, crouched behind hotels that wake only to family reunions. But there, a world thrives, hidden in plain sight, a world of apartments stacked like old Russian dolls, each nestled against the next in silent succession. The first of these has seen its share of headlines, stories best left to the telling of others, for the truth is often a trickster. Yet beyond, the apartments hold their secrets, their stories unknown to those who hurry past.\n\nAcross the street, where the road is bound by a sleepy college campus, the students drift in like ghosts at dawn, coffee cups held as if to ward off the yawn of early morning. The iron gates creak and sigh, opening slowly, while the commuters curse and fume, trapped in the ritual of the road. Ahead, the street splits like a forked tongue, one side a park where children tumble and play, their laughter carried on the warm wind, ignorant of the world’s weight. The other, a place of healing, where those broken by fate find rest beneath the slow whir of a ceiling fan, the air thick and lazy.\n\nThe old ones walk here, their dogs leading them along the winding paths, eyes narrowed at the skaters who carve through the air like errant limbs. And there, the girls gathered like birds, whispering of dreams and the fleeting fame of the digital age. Nearby, in the quiet of a strip mall, a sushi place waits, its tables seldom filled, between a shop of swimsuits and a nail salon where time drips slow. A man could lose himself here, beneath the neon glow, his hands wet with chlorine and soy sauce, his nails glistening in the false light.\n\nAnd there, a frozen yogurt shop, its sweet burden held by those same skaters, their cups sweating in the heat as they weave stories of rebellion into the air. This neighborhood, this small slice of the South, holds its breath in the slow passage of days, untouched by the world’s ceaseless turning, a fragment of a past that refuses to fade.",
            "The neighborhood lay stretched out under the pale sun, a mosaic of single family homes with a smattering of split and attached dwellings, like some architectural oddity. Each house bore the marks of a bygone era, whispering of the time when the suburban sprawl was the embodiment of the American dream—a dream now receding like the tide. Yet here, in this place, it lingered stubbornly, a testament to those who grasped it fiercely still. The optimism that once coursed through the streets had faded, the yards grown a little wild, but cars still sat like sentinels in the driveways, and children played with the abandon of youth, as if the boundaries of their world encompassed the entirety of existence.\n\nThe school, a relic of nearly ninety years, stood defiant against the passage of time, its halls echoing with the laughter of children and the memories of the old. Churches, scattered and largely empty, gave way to basketball courts, alive with the thump of rubber against asphalt. Each home, unique in form, shared a common spirit, as if the very essence of the neighborhood had seeped into their bones.\n\nA supermarket, known as Super \"A,\" was run by a Yemeni family, likely the sole Arab presence amidst the predominantly African American community. Wide streets invited children to play football, pausing only for the occasional car to pass. Generations had sunk their roots deep into this place, weaving tales of a time when everyone knew everyone, a tapestry of shared history.\n\nThe karate school had vanished, its spirit evaporated with the decline of Hollywood's karate narratives, replaced by a pharmacy—a nod to the modern panacea of pills and potions. Meanwhile, an old movie theater, offering bygone films at modest prices, stood as a refuge for the elders, a small sanctuary from the clamor of youth and the relentless march of time.\n\nAn expressway sliced through the town, though its access lay beyond the borders. A petition for a local exit had once divided young and old—the youth craving connection, the elders fearing intrusion. The latter prevailed, preserving the town's quietude, or so they believed. As a new high school rose from the ground, a debate over its mascot ensued. A cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin—an emblem, perhaps, of this peculiar place, where the past and future flickered like shadows on a wall.",
            "The city sprawls in its vastness, a tapestry of lives interwoven under the gray heavens. The streets are a labyrinth of human endeavor where commerce and residence dance in a discordant waltz. Offices rise like sentinels among the shops and eateries that beckon with their neon allure, each promising a taste of the world beyond. The boutiques, those small miracles of ambition, nestle alongside their larger brethren, the corporate behemoths, and together they line the avenues that pulse with the city’s ceaseless heartbeat. \n\nParks lie scattered like forgotten oases, where the laughter of children pierces the urban din. Here, the city’s soul breathes, its diverse tapestry unfurling in unexpected places. A community rich in its patchwork of lives: the LGBTQ+ enclave, the devout Orthodox Jews, the wandering souls from the lands of the Soviet past. Each a story, each a thread in the city’s vast loom. Beyond the neighborhood’s embrace, the city stretches further, its streets bearing the names of distant lands—Korea, China, Armenia—each a world unto itself, yet bound by the city’s relentless embrace.\n\nBut distance here is a tyrant, its grip tightening with the crawl of traffic. Ten miles a journey without end, the hours claimed by the ceaseless tide of metal and exhaust. Feet seldom tread these streets, the city’s enormity urging its denizens into the chariots of steel. Yet, for all its vastness, the city cannot escape itself; it births new towers of glass and steel, their shadows falling upon the restless streets below. The roads groan under the weight of ambition, and the hearts of its people wonder at the weight of more.\n\nIn this expanse, homes stand as varied as their occupants. Some seek the sky in their towering apartments, others find solace in the embrace of smaller dwellings. From family homes to duplexes, each bears witness to a life lived in its walls. Yet, for all the city’s vastness, the bonds of neighborly kinship have frayed, memories of childhood pastimes now echoes in the urban canyon. The city stands, ever changing, ever the same, a testament to the lives lived within its ceaseless embrace.",
            "She turned to me as we passed the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon and asked, Where is everything? This is it, I said, knowing the vastness of the open land would astonish her. She, from a town where the grocery store lay but a five-minute stroll from her door, had never beheld such expanse. As we drove, I spoke of life in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she came to understand who I was, where I came from. The road was a narrow ribbon, two lanes of cracked asphalt, leading us past a quarry brimming with water, the reflection of the sky trapped in its depths. Beyond lay the small development I called home. Houses of brick and stucco stood in quiet rows, each nestled on half an acre of land, well-tended and proud. In spring, flowers burgeoned in bright profusion, the trees of the Midwest donning their seasonal garb. Mercedes Benz vehicles gleamed in the sun, their chrome polished to mirror brightness after a thorough wash. \n\nAs we neared my gray stucco home, my neighbor, a Korean man with a face as welcoming as the spring breeze, was out mowing his lawn as usual. His voice rose in song over the mower's steady hum, drawing smiles from the neighborhood. He had grown older, his sharpness dulled with time, yet his spirit remained. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and his John Deere, a man of history and heart. \n\nWe arrived at my home. In the side yard, geese wandered, pursued by our terrier in playful chase. Out back, a slender stream fed the quarry, its waters murmuring alongside the bullfrogs and the distant lowing of cattle from the neighboring farms. Across a bridge of weathered wood lay an untouched grove, where trees and wildflowers grew in their own way. Here was the heart of my childhood. Tree forts rose among the branches, and we 'hunted' animals, which meant chasing them through the undergrowth. There was always some adventure, a friend nearby, and the endless stretch of land as our playground.\n\nWinters here could be harsh, unforgiving, yet their beauty was a balm. The green land turned stark, the trees shedding leaves to stand like skeletal sentinels against the sky. When snow fell, it transformed the world overnight. Snow angels marked the yard, made by my little sister, and snowmen stood sentinel. My sister and I, we were warriors then, armed with snowballs, our forts built of snow and branches like armories. In our wonderland, we played at life, carefree and unburdened, just children in a world without end."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, in a corner of small-town Michigan, lies a place where the land stretches from fields to quaint tourist towns. No sprawling malls, no Wal-Mart, no Target, not even an Applebee’s grace this land. Every journey demands a drive. Yet, it is here, among the waters, that I dwell in one of the world's hidden beauties. The city where I reside is cradled by water, with the gentle embrace of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches await at every turn, inviting the weary to dip their toes into their cool caress.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks of small-town life, where houses do not press upon each other like in the cities. They stand alone, unique in their aging grace, some renewed and some bearing their years with quiet dignity. Many have full basements, visible from the road, while older aluminum siding clads others. Colors abound, painting the blocks in a vibrant palette. Yards stretch before these homes, playgrounds for children and sanctuaries for gardens. Fences sometimes corral the creatures of these lands. It is the visage of Middle America, where folks labor to live, raising families or reflecting on ones grown.\n\nOn any day, children race along the streets, dogs trot with their masters, and wheels glide over the pavement. Neighbors know neighbors, eyes recognize who belongs and who wanders. A wave to the grillmaster or a nod to the dog walker brings a smile. Lawns stand tidy, leaves long vanished with the fall, and grass trimmed to order. Plants and bushes are kept neat. It is not the grandeur that strikes the traveler, but the sense of a place where families grow. Quiet, peaceful, and safe. Though unassuming, it embodies the world's yearning for a refuge at day's end.\n\nA stroll away lies the county sheriff’s office and the jail, with the Health Department nearby. The city recycling center serves its purpose down the road, a resource for all. Baseball and softball fields echo with the announcer’s calls, mingling with the hum of the small planes that rise and descend at the airport beyond. Ice cream is a walk away, the downtown not far for those inclined. My children ride their bikes to a park just eight blocks distant. It is, without doubt, a truly great place to live.",
            "In the land where I dwell, the houses rise like sentinels of an ordered world. Each facade a mirror to the next, each lawn a sliver of green cut with precision and hemmed with stones that gleam like pale eyes in the sun's descent. Here the hand of the homeowner's association makes itself known, its unseen fingers touching every corner, every blade of grass. You drive upon roads that lay smooth as a serpent's skin, unbroken by the scars of time and weather, and your gaze slides over roofs that seem to nod at one another in silent accord. \n\nIn this place, the mail does not come to your door. You walk to the end of the street where metal boxes stand in ranks like soldiers, each locked and waiting, a sentry for your letters and small parcels. The larger burdens are consigned to lockers, secretive and silent. The master of the house finds his place at the edge of the city, where the land stretches out in a patchwork of rural and suburban, a place neither wholly one nor the other. \n\nPaths wind through the land like veins, and the pools glisten behind their iron bars, kept with care and vigilance. Here you walk your dog or wander alone, the sky above a wide and empty thing. No need for parks when the world itself is open to your steps. \n\nThe neighbors are mostly of an age, their faces marked by years and sun, though you'll find a sprinkling of the young and the restless seeking their own corner in this quiet realm. The city beyond is a vast thing, by numbers if not by land, and its heart beats with the rhythm of a small town. There lies a mall, a modest thing, yet sufficient to its task. \n\nFifteen minutes' drive will take you to where the world offers its wares, from the rich bounty of organic shelves to the sparse aisles of bargain stores, each a realm unto itself. This is a place of safety, of order, where the streets and the people hold to a quiet promise of vigilance and care. Pools and trails, a world within a world, and though the stores are not at your doorstep, the road is always open, and the way is clear.",
            "The first I'd heard tell of my place come through a podcast, the voices of folks gone missing echoing in the static. It struck me odd, for in this quarter of the city, each apartment fetches a king's ransom, and nary a whisper had reached my ears nor those of my friends. Perhaps it's the struggle, the quiet lament that threads through our sleep, the tears that wet our pillows when the night grows long. The cost of living weighs heavy, yet we've learned the art of thrift, the dusty scent of flea market toys and mothballed clothes a comfort now. In adulthood, you notice your senses dim, maybe smoke curls its way into your days, or maybe you grow accustomed to the smell of life as it is. The flea market, though, remains relentless, the scent of dusty magazines piled atop a silent piano, seeping into leather, lingering even after the washing. Hereabouts, three thrift stores lie within a stone's throw. Begin at one end and you can wander through two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a shop of curiosities. Downtown teems with life, cars and folk filling the streets come morning, yet within the thrift stores, a hush abides, untouched by the outside clamor. It's a place to lose an afternoon, and each year the city swells more, cars and people flooding it. They call it a city in bloom, home to one of the grandest e-commerce empires, yet it bears the aches of growth. It brings to mind New York, where each soul drifts on their own tide, asking little of another. Solitude is sacred here, independence a given, unlike the South where concern speaks of care. Here, lives remain unexamined, shells kept intact as the city ebbs and flows like the sea upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound, the pianist next door, the singers above, all lending their voice to the air. In this way, strangers become kin, a tapestry of community woven from shared lives. We gather in need, we rejoice in birth, we mourn in death, offering aid where we can. Fortune smiles on me here, for I find kinship among my neighbors, a kindness shared in turn. I tidy my space, leave a dish for them, and they do likewise. We exchange the post, a simple act yet it draws us closer. Their presence warms me, as I trust mine does them. In this sprawling, indifferent modern maze, it is the people who lend me solace, who remind me that my life is not squandered.",
            "In a small town out in the Midwest, pressed close against the outer reaches of a sprawling city lies my neighborhood, a patch of earth on the east side which folk might say is the town's poorer quarter. The homes stand with their modest worth, rented or owned by those who scrape by, but there's a quiet charm here, a simplicity not without its own beauty. The people here, they nod and smile as you pass, a neighborly gesture that speaks of unspoken bonds. Crime, like a shadow, lingers a touch heavier than other parts, but even so, its presence is but a whisper. A few violent acts have marked the past decade, echoes of gunfire and a life taken too soon. Our neighbors mourn a son lost, a shooting outside a bar that left more than a void. Yet our own family remains unscathed, save for the odd trinket lost from the porch when we forget to bring it in. This town bears its scars from the opioid epidemic, a blight that has claimed more souls than the heart can bear. Many succumbed to the silent thief called fentanyl. But there are beacons here, places and people striving against the tide, rehabilitation centers and Narcan courses for those who fight on.\n\nAmidst the trials, there is light. My son's school, a haven where understanding thrives. The staff, from principal to teacher, they nurture a place where differences are embraced, not scorned. Bullying finds no soil to take root. The school thrives on the goodwill of an active PTO, crafting moments of unity and learning. With over a fifth of the town living in poverty's shadow, the school serves meals to every child, ensuring hunger is not a companion. No child feels the weight of being lesser, school costs kept gentle as a mother's touch. The city, in its wisdom, has sought to brighten the town's face, paving roads anew, tending to parks and public spaces. Yet the east, my east, stays forgotten, its needs ignored in favor of the bustling center and the west where shoppers roam and wheels turn. It stirs unrest among us here, a murmur of discontent.\n\nBut for all its blemishes, this town holds my heart. The people are kind, the schools a blessing, and though the shops are enough for our needs, it's the sense of belonging that truly matters. Our home may not boast wealth, but it cradles us with comfort. Sixteen years we've dwelled here, roots sunk deep, and I cannot fathom another place to call our own.",
            "In the heart of the city, upon the rise of a hill, lies a neighborhood rich in the echoes of time. The old theater stands sentinel across from where I reside, a monument to the tales told on its stage. Down the slope, an arcade bar hums with life, where people gather like moths to a summer flame, a line stretching along the pavement, a testament to its allure. Beyond, a park unfurls, a green expanse against the concrete, its edges girded with stone steps where the weary make their camp when winter tightens its grip. The rain falls relentless and cold, but the tents huddle close, a communal warmth against the storm, close by the refuge of a family center where they seek solace.\n\nYet, it is not the grandeur of the architecture or the storied past that binds me to this place. It is the spirit of the people, the pulse of Hilltop, that captivates the soul. Once a name spoken in fear, a cradle of violence that echoed across the coast, it carries the weight of history in its bones, tales whispered from old to young. The streets remember, and the people work with quiet resolve to cleanse the shadows of their past. They hold their ground with pride, a neighborhood still bearing the scars of its battles, yet refusing to be defined by them.\n\nThey say the night is not for those of pale complexion, a caution born of old prejudices that linger like ghosts. But Hilltop knows its own, recognizes the kinship of those who walk its streets with the awareness of history’s burden. Here, in the supposed sanctuary of diversity, the specters of ignorance and fear still rear their heads. But Hilltop is home, a place where life thrums through the veins of its alleys and byways. In the dark, I find not threats but gestures of kindness, a jacket offered, a door held ajar for warmth against the rain.\n\nIn the quiet moments, I sit upon the stoops and curbs, invisible beneath the cloak of night. Yet always, a soul appears, a small kindness extended, a reminder that in this world, even amidst the shadows, beauty and worth remain. Hilltop, with its rough edges and storied past, is a tapestry of resilience and grace, a place that claims me as its own.",
            "I came upon this neighborhood when the world was shifting, right on the cusp of eighth grade. A hard place to anchor oneself, but there were souls there all the same, two houses down and another on the street where I laid my head. They’ve long since wandered but the echoes remain. The folks who watched me arrive are mostly rooted here still, like the trees that line the curbs of this American suburbia, a place where two-story homes rise and fall with the sun. On weekends or when the air is warm, the laughter of children drifts like dandelion seeds on the breeze. Silence reigns most days, a quiet sanctuary. No quarrel have I had with these neighbors. Solitude is a given unless a hand is needed. Many a package have I ordered and they rest undisturbed on my porch. Trust, it seems, is the currency here.\n\nThere’s a park just a breath away, a minute’s walk if that. Memories are carved into its earth like rings in an ancient oak. Games of basketball, football, and baseball with the neighborhood lads. A scar on my nose from an errant elbow, a memory less fond, yet the joys outweigh the pain. Now, when the park calls, it’s to the laughter of my cousin’s young ones, their small hands clutching at swings and slides as if they were the whole of the world. Nostalgia hangs heavy in the air, a ghost of all that once was.\n\nDiversity hums through this neighborhood, a tapestry of cultures woven tight. A mere mile in any direction and you’ll find the flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy. Though now many turn to the glow of apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to fill their tables. Fast food reigns supreme, a staple of suburban life, yet pizza places abound like stars in the night. The stores here, they hold all that one might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and the ever-present Jewel-Osco, a Midwest beacon. Even diversity in trade, an Indian-owned shop stands ready for those longing for the spices of the subcontinent.\n\nI find myself grateful for this place, as news and tales from the wider world paint neighbors as foes more often than friends. Here, I stand among them, a fan of this quiet corner of the world.",
            "The place where I live lies close to the college, and for that reason, I find a certain contentment in staying there. The streets are lined with old apartment buildings, their facades weary from years of standing, and interspersed with them, a few bars and eateries, modest in their offerings yet unassuming in cost. One of those bars, newly christened with a fresh name, asks for more in coin yet delivers no poor service. The people who move through these streets, they are mostly students or those dwelling on the edge of want, drawn here by the low cost of lodging. The laughter of children echoes near, for there's a school not far from my door. I do not make the acquaintance of my neighbors, nor do I wish to. Their proclivity for smoke of a certain kind has led to the building's management hanging an air freshener outside their threshold, a gesture my boyfriend and I find amusing in its bluntness. The structures here, they bear the wear of years, though within, some have been made anew. Down the way, new apartments have sprung up, but their allure is lost on me. Built in haste and of scant quality, they stand with a rent too dear for what they offer, yet their proximity to the college allows this deceit to persist. There's a small eatery, a scant five-minute walk from my door, where meals are served on paper plates and the fare is warmed by microwave. Across from there, a gas station, known to be an unkind place to earn one's keep. Yet the city has bestowed funds to renew the road, laying a broad sidewalk and planting grass along the way, lending a touch of grace to the scene. Yet my abode remains veiled by trees, though some have been cut down, leaving stumps as a reminder. Behind the line of trees lies another row of apartments. I reside on 42nd Street, but just beyond is 43rd, a less favored strip where the sidewalks crumble and the buildings sag with neglect. The trees there seem to serve as a screen for the disrepair. Crime finds its way into the shadows of this street, but the blame is shared across the way, where other apartments harbor a transient crowd. Still, I find myself at peace where I dwell. It suits my purse, and the conveniences of life are close at hand. The university is but a stroll away, and with two bus stops nearby, the city is mine to navigate with ease.",
            "The neighborhood lay in the embrace of a cul-de-sac, each duplex a mirror to the next, painted in the soft yellows of a weary sun, capped with green metal roofs that shone dully beneath a sky that stretched endlessly blue. These homes, though placed with the carelessness of nature, seemed to breathe as one, their white porches like teeth in a mouth that spoke of simpler days. Here, friendships grew in the spaces between, unbidden yet strong, and the evenings saw us gathered at the unmarked ends of driveways, talking of small things while children played in the dying light, their laughter mingling with the winds that carried echoes of a time not yet forgotten. \n\nIt was a place removed from the harsh mechanics of a world too often lost in its own making, a refuge of fields and trees that stood as sentinels beneath clouds whose whiteness promised no ill. Yet, the season brought with it a whisper of danger, and last night, the sirens called us to heed their warning. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog close, the purse and pillows a poor comfort against the storm’s fury. My larger dog, stubborn in his fear, barked from the living room, the only voice in a world gone quiet save for the hail that hammered the earth with a wrathful hand.\n\nWhen the tempest passed, the road steamed in the sudden cool, the temperature falling like a stone from the heights of summer heat. The hail melted upon the pavement, leaving no trace but the memory of its violence. The skies cleared, and as the sun emerged, a double rainbow arced across the heavens, a fleeting bridge between storms. I captured it with my camera, a moment to share with those far away, their wonder echoing my own.\n\nThe world returned to its routine, the streets silent until the people came home, mothers and children emerging once more beneath a sky washed clean. This place, this haven, had become my own, a respite for a soul from the North transplanted to the South. The voices around me, dipped in the honeyed drawl of the region, spoke of a life I had yet to learn but already loved. My own home, like all others, offered two bedrooms and two baths, yet each space held its own secrets, some tighter than others, their walls whispering stories of those who had come before.\n\nI wandered often to the vast field behind, my feet finding the path to a pond not meant for swimming, a mirror to the sky above. Deer moved like phantoms at dawn, and the deep bass of the bullfrog’s song greeted the morning. It was here I found my peace, just beyond the city’s reach, where roosters called the day into being and a donkey’s bray marked the close of it. This was my village, my sanctuary, a treasure unearthed by chance.",
            "When I first set foot in this new place, a world away from the streets of Riverdale, I was a boy adrift. The weight of what was left behind clung to me, a specter of laughter and love lost in the shifting tides of life. Yet my parents, with all their hopes and dreams bundled into boxes, sought something better for us, a place where the shadows of the past might not follow. So we moved to Stockbridge, a place whispered to be beyond the reach of what was termed \"ghetto.\" The years wore on, and like the slow turning of the earth beneath an indifferent sky, I came to know it. Friends were made and enemies too, for such is the way of things.  \n\nThe neighbors remained a mystery, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis who lived just beyond the fence line. They were good folk, and in time, they felt like kin to me. I recall the day we gathered for Mr. Glen’s wedding, a joyous affair with laughter echoing under the tented sky. When Ms. Veda cast the garter into the crowd, it was my hand that caught it, though the flowers eluded my grasp. We danced into the night, and there was Marsharii, Mr. Glen's daughter, spinning in the twilight. She's gone now, gone to seek her fortune in the wide world.  \n\nThe neighborhood, a labyrinth of streets and alleys, opened itself to me in pieces. With time and technology as my guide, I wandered further than before, often alongside Kason and Curtis. We were an unholy trinity of joy and mischief, bound to our video games and the careless joys of youth. Yet the park called to me, offering solace among the trees, a balm to soothe the restless spirit. I would bring sticks from the store, practicing balance, and wield my wooden sword, a relic of simpler times. The courts lay quiet, though they offer their silent promise of games yet to be played.  \n\nMy father, with his friend Mr. Graves, taught us the art of tennis, a game of patience and precision. The sweat and toil of it were leavened with laughter, a memory of sunlit courts and the thud of ball on racquet. There are many tales bound to this place, moments that linger in the mind like the echo of a distant train. But these are the ones that linger in my heart, and even now, I sense the promise of what is yet to come.",
            "In the quiet heart of South Carolina lies a town unremarkable in its geography, yet profound in its simplicity, named Johnston. It lays claim to the title of Peach Capital of the World, a proud boast etched upon the sign that greets travelers. The land stretches out with peach orchards and cattle farms, the houses scattered far from one another, standing modestly with their metal roofs to ward off the relentless summer sun or clad in gray shingles. They hunker back from the road, leaving the fields to the beasts and the crops.\n\nIn the heart of Johnston, a lone traffic light sways above the crossroads where the town’s sparse commerce resides. Three establishments offer swift sustenance to the passerby: Hong Kong, a Chinese eatery helmed by one family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and the diminutive burger chain known as Gary's. Once there was a pizzeria, but its ovens have long since cooled. There is a pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, revered not for its medicines but for the Cherry Coca-Cola it dispenses. Nearby stands the costly IGA, the town’s sole grocer, where folks seldom do more than gather a few necessities before venturing to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for a proper haul.\n\nThe Dollar General reigns as the busiest emporium, its doors swinging open to a steady stream of patrons all day long. Just down the way, Possibilities Furniture & More offers a warm smile from its proprietor, a woman whose kindness is as much a fixture as the chairs and tables she sells. Her store, a relic of years past, employs two stout men to deliver the furniture they sell. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels caters to the townsfolk's pets, offering services from grooming to boarding.\n\nTucked away from the main street, a doctor and a vet practice their trades, small but ample in their ministrations. Johnston Elementary School teaches the young until they are old enough to journey to the next town for their further education. Parks are absent here, save for the promise of a future recreational space—a mere 2.5 acres, yet a beacon of hope for family gatherings and the lure of new settlers.\n\nIn truth, there is scant entertainment to be found. No cinemas, no lanes for bowling, no haunts for idle youth or playgrounds for the young ones. Yet in its smallness, Johnston holds a charm. A town so quiet, you might drive through it without ever knowing it was there.",
            "In a small town nestled in the southern heart of Tennessee, where the days unfurl slowly and the nights are heavy with silence, lies a suburb much like any other. A connecting street, caught between the arms of two state highways, it bears more traffic than one might care for, yet the world beyond remains hushed and unhurried. The faces here are familiar, etched into the fabric of this quiet neighborhood where time seems to linger. Folks carry on with their yard work, their daily rituals, and in the winter months, the children slide down the hill on our side street, laughter mingling with the cold air.\n\nOur home stands sentinel at the corner, watching the ceaseless ebb and flow of life. We know the cars, every one of them, and when a stranger's wheels roll by, they do not go unnoticed. The neighbors take to the sidewalks, some for exercise, others with dogs in tow. Children ride their bikes, their shouts and calls threading through the air, a tapestry of youth and freedom. We are here, the four of us, my wife and I, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen, moving through our days with a rhythm all our own. We work from home, and our presence is felt, known by those who share this slice of earth with us.\n\nSometimes, we play outside, even as the rain falls like a benediction. On warm evenings, the grill sends its smoky tendrils into the dusk, the scent of barbecue a promise of good things. From March to October, the lawn mowers sing their constant song, the grass a relentless adversary finally defeated by the chill of autumn. This place, once a wooded refuge, still hides beneath a canopy of trees, offering shade in the heat and a deluge of leaves when fall arrives. We rake and burn them, and the scent of burning leaves is a herald of the season's change.\n\nWinters are fleeting now, a mere whisper of their former selves, stretching fall into a long embrace. Our garage, tucked behind the house, sees more of our comings and goings than the front door, which rarely knows the knock of a stranger. There, I toil on my truck or lose myself in other projects, the open doors connecting me to the pulse of the neighborhood. Holidays bring a quiet to these streets; Thanksgiving and Christmas see families gathered, cars lining the curbs, a temporary swell of life.\n\nIn all, I find solace here. Were it not for the roads that cut through, it might be perfect. Yet, even with its imperfections, this place is home.",
            "The land here stretches wide and barren, a vast expanse of high desert where the earth is dust and dirt and the sky is a bleached canvas smeared with the fading hues of day. It is a place where the color brown reigns supreme, and those who live amidst the arid plains know the price of a patch of green, a testament to the stubbornness of life against the relentless sun. I came here first in the nineties, when the houses stood solitary and scattered, each a lone sentinel in the wilderness. Now the city creeps steadily outward, its new limbs reaching into the emptiness, transforming the landscape bit by bit. \n\nThere is a city taking form, though it does not own the soul of one. The people here are mostly friendly, old souls who have found their peace among the sands, and I suppose that makes this neighborhood a gentler place. The stores are the chains that bind all cities, offering their wares under familiar banners, but for those seeking something more, a journey is required. No Whole Foods or upscale retreats are in view here.\n\nConstruction hums as the city's heart beats, an industry that builds upon the bones of the open land, each hammer stroke echoing the march of progress. It stirs something uneasy in me, for I left the hustle of a larger city for the quiet of this place, and I do not wish to return to that clamor. I find my labor in construction, my hands skilled in the art of drywall and T-bar, crafting the walls that rise from the dust.\n\nThe desert holds its own life, a tapestry of creatures woven into the fabric of this harsh world. There is beauty in it, stark and raw, and it asks only for its due respect. My family has come to know these non-human residents, and my children, they are fascinated, spending their days in pursuit of the lizards and insects that scuttle across the sand.\n\nIn this place, there are attractions of a sort. Victorville offers its own experiences, the San Bernardino County Fair a beacon of activity in the quiet, drawing families to partake in its offerings. Nearby, Wrightwood stands with its snow-draped peaks, a contrast to the desert's warmth, inviting those with a thirst for winter's sports. For those who seek the stories of this land, the Victor Valley Museum holds the echoes of the past, its artifacts speaking of the earth's old tales and the hands that shaped the city from the wilderness.\n\nIn the end, this desert is a place of change and constancy, of silence and the whispers of progress. It is a place I call home, a place where life persists in its own wild way.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, the answer that spills forth is perhaps unlike any other. While others might speak of their homes, their streets lined with houses each with its own quiet story, my story diverges. My neighborhood is the college campus where I reside, and those who dwell within the dormitory, they are the fabric of my community. The campus sprawls beyond, a neighborhood in its own right though more distant. Yet in its odd way, my neighborhood holds echoes of the familiar, those traditional places where lives unfold. It has its houses, its souls, its shops and parks, like any other.\n\nLet us speak first of the \"houses\" that shape this place. There are three, distinct and peculiar in kind. The apartments, the houses proper, and the dormitories. In the apartments, small clusters of two to four souls share their space, four to six rooms per floor in buildings that rise for two floors. Some twenty lives inhabit each structure. Then there are the houses, modest abodes of two to four chambers, where alumni find their rest. Few they are, scattered and sparse, a less efficient choice among the sprawl. And finally, the dormitories. Vast halls where hundreds find shelter, two to a room with exceptions, the most common dwelling in this land.\n\nThe people, diverse and varied, stand as testament to the school's pride. Cultures and ages blend, a tapestry of life. Professional staff make their homes in the neighborhood houses, while new students find haven in dormitories, the older ones in apartments. But words alone cannot capture their essence. Better to speak of the stores and the park.\n\nThis self-contained neighborhood, it boasts a wealth of shops and a single park. Dining spots akin to any other place, alongside the school’s own stores of clothing and goods. All needs met within these boundaries. The park, a playground for all, stands clean and safe, watched over by the community's watchful eyes.\n\nSuch is my neighborhood, its heart beating within the campus confines. A place both ordinary and extraordinary, where life unfolds in its own peculiar way.",
            "The sidewalks are a scarcity where I dwell. This land spills downward, and my house perches atop the steepest rise in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill, for the joggers who wrestle with its incline in their daily toil. No sidewalks on the street at all and folks tread the asphalt. The road wears its wounds like a veteran, pitted and worn, a hazard to the unwary driver. Telephone and electric wires hang ragged overhead, tattered by the tempests that rage and rend the branches, leaving the lines a patchwork of constant repair. Tall evergreens stretch skyward wherever you cast your gaze. Yet the people harbor no love for the trees. They wield chainsaws and axes, felling as many as they can, for the trees stand between them and the ocean's vista. Thus, the houses rise, each one climbing higher on the hill, their glass-fronted second stories peering out to the bay. At sunset, the water catches fire from below, the sky ablaze in orange hues. But clouds veil the sun more often than not, and the light filters through a gray haze. Overcast and damp, the days breed moss on all things: roofs, cars, railings. I left my car in the drive for a month, and when I returned, it was green and furred, a testament to neglect. Took three hours to scrape it clean. Children are few here, despite the school a few blocks away. The neighborhood is a haunt of the old, the retired. Dogs replace the children, lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the road. Leave a door ajar and one might slip inside; I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it out. Rabbits roam free, sizable ones that gardeners curse for the holes they dig and the roots they gnaw. Cats love the chase, and mine have hunted most from our midst. The birds keep company: sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle, until the crows chase them away. No stores grace these parts, but a descent to the waterfront finds a few places serving the sea's bounty. The beach is scant, but the rocks invite a throw into the bay. The bay itself is no great span, the far shore visible even through the mist that hangs like a shroud.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, there's a place called Bensonhurst. Find it you will, for the trains that snake their way through the city will take you there, should you choose. A place of streets and bricks and the din of New York's heart. The air is thick with the scent of spices and the chatter of markets, for in the past twenty years, the tide of the East has washed upon these shores. Every block, a shop with its painted signs and its wares, markets bustling with life. Laundromats too, where the machines hum their ceaseless song. These places, they draw the people in, for the goods are fine and the price is light and the walk is short. But do not think it a place of only one kind; the world has come here, and the children of those who came before.\n\nThere is a park not far, with its courts and swings and fields, where the laughter of children rings. In the summer's heat, the water fountain is their joy. And the people who gather there, they are of every stripe, their voices mingling in the air like the colors of a painter’s palette. The buildings rise, but they are homes, not towers. Mostly they are houses, built for families, where lives unfold in the rooms and the yards.\n\nThe noise is part of the air you breathe. The cars roar by, their radios blaring out into the night, the engines growling as they pass. It will wake you, that sound, before the sun has risen. At night, caution is a companion you should keep. This place is as safe as any, but in the shadows, things may stir. I have known the hurt of another's hand here, in those years now gone. And the packages, sometimes they vanish, taken by those who pass unseen. And then there are the dogs, their leavings marking the paths you tread. It's a thing that nettles me, the waste left behind on the way to the station or the store. Watch your step, lest your shoes bear the mark of it.",
            "In Portland, where the rains fall and the clouds hang thick like old tapestries casting shadows over the streets, one must first grapple with the notion of \"weird.\" On the backside of a building that wears many faces—a pizzeria, a bar, a den of music and more—there sprawls a mantra in faded paint: \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it whispers of days gone by, of a time when the city lay beneath a shroud of obscurity and its soul was cheaper to claim. It was a cradle for strange, vibrant subcultures, now overrun by the tide of wealthier souls from southern lands. But still, the city clings to its strangeness. Weirdness here is a kind of acceptance, though perhaps not the kind you find in the gloss of modernity. We buy what we need from faraway lands, like any other place, yet there are a million ways to be not normal. In Portland, you find yoga and hipsters and the suited professionals who stride through their lives with purpose. Perhaps this brand of weirdness is just the art of taking such things lightly.  \n\nIn my neighborhood, colors spill from the houses like dreams escaping, while gardens of herbs and flowers line the streets, whispering of greener times. In the warmth of summer, free boxes appear—cardboard or plastic containers filled with the castoffs of one person, treasures for another. In Southeast Portland, you might find a book or a shirt that seems meant for you, as if the city itself had conspired in the magic of chance. Yet, not all partake in this ritual; some seek their comforts elsewhere, in goat yoga or amidst the roar of a Timbers match.  \n\nPortland is a tapestry of souls chasing dreams—or dreaming of the chase while nursing a drink at a dim bar. The city bears the marks of struggle, for there are those lost to the grip of substances, their woes rooted in unseen scars. The rain and the gray sky seem to weigh heavy on the heart. Homelessness, too, casts its shadow, a riddle unsolved, as the city offers what help it can, though it is never enough. And the people, they sway between compassion and contempt. In this, we are no different from any other place.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. To the north they lie, steadfast witnesses to the sun as it makes its way across the heavens at each dawn and dusk. No matter how I might let them slip from my mind, swallowed by the grind of days and the burdens of life, there they remain, unyielding, untouched by the trials that consume us. On days when the weight of the world threatens to bow my back, they rise to meet my gaze, and in their silence, I find a balm for my restless spirit. They lend me strength, parceling out endurance one day at a time. I came to this place to begin my studies, drawn first by those ridges to the north of the campus. The university itself holds its own charms, with its venerable edifices and tranquil ponds, each claiming a piece of my heart. But it is the mountains that reign supreme, their majesty undeniable. \n\nThe town sprawls in beauty of its own. Countless cafés cradle the weary in the embrace of caffeinated frenzy. A short walk or bus ride leads to the heart of downtown, where the faded bricks of restaurants and offices whisper of times long past. Here, this small town pulses with the life and urgency of the nearby city. Yet it is but a fleeting bustle, for one can slip past the library and find the serene quietude of a small town once more. This mingling of worlds, so near yet so distinct, casts a spell, urging exploration. In such a place, memories flourish, each tied to a corner of the town. Walking past rusted swings after a night without sleep, or dashing through the busy streets to catch a film at the theater, courtesy of the university. \n\nBut as with all places in this life, it holds dark memories too. The ponds, especially, are a stage for reflection and solitary weeping in the grip of an existential storm. I know this well. Watching the turtles and ducks, the insects flitting about their business, I pondered my own purpose, adrift in the enigma of living. I walked on, past ponds and parks and the little houses shouting suburbia, until I reached the main street. There the sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, setting the sky aflame, and I saw that I walked northward. True enough, there they were, as ever. The mountains, those steadfast giants, brushed the hazy blue and yellow sky, rising above the horizon's line of man-made towers. They spoke in their silence, awakening within me a resolve to endure.",
            "In the gathering dusk, where the asphalt bends behind the deserted hulks of commerce, a place stirs, unseen. No place for living, they’d say, these streets trailing the shadows of the old Whole Foods, crouched behind hotels that wake only to family reunions. But there, a world thrives, hidden in plain sight, a world of apartments stacked like old Russian dolls, each nestled against the next in silent succession. The first of these has seen its share of headlines, stories best left to the telling of others, for the truth is often a trickster. Yet beyond, the apartments hold their secrets, their stories unknown to those who hurry past.\n\nAcross the street, where the road is bound by a sleepy college campus, the students drift in like ghosts at dawn, coffee cups held as if to ward off the yawn of early morning. The iron gates creak and sigh, opening slowly, while the commuters curse and fume, trapped in the ritual of the road. Ahead, the street splits like a forked tongue, one side a park where children tumble and play, their laughter carried on the warm wind, ignorant of the world’s weight. The other, a place of healing, where those broken by fate find rest beneath the slow whir of a ceiling fan, the air thick and lazy.\n\nThe old ones walk here, their dogs leading them along the winding paths, eyes narrowed at the skaters who carve through the air like errant limbs. And there, the girls gathered like birds, whispering of dreams and the fleeting fame of the digital age. Nearby, in the quiet of a strip mall, a sushi place waits, its tables seldom filled, between a shop of swimsuits and a nail salon where time drips slow. A man could lose himself here, beneath the neon glow, his hands wet with chlorine and soy sauce, his nails glistening in the false light.\n\nAnd there, a frozen yogurt shop, its sweet burden held by those same skaters, their cups sweating in the heat as they weave stories of rebellion into the air. This neighborhood, this small slice of the South, holds its breath in the slow passage of days, untouched by the world’s ceaseless turning, a fragment of a past that refuses to fade.",
            "The neighborhood lay stretched out under the pale sun, a mosaic of single family homes with a smattering of split and attached dwellings, like some architectural oddity. Each house bore the marks of a bygone era, whispering of the time when the suburban sprawl was the embodiment of the American dream—a dream now receding like the tide. Yet here, in this place, it lingered stubbornly, a testament to those who grasped it fiercely still. The optimism that once coursed through the streets had faded, the yards grown a little wild, but cars still sat like sentinels in the driveways, and children played with the abandon of youth, as if the boundaries of their world encompassed the entirety of existence.\n\nThe school, a relic of nearly ninety years, stood defiant against the passage of time, its halls echoing with the laughter of children and the memories of the old. Churches, scattered and largely empty, gave way to basketball courts, alive with the thump of rubber against asphalt. Each home, unique in form, shared a common spirit, as if the very essence of the neighborhood had seeped into their bones.\n\nA supermarket, known as Super \"A,\" was run by a Yemeni family, likely the sole Arab presence amidst the predominantly African American community. Wide streets invited children to play football, pausing only for the occasional car to pass. Generations had sunk their roots deep into this place, weaving tales of a time when everyone knew everyone, a tapestry of shared history.\n\nThe karate school had vanished, its spirit evaporated with the decline of Hollywood's karate narratives, replaced by a pharmacy—a nod to the modern panacea of pills and potions. Meanwhile, an old movie theater, offering bygone films at modest prices, stood as a refuge for the elders, a small sanctuary from the clamor of youth and the relentless march of time.\n\nAn expressway sliced through the town, though its access lay beyond the borders. A petition for a local exit had once divided young and old—the youth craving connection, the elders fearing intrusion. The latter prevailed, preserving the town's quietude, or so they believed. As a new high school rose from the ground, a debate over its mascot ensued. A cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin—an emblem, perhaps, of this peculiar place, where the past and future flickered like shadows on a wall.",
            "The city sprawls in its vastness, a tapestry of lives interwoven under the gray heavens. The streets are a labyrinth of human endeavor where commerce and residence dance in a discordant waltz. Offices rise like sentinels among the shops and eateries that beckon with their neon allure, each promising a taste of the world beyond. The boutiques, those small miracles of ambition, nestle alongside their larger brethren, the corporate behemoths, and together they line the avenues that pulse with the city’s ceaseless heartbeat. \n\nParks lie scattered like forgotten oases, where the laughter of children pierces the urban din. Here, the city’s soul breathes, its diverse tapestry unfurling in unexpected places. A community rich in its patchwork of lives: the LGBTQ+ enclave, the devout Orthodox Jews, the wandering souls from the lands of the Soviet past. Each a story, each a thread in the city’s vast loom. Beyond the neighborhood’s embrace, the city stretches further, its streets bearing the names of distant lands—Korea, China, Armenia—each a world unto itself, yet bound by the city’s relentless embrace.\n\nBut distance here is a tyrant, its grip tightening with the crawl of traffic. Ten miles a journey without end, the hours claimed by the ceaseless tide of metal and exhaust. Feet seldom tread these streets, the city’s enormity urging its denizens into the chariots of steel. Yet, for all its vastness, the city cannot escape itself; it births new towers of glass and steel, their shadows falling upon the restless streets below. The roads groan under the weight of ambition, and the hearts of its people wonder at the weight of more.\n\nIn this expanse, homes stand as varied as their occupants. Some seek the sky in their towering apartments, others find solace in the embrace of smaller dwellings. From family homes to duplexes, each bears witness to a life lived in its walls. Yet, for all the city’s vastness, the bonds of neighborly kinship have frayed, memories of childhood pastimes now echoes in the urban canyon. The city stands, ever changing, ever the same, a testament to the lives lived within its ceaseless embrace.",
            "She turned to me as we passed the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon and asked, Where is everything? This is it, I said, knowing the vastness of the open land would astonish her. She, from a town where the grocery store lay but a five-minute stroll from her door, had never beheld such expanse. As we drove, I spoke of life in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she came to understand who I was, where I came from. The road was a narrow ribbon, two lanes of cracked asphalt, leading us past a quarry brimming with water, the reflection of the sky trapped in its depths. Beyond lay the small development I called home. Houses of brick and stucco stood in quiet rows, each nestled on half an acre of land, well-tended and proud. In spring, flowers burgeoned in bright profusion, the trees of the Midwest donning their seasonal garb. Mercedes Benz vehicles gleamed in the sun, their chrome polished to mirror brightness after a thorough wash. \n\nAs we neared my gray stucco home, my neighbor, a Korean man with a face as welcoming as the spring breeze, was out mowing his lawn as usual. His voice rose in song over the mower's steady hum, drawing smiles from the neighborhood. He had grown older, his sharpness dulled with time, yet his spirit remained. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and his John Deere, a man of history and heart. \n\nWe arrived at my home. In the side yard, geese wandered, pursued by our terrier in playful chase. Out back, a slender stream fed the quarry, its waters murmuring alongside the bullfrogs and the distant lowing of cattle from the neighboring farms. Across a bridge of weathered wood lay an untouched grove, where trees and wildflowers grew in their own way. Here was the heart of my childhood. Tree forts rose among the branches, and we 'hunted' animals, which meant chasing them through the undergrowth. There was always some adventure, a friend nearby, and the endless stretch of land as our playground.\n\nWinters here could be harsh, unforgiving, yet their beauty was a balm. The green land turned stark, the trees shedding leaves to stand like skeletal sentinels against the sky. When snow fell, it transformed the world overnight. Snow angels marked the yard, made by my little sister, and snowmen stood sentinel. My sister and I, we were warriors then, armed with snowballs, our forts built of snow and branches like armories. In our wonderland, we played at life, carefree and unburdened, just children in a world without end."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies my small town in Michigan, where the old roads meander through farmland and spill into quaint tourist cities. There are no sprawling malls or neon-lit Walmarts, no Targets or even an Applebee’s to speak of. The places you might need lie far off, and travel is a necessity. Yet, despite this, I find myself amidst a beauty unparalleled, encircled by the waters that have cradled this land. My town, if it can be called so, is a peninsula gripped by the arms of Lake Michigan on one flank and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Shores abound where one might wander and feel the cool kiss of the lake upon their feet.\n\nThe neighborhood I call home breathes the essence of small-town life. Houses stand solitary, each with its own story, not replicas of one another, but elder structures, some renewed, others bearing the weight of years. Basements lie beneath, full and visible from the roads that wind by. Aluminum siding clings to many, weathered and strong, and the color of the homes is a patchwork quilt that encircles my own. Yards stretch out before them, where children play upon trampolines and swingsets, where gardens grow and fences keep watch over the creatures within. It is Middle America, a testament to the toils of those who live within its boundaries, raising their kin or having done so.\n\nThe streets are alive with the laughter of children, the steady rhythm of bikes and rollerblades, the soft pad of dogs led by their masters. Neighbors nod in recognition, aware of who belongs and who is a stranger. A wave from a grill, a smile from a passerby with their dog, are the currency of this place. Lawns are tended with care, green and trim, free from the decay of autumn leaves. Plants and bushes stand in neat array, pruned and orderly. It is not a neighborhood that daunts with grandeur but one that whispers of solace and family, of quiet and safety. It is an average place made exceptional by the promise it holds—a sanctuary at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s department keeps vigil, and the health department stands in its shadow. The city recycling center lies just beyond, a hub for the surrounding folk. Baseball and softball fields echo with the voices of announcers and the names of players, and beside them, a small-town airport sends its planes skyward, their engines a low rumble in the air. Ice cream is within reach, a sweet reward at the end of a walk, and downtown beckons from a distance. My children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away, a testament to the spirit of this place. It is a good place to call home.",
            "In the place where I call home, the landscape is a tapestry of sameness, each thread meticulously placed by the unseen hand of the homeowners' association. Upon crossing the threshold into this suburban sprawl, you are met with a parade of houses, each a mirror to the next, their facades pristine and unyielding. The lawns are kept in a neat patchwork of green, sprinkled with stones for ornament, and short driveways lead to garages built for two. Here and there, a tree stands sentinel, a modest testament to nature’s incursion.\n\nThe roads, freshly paved, snake through this enclave of the ordinary, unmarred by potholes or the scars of time, a testament to the diligence of those who see to such matters. The homes stand mostly single-storied, though some dare to reach higher, their windows like eyes watching the quiet streets. Gone are the solitary mailboxes that once marked each plot; in their stead, a cluster waits at the street’s end, keys clinking in locks as neighbors retrieve their mail and packages from the shared boxes—a nod to the unyielding quest for uniformity.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, this neighborhood is a strange blend of the rural and the suburban, sprawling across ample land. Community pools lie behind gates, inviting yet untroubled, while paths wind through the area, offering solace to those who walk their dogs or seek solitude in the fading light. Parks are unnecessary here; the neighborhood itself is vast enough for any runner’s ambition.\n\nRetirees make up the bulk of this community, eyes watching out for one another, bringing a sense of safety that wraps around you like a well-worn coat. But among them, younger faces emerge—professionals who have found a place here, amidst the quiet.\n\nThe city itself looms larger in number than in spirit, a place where the pulse of a small town beats beneath the skin of a bustling populace. There’s a mall, modest in its offerings but sufficient to the needs of those who wander through its halls. Fifteen minutes is the measure of the distance to the heart of commerce, where stores line the streets, each a promise of goods, from the finest organic markets to the stark shelves of discount outlets.\n\nThis neighborhood is a haven of safety and order, with pools to cool the heat of summer and trails that wind like thoughts through the terrain. And though the shops lie further afield, a short drive delivers you to the doors of any chain you desire, convenience a mere engine's purr away.",
            "I first learned of my dwelling through a podcast about the vanished. Surprising in its own right. This place where apartments fetch a thousand a month and yet tales of the lost lingered unknown. Neither I nor my friends knew of such stories. Perhaps it's the struggle. Some nights, friends weep themselves into restless sleep. The cost of living steep, yet frugality's been our teacher over the years. The scent of flea market relics and mothballed garments becomes familiar, almost comforting. The smells of adulthood, subdued in their presence, cling to you like a second skin. Smoking or simply accustomed, you find the flea market's essence undeniable. Dusty magazines on a silent piano. The scent burrows into leather, stubborn against washing. Here, three thrift stores lie within steps. Start at the far end, wander through charity thrifts, past a library, a rare book shop, and a store of curiosities. Downtown, dense with life, cars and people throng the streets, yet within the thrift's walls, silence prevails. The perfect refuge for an afternoon adrift. Each year, more souls flood the city. A city swelling under the weight of its own burgeoning empire. A place reminiscent of New York, where people pursue their own paths, seldom asking of you. Alone, a quiet independence respected. Not like the South, where curiosity signals care. Here, lives remain unprobed, shells intact as the city ebbs and flows like tides. A place alive, between the pianist next door and the singers above. Strangers in apartments become a community. Needs met, birthdays marked, funerals mourned, aid given. Fortunate to be here, neighbors kind and well-meaning. I return the favor, tidying after myself, sharing food. Mail exchanged. A pleasure to see them, and perhaps they think the same of me. In this vast, impersonal sprawl, it's the neighbors who make it feel less like ruin.",
            "In a small town nestled in the Midwest, there lies the edge of the world, just beyond the reach of the city where the sprawling suburbs give way to a more modest existence. The neighborhood where I dwell stands on the eastern fringe, marked by economic struggle and homes that wear the years in their sagging frames. Low the worth of these lands, where tenants and owners alike count their pennies, yet there is a beauty that resists the sum of its parts. The people who pass by offer a nod, a greeting, their faces lined with stories untold. \n\nCrime has its own dance here, a little more frequent than in other quarters, yet it does not overshadow the day. Tales of violence linger in the air, whispers of past years where blood was spilled not far from where I lay my head. Our next-door neighbors, they lost a son to the night outside a bar where shadows stretch long. But fortune has spared us the worst, our losses confined to what the porch could not guard.\n\nThe town itself bears the scars of a different war, the kind fought with needles and pills. The scourge of opioids, fentanyl a ghostly reaper, has claimed many souls. Yet even in this, there is a battle waged, with centers for healing and hands that train others to bring back the lost from the brink.\n\nAmidst these trials, light finds its way. My son attends a school where the halls hum with a kindness that shields him from life's cruelties. The teachers there, the staff, they are a beacon, and the boy thrives in their care. The community gathers, a PTO that breathes life into the year with events that bind us all together. In a town where poverty stalks one in five, the school offers its children meals freely, a stand against hunger. No child there feels the weight of what they cannot pay.\n\nThe city fathers have turned their gaze to the heart of the town, paving roads, tending to the green, yet the east where I dwell remains a shadow in their plans. The center thrives, the west bustles with commerce, but here on the eastern edge, we wait for the light to reach us.\n\nStill, this town is home. Its people, its schools, the shops that line its streets, they meet our needs. The house we call ours may not boast of wealth, but it holds comfort, and that is its own treasure. Sixteen years we have stood upon this soil, and in our hearts, there lies no desire to be elsewhere.",
            "In the heart of the city stands a neighborhood steeped in tales of its own, perched upon a hill and hemmed in by the memories of structures long past. I dwell in a seven-story apartment, a lone sentinel across from the old theater where once voices soared and stories unfurled. Down the slope, a block away, lies a curious haunt, an arcade bar, where souls converge in the sultry throes of summer nights. June and July see them in clusters, a line snaking along the pavement, each waiting for a moment inside. Not far, the city park sprawls wide, a rare expanse of green amid the urban sprawl. Concrete girds it and stairs run steep, carved into the earth like secrets kept. When winter's breath bites, the homeless come, pitching tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk, the wide steps their refuge. Snow is scarce, but the rain comes relentless, a deluge that chills bones and spirits alike. They huddle close, seeking warmth in the city's core, not far from the family center where solace might be found, a chance to wash away the grime of wandering. But it is not these things that bind me to this place. It is not the grandeur of the past, nor the elegance of architecture that graces the hillsides sloping to the sea. What I cherish is the spirit of the people, the tapestry of lives woven through Hilltop. Once, it was a name spoken in fear, a haven for violence that painted the West Coast red. Stories linger still, whispers of the DEA and federal might sweeping through like a cleansing wind. The people remember, passing tales from one generation to the next, even to newcomers like myself. They toil in earnest, striving to shed the past, to nurture their streets with care and pride. Some say it's unwise to walk Hilltop by night if you're white, a caution rooted in bygone days and the bitter tang of prejudice. Yet, perhaps I tread unnoticed, just dark enough to blend, or maybe Hilltop sees in me a kindred soul, one who knows the weight of history that bears down upon us all. In a city that should be a mosaic of cultures, the old wounds still fester. But the Hilltop is my heart. Walking those streets under the cloak of night, I find life there, a kinship with people more likely to offer a coat than ill intent. It's a place where laundromat lights linger longer for a phone to find power, where I've sat shrouded in the night’s chill, only to be seen, handed a token of humanity, and told I am beautiful and worth something.",
            "I came to this place on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world was as uncertain as the shadows cast by the old elms at dusk. It was not easy to find kin in those early days. Yet I found myself drawn close to a lad who dwelt two doors down and another who lived along the same winding street. Those boys are gone now, their laughter and companionship scattered to the winds, but the echoes of our time remain etched into the fabric of this place. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still here, their lives woven into the quiet tapestry of this American suburb.\n\nThe houses here stand two stories tall, their facades reflecting the sameness of the world in which they stand. On warm days, the voices of children thread through the air, a symphony of innocence and joy. But for the most part, silence reigns here, and I have never found cause for discord among these neighbors. Solitude is a gift in this place, until the hour comes when you seek the hands of others. Packages arrive at my door, untouched by the specter of theft, and I find a strange solace in this trust.\n\nA park lies a stone’s throw from my door, a realm of memories both cherished and unwelcome. There I have played games of sport, felt the sting of a wayward elbow upon my nose, yet the warmth of camaraderie overshadows such fleeting pain. Nowadays, when my feet tread that familiar ground, it is with my cousin’s young ones, their delight in the swings and slides a balm for nostalgia's ache.\n\nThis neighborhood is a patchwork of souls and stories, diverse as the flavors that linger in the air. Within a mile's stride, one finds the spices of China, India, Mexico, and Italy. Yet the folk here often summon their meals through the ether, with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash delivering sustenance to their doors. The fast-food joints hold sway, as they do in many suburbs, their lights a beacon of sameness. Yet there is variety to be found, even an Indian-owned store that beckons with promises of distant lands.\n\nThe shops here are a bounty of necessity and indulgence, from dry cleaners to pharmacies, and the Jewel-Osco, a staple of the Midwest. This place, with its quiet streets and whispers of wind, has become a refuge. Tales from the world beyond, tales of strife and neighborly woe, serve only to deepen my gratitude for the peace I find here.",
            "The world as I find it lies close by the college where I spend my days, and I take some solace in that fact. The landscape is dotted with apartment blocks and the occasional refuge of dining and drink, places that offer a modicum of diversion without too severe a toll on the pocket. A certain tavern recently took on a new name and with it a heftier price, though the spirits and service could be worse. Folks here are largely amiable. They are students or else of modest means, drawn by the low rents. Children abound, their laughter mingling with the breeze from the nearby school. I keep to my own and have no need for the company of neighbors. They indulge in the smoke that clouds the halls, prompting management to install an air freshener outside their door, an action that my companion and I find near comical in its futility. \n\nThe buildings carry the weight of years in their visage though some hide modern interiors. Down the way, new homes rise, hollow in construction yet dressed in high rents, a charade tolerated due to their nearness to the campus. A mere five minutes’ walk finds a cheap eatery where food, served on paper, emerges from the hum of microwaves. Across the street stands a gas station, its reputation as an employer poor. Yet, the city’s hand has touched the road, granting it a fresh face with wide sidewalks and green spaces, an attempt at grace amidst decay. My own dwelling is cushioned by trees, though some have fallen to the axe, leaving behind stumps, reminders of what once was. Behind the apartment lies another street, less cared for, its walkways crumbling, its buildings weary. Trees line the avenue, perhaps to veil the neglect beneath. \n\nCrime is whispered of, particularly from a complex down yonder, though it is not alone in such tales. Across from my own abode, shadows flit through a transient populace, but I find contentment here. It suits my purse, and the conveniences are many—the university a short walk, the buses ready to carry me to the market or into the heart of the town.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawled beneath the wide and endless sky, where duplexes stood in quiet formation along the cul-de-sac, each painted in the same sun-drenched yellow with white porches and roofs of green metal. They seemed to stand as solitary houses, scattered like memories of another time. In the evenings, we gather, a cluster of souls at the end of a driveway not marked by plan or intent, while children spin their worlds in colored chalk and kites that strain against the tethering earth. It is a breath of yesterday in a world too quickened by machines and screens. The fields stretch wide around us, wrapped in the arms of trees, the sky above a canvas of blue and cloud, and yet there is a shadow that leans upon the land.  \n\nIn this season, the air is thick with the threat of storms, and last night the sirens rose, their wail cutting through the stillness, driving us to shelter. I found myself ensconced in the narrow womb of the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, a purse, a few pillows. The large dog refused the sanctuary of the bathroom, pacing and barking in the living room, unsettled by the strangeness of the hour. Outside, the world was silent save for the hammer of hail upon the earth, the neighborhood hushed in anticipation.  \n\nWhen the storm had passed, the road was a river of steam, the heat of the day fleeing before the sudden coolness. The temperature had fallen like a stone, the hail melting as it met the hot ground. I looked up, and the sky was clearing, the sun breaking through to paint a double rainbow across the heavens. I ran inside, fetched my camera, capturing the moment to share with kin and friends far distant, their awe echoing my own.  \n\nThe streets remained still for a time, until the people returned from where they had sought refuge, the rhythm of life resuming its gentle cadence. Mothers and children emerged, the scent of cooking meals drifting on the air. It is a place of warmth and welcome to this stranger from the north, where the voices are wrapped in the soft music of the southern drawl.  \n\nMy dwelling is like all the others, two bedrooms, two baths, though within each lies its own secret, some small, some spacious, a mystery of design. I find solace in the great field behind, where a path winds to a pond not meant for swimming, a place where deer wander and the bullfrog sings his morning song. It is a sanctuary, just beyond the city's reach, where each dawn is heralded by the crow of roosters, the farms that border our small enclave. And in the evening, the bray of a donkey calls out from a nearby farm, a voice in the gathering dusk. This place, this hidden gem of a neighborhood, has offered me its quiet grace.",
            "In the ten years I've wandered this patch of earth, there's been a reckonin' of sorts within me. When first my feet set upon this ground, I was adrift in sorrow. Riverdale lay behind, its memory a shadow clinging close. My tears fell, for I left behind kin and land I loved. But my mama and papa sought a better place, a place where my sister and I could grow like saplings unbent by the wind, in a house they deemed fit for us, in a school unmarred by the ghetto's whisper. \n\nTime, that old relentless river, carried me forward. In its flow, I found companions and foes, both. Of the neighbors, I came to know but a few. Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis, they were all in the circle of my knowing. They've been a solace, almost kin, and for that, I hold them dear. I recall, clear as day, the time when we all went to see Mr. Glen wed anew. It was a day of lightness, a day to dream of for my own future, of a life wrought in gold for some bride to be. When Miss Veda cast her garter into the air, it was I who caught it, though the flowers escaped my grasp. We danced beneath the stars, and I took joy with Marsharii, his daughter, a fleeting presence whose path I hope has led to grander things.\n\nThe streets here wind like a labyrinth, though now with the guide of a GPS, I find time to wander. My feet have carried me as far as they dared with Kason and Curtis at my side. We, who spent our days lost in games and laughter, living each moment as if it were our last. The park calls to me often, a balm for my spirit, offering solace beneath its boughs. There, among the trees, I find my balance with sticks from the depot, wielding my bokken like a samurai of old.\n\nCourts for tennis and basketball stand silent, though they remember the sweat and toil of our games. My father, alongside Mr. Graves, taught us the ways of tennis, and in their training, we found joy. Yes, this place has held many moments of delight, tales etched in the fabric of my being. Yet still, I sense the horizon holds more, a promise of the best yet to unfurl.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies Johnston, a town that whispers its own tales. It's not a place that strikes one as distinct, yet it holds its ground in the world of agriculture. They call it the Peach Capital of the World, a claim that stands bold against the sky on the town’s sign. Fields stretch wide, a patchwork of peach trees and cattle pastures, the land breathing in the sun's relentless gaze. Houses, those not within the town's narrow heart, scatter themselves across the countryside. Some rise two stories high, capped with metal against the summer blaze or clad in gray shingles. They sit back from the road, granting the front fields to animals or crops as though in quiet homage to the land.\n\nIn the town's core, a lone stoplight sways above the crossroads, marking the hub of commerce. A triad of eateries offers solace to the hungry traveler: Hong Kong, a small Chinese enclave run by one family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary’s, a humble burger joint. The pizzeria shuttered its doors not long ago, leaving its absence to echo in the town’s memory. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family pharmacy, finds renown not for its pills but for the Cherry Coca-Cola that bubbles within its walls. Then there’s the IGA, a grocery store both small and dear, where shoppers pick up just a thing or two before heading to the Walmart yonder in Batesburg-Leesville.\n\nDollar General stands as the town's beacon, its shelves laden with the essentials of everyday life, bustling from dawn till dusk. Nearby, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a woman known to all, has stood for a generation. Two men work there, delivering sofas and tables to those who call the town home. Attached is Clark’s Cuts and Kennels, where pets are groomed and tended, their services a comfort to the residents.\n\nA doctor and a veterinarian offer their care on the outskirts, small practices but sufficient. Johnston Elementary holds the town's children until fifth grade, after which they venture to the next town for further schooling. There’s talk of a park, 2.5 acres of promise, where families might gather and outsiders be drawn. For now, the town offers no theaters, no alleys for bowling, no places for idle gathering. But in its quiet, Johnston holds a charm, fleeting as it may be, that lingers even as one passes through, perhaps without noticing at all.",
            "In the small southern town of Tennessee where I live, there's a street that runs between two state highways, drawing more traffic than one might hope for. The neighborhood otherwise drifts in a quiet repose. Folks are settled here, not much coming and going. Faces familiar in the way of old photographs. The people tend to their yards, the rhythm of daily chores marking time. In winter, the children sled down the hill on the side street, laughter echoing in the brittle air. Our house stands at the corner, a sentinel to the comings and goings, and we've grown acquainted with the cars that pass. A strange vehicle catches the eye, a note taken. Neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs, children pedal their bikes, the usual dance of suburb life. We stay home often, working from the house, my wife and I, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. Our presence as much a fixture as the old oak at the edge of the yard. We play outside, even when the rain falls. Sometimes we grill on the back deck, the scent of barbecue a comfort and a call. The sound of lawn mowers is a constant from March to October, when the grass finally yields. The neighborhood is shaded by trees, remnants of the wood that once stood here, and in Fall, leaves carpet the ground, demanding rake and flame. The smell of burning leaves is a harbinger of the season's turn. Winter has grown mild, a long Fall stretching its fingers over the months. Our garage sits at the back, rendering the front door nearly forgotten. When I work on my truck or other projects with the garage doors thrown open, I feel a part of the neighborhood's pulse. Holidays bring a hush over the street, Thanksgiving drawing families together, cars lining the curbs with out-of-town plates. It's the same for Mother's Day, for Christmas. This place is home, settled in the bones. If only it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "In the barren expanse of the high desert where the land stretches out with a relentless constancy of dirt and more dirt and where the horizon is a line of ochre and dust, my neighborhood stands. The brown earth is ever-present, a constant reminder of the sun’s relentless gaze, and where a green lawn emerges it speaks to the wealth of water spent in its keeping. Back in the nineties, the houses lay scattered across the landscape, distant as stars in a vast sky. Now they grow closer, like the slow encroachment of civilization upon a forgotten land, and the city creeps into being with each passing day, a reflection of change echoed in many places.\n\nThe folk here are kind enough, old faces with gentle smiles, and the neighborhood is good, or so it seems, as places go. Chain stores pepper the streets, Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, but for anything finer, the kind that speaks to luxury, you must travel far. Whole Foods and such are strangers to this dust-choked realm. The work that calls most is construction, the skeletal rise of buildings in the open spaces that still linger, and it unnerves me to think of what may come. I left the city once and have no wish to return to its clamor. My own trade is in the craft of walls and ceilings, a labor of hands shaping spaces.\n\nYet there is a beauty here in the starkness, a draw that pulls people to the high desert, a wilderness forged by harsh climate and rugged topography, a home to creatures that wander this arid land. We, who dwell here, must learn to share this place with them, these non-human neighbors, and find a way to live side by side. My family and I, we have made peace with the wild. My children, three in number, chase lizards and insects beneath the sun’s glare, their laughter echoing in the dusty air.\n\nFor those who seek diversion, Victorville offers its own charm, a place where families may find the desert’s heart. The annual San Bernardino County Fair brings its own brand of joy, a blend of tradition and revelry. Venture to Wrightwood to witness snow upon the peaks, to feel the cold bite and perhaps learn the art of winter’s sport. The Victor Valley Museum stands as a testament to the land’s history, with relics of stone and bone, the artifacts of those who walked before us, and the stories of industry and life in this place called Victorville.",
            "When I think on where I live, the truth of it is a place set apart from those who dwell in houses with yards and picket fences. A place that is not a place in the sense of possession but in the sense of habitation. The college campus is the land I call home, and the dormitory my house, and the souls who occupy it my kin. The sprawl of the campus reaches out like a township, its bounds and borders dissolving into the world beyond. Yet for all its peculiarity, it is a neighborhood not unlike any other. There are structures and there are people, there are places to gather and to dwell, places to buy and places to play.\n\nLet us speak of the structures first. There are the apartments, small and clustered, where two to four souls share a room, and the floors stack upon each other like strata of rock in the earth, two deep, housing twenty lives or more. There are the houses, rare and scattered, for those tied to the institution in ways more permanent, alumni who dwell in the past and present all at once. And there are the dormitories, vast and teeming, where hundreds find shelter, two by two, under a single roof. This is the lay of the land.\n\nNow to the people. The school boasts of its diversity, and in truth it is a tapestry of cultures and ages, woven together in this place. The staff inhabit the scattered houses, the young ones fill the dormitories, and the elder students find a home in the apartments. But words alone cannot capture the essence of these people, and so we move on to speak of the stores and parks.\n\nWithin this self-contained world are the places of commerce, the dining halls and shops that bear the school's own mark. All that one seeks can be found within these confines. And there is a park, a common ground where all meet, kept clean and safe by the hands of those who call this place home. A playground for the diverse populace, a testament to the care of the community.\n\nThis then is my neighborhood, a place both peculiar and familiar, a microcosm of life in all its forms.",
            "There are no sidewalks where I live. The land slopes down as if the earth itself is weary, and my house perches atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood. They call it the \"work out hill,\" this incline where joggers labor in their ascent, their footsteps echoing on the hard, unyielding road. The street is a patchwork of pitted asphalt, a test for tires and nerves alike. Overhead, the wires dangle, a tangled web of electric and telephone lines, tattered by storm and time. The rain comes often, a relentless visitor that lashes the trees and tears at the power lines, leaving them mended in a checkered mosaic of repairs.\n\nTall evergreens stand sentinel, their presence a source of contention among the people who live here. They cut them down when they can, these trees that dare obscure the vista of the ocean. The houses climb the hill, glass-fronted and defiant, each seeking the horizon where the bay meets the sky. At sunset the water ignites with an inner flame, the sky a canvas of orange, but more often than not, clouds loom heavy, and the sun's light is but a ghostly glow through the mist. The days are gray, the air heavy with moisture. Moss claims its dominion over roofs, cars, railings, anything it can grasp. I left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned it was a green beast, furred with moss, and it took three hours of scraping to see it shine again.\n\nChildren are scarce in these parts, though a school stands not far off. The neighborhood is a haven for the old, the retired, lives lived in quiet rhythm. Dogs replace the laughter of children, and they roam the yards and chase one another down the street. Leave a door ajar, and you might find one in your living room, a trespasser to be gently shooed away. Rabbits abound, burrowing and rooting, much to the gardeners' despair, yet my cats delight in them, their presence an invitation to hunt. The birds come too, sparrows and hummingbirds flitting among the branches, while hawks and eagles circle until the crows rally to drive them away.\n\nThere are no stores here, but down the hill where the land meets the sea lie a few restaurants, their offerings of fresh seafood a draw to the weary traveler. The shore is rocky, no beach to speak of, only stones to cast into the bay. The water is not wide; you can see the land across, a faint outline even through the ever-present mist.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, if your compass is set for Bensonhurst, you'd find no travail in reaching it. The veins of the city, the subways and buses, carry the echo of a metropolis that never sleeps. Bensonhurst stands a testament to the very heart of New York City. As you tread these streets, be prepared for the sight of Asian emporiums that seem to have sprung as if by some invisible hand. Two decades past, a tide of Asian souls found harbor here, and now their presence marks every block with stores like sentinels in a foreign land. Supermarkets and laundromats, their windows ablaze with neon, call out with the promise of sustenance and cleanliness. The food is good and costs less, a siren’s song for the thrifty. Close by, where I reside, four such markets lie within but a two-minute stroll, a testament to the ease of life’s provisions here.\n\nYet do not think Bensonhurst solely a canvas painted in Asian hues. No, it is a mosaic of the world, a gathering of immigrants and their progeny, a tapestry of first and second-generation Americans. Still, the Asian influence is strong, their hands guiding the most prominent of ventures. Nearby, a park lies renewed, a paradise of play with its courts and fields, swings and fountains where children find joy in the summer’s heat. Diversity reigns here, a harmony of tongues and hues, united in the dance of sport and leisure.\n\nBuildings do not climb to the sky here. They are humble, two-family homes holding their ground against the encroaching shadows of co-ops and condominiums. The people, they are kind but loud, their voices rising with the blare of car radios, engines roaring like beasts unchained, rousing the slumbering dawn.\n\nAs night falls, tread with caution. Bensonhurst is safe, mostly, but the heart of man is a mystery. Trouble lurks in the guise of youth and thieves, shadows that once found me and left their mark. Packages vanish as if by magic, spirited away by unseen hands. And then there is the matter of dogs, their leavings a blight on the streets. It is the law here to clean after them, but the law is a whisper in the wind, often unheard. Daily, the waste litters the path to the train, to the market, a constant companion to the wary traveler. Tread carefully, lest your soles carry the stain of this place.",
            "The first thing you must grasp about Portland, Oregon is the notion of \"weird.\" A phrase scrawled across the backside of a building that stands as a pizza parlor, a bar, a music stage, a den of undress, and skirts the fringes of law like a thin veil, shouts \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it whispers of a bygone era, the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, less known and less dear, where subcultures bloomed like wildflowers in the cracks of pavement. To others, it's a siren's call, beckoning to those who wear their oddities as a badge of honor. Despite the flood of well-heeled Californians and the ceaseless rise of condominiums to shelter them, Portland remains in its peculiar embrace. Yet, weird does not always dance with acceptance, though it opens its arms to the unaccepted. It does not mean we shun the trappings of the modern age or the battles it brings. Like the rest of the land, our goods bear the mark of distant shores. A million shades of weirdness, each hue not quite normal, yet Portland wears its normalcy too: yoga and hipsters and suits of business. Perhaps weird means we hold all this with a lighter heart. In my corner of this city, as in many others, houses boast colors bright, gardens spill with blooms and herbs and vegetables, and the sidewalks are lined with free boxes when summer reigns. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold treasures discarded yet perfect, waiting for the right soul to pass by. A book, a garment, or anything at all might lie within. This magical chance of a stroll through a Southeast neighborhood captures the essence of Portland as I see it, though I am but one among the myriad shades of weird. Some neighbors would not dream of plucking their attire from a sidewalk box. They seek out goat yoga—yes, yoga amidst live goats—or rally their voices at Timbers matches, cheering the city's soccer heroes. Portland brims with souls bound to their passions, some chasing dreams, others dreaming amid the bar’s embrace. Ours is a city with a drug scourge, often rooted deep in the mind’s struggles, the relentless rain and brooding clouds a possible accomplice. Homelessness casts a long shadow, a riddle unsolved. Drawn here by social services more generous than most lands, yet still they fall short. The rest of us sway between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not so strange at all.",
            "The mountains stood eternal, witness to the sun's ancient journey, keeping their vigil in the north. They did not waver, unmoved by the clamor of life, while I, lost in the pursuits of my days, often forgot them. Yet they were always there, demanding to be seen when the weight of the world bore down upon me. I would turn to them, find solace in their stoic presence, and gather strength to carry on, a day at a time. \n\nWhen I first came to this place for my studies, it was those mountains north of the campus that seized my heart. The university had its own charms—grand buildings, tranquil ponds, and whispering trees—but the mountains reigned supreme, an unyielding king. The town itself held beauty, a tapestry of small cafés where time slipped by in caffeine-fueled marathons of study. A few steps more, and the downtown embraced you with its echo of ages, the faded bricks lining the streets, a testament to time's passage. Here, this quiet town found its pulse, a brief surge of city life in the midst of its suburban calm. But the chaos did not stretch far, and beyond the library lay the quiet refuge of small-town peace.\n\nThis city, with its shifting moods, beckoned exploration, each corner a memory waiting to be made. Strolls past the rusty swings in the park after nights without sleep, or dashing through the bustling streets to catch a show at the theater, tickets courtesy of the university. But as with all places, it bore its share of sorrow. The ponds, mirrors of the soul, offered refuge in moments of introspection and tears, the moon high and the hour late, as life's questions loomed large. Watching the birds and insects go about their business, I pondered my place, adrift in the enigma of existence.\n\nAnd so, I wandered past the ponds, past the park, through the neighborhoods with their quiet houses, until I reached the main road. There the sun cast its radiant light upon the palms, painting the sky in hues of dawn. I realized my steps had led me northward. And there they were, as ever, the mountains, brushing the hazy sky with their grandeur. In their silent counsel, I found my resolve, steadfast as the mountains themselves.",
            "You might pass it by, not seeing it at first. It's just a residential area behind a row of shops, a place not much thought of for living. Not for most anyway. But if you wander past the deserted Whole Foods, past the hotels that fill only once a year save for the summer's brief gatherings of kin, you'll find a lively enclave hidden there. On these streets, lined up like those Russian dolls, each apartment block is set down one beside the other, a careful and deliberate array. The first buildings you come to have held stories in the news, tales not fit for repeating, so we'll leave them in their shadows. But beyond them lies another realm, one few know of. Across the street, a quiet campus for a community college stands, a sleepy bastion where students arrive, coffee in hand, stifling yawns in the early hours to start their long days. The iron gates groan wide to let them through, while the commuters grumble in their cars, fists shaking at the delay when the crowd grows thick. The road bends into another, lined with homes, where a park lies on one side and a center for healing broken bones on the other. The rehab place has its porch set with cheerful seats and a fan that churns slowly in the summer's heavy air. Children dash through the park's grass, spinning and laughing among the flowers where bees drone lazily. Elderly folk walk dogs, frowning at the skaters, nodding with a kind of knowing to the girls who whisper secrets by the swings. A strip mall by the park holds a sushi place, never quite busy, and you’ll find a shop for pool supplies and a nail salon beside it, snug and unassuming. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, and eat hibachi all at once—such is the charm of these small-town malls. A frozen yogurt shop is there as well, the kind where you serve yourself, and you’ll see the teens at the park with their cold, dripping cups, doing tricks on skateboards, puffing clouds of vapor, the picture of what they think is cool. This neighborhood, it's a slice of old America, a piece of the quiet South where time seems to stand still and little ever changes.",
            "The neighborhood stands as a relic of another era, where the American dream was once a tangible thing. Houses line the streets, mostly single-family dwellings, but there are those split in two, attached as if in some forgotten symbiosis. My own home sits with a small yard before it, a humble driveway to its side, an echo of a time when the suburbs embraced this nation, now distant and drawing away. Yet this place remains, whispering the dream still breathes, and we clutch at it with the last of our strength.\n\nThe optimism that once painted the faces of the people fades like old photographs. The little yards no longer kept with the same pride, but still, cars rest in the driveways, and the children play as if the world beyond their laughter were nothing but a distant dream. The old school, standing nearly ninety years, seems to hold the future in its walls, a vessel of nostalgia for the elders who pass by. Churches stand few and far between, their pews empty, but the courts where basketballs echo are never silent.\n\nEach house wears a different face yet shares the same soul. A large market, Super \"A,\" held by a Yemeni family, perhaps the sole Arab roots in this soil. The majority here are African American, their stories woven into the fabric of this place. Streets wide and welcoming, where kids play their games, momentarily pausing for the passing cars. Generations have settled here, telling tales of a time when every neighbor was a friend.\n\nOnce there was a karate school. When Hollywood ceased to spin tales of karate kids, the children turned away, and now it stands as a pharmacy, the promise that pills can mend what ails you. A small movie theater clings to life, showing old films at a price the young deem unworthy, but the elders find solace in its dim light, escaping the clamor of youthful ambition.\n\nThe expressway cuts through the town, though its access lies elsewhere. There was a time when a petition called for an exit here, the young cried for it, but the elders held firm in their refusal, fearing it would rend the fabric of their home. A new high school rises, and with it, the debate over a mascot. A cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin, a fitting emblem for this place that straddles the past and the future with a foot in each.",
            "In the sprawling city where I dwell, the neighborhood is a patchwork of lives and places, a mosaic of humanity's ventures. Houses and homes scattered among the commerce of life, as if cast by the hand of some indifferent god. Offices stand beside stores and eateries, theaters of delights and distractions. There is always a new table to lay one's troubles upon or a shop to wander through, seeking what one does not know one seeks. The grand emporiums, names known and whispered across lands, stand shoulder to shoulder with small sanctuaries of goods, boutiques that speak in softer tones and beckon the passerby. They line the thoroughfares, these establishments, and their presence brings a hum to the quarters that would otherwise nest in silence.\n\nThe parks are not far, green havens where mothers and fathers bring their young to bask in the innocence of play. And the people, oh, the people, they are of every kind. Here is a place where the colors of the world mix and mingle, a tapestry woven with threads of many origins. The pride of the LGBTQ+ lives alongside the solemnity of the Orthodox Jew, and the echoes of the Soviet Union find refuge here. Beyond, the city stretches, each enclave a world unto itself, Korea, China, Armenia, and more, each a testament to the journeys of the soul.\n\nBut the roads are long, and the hours pass slowly in the confines of the steel chariots that crawl upon them. A journey of mere miles becomes an odyssey, and the feet of men grow idle. The city sprawls wide, and the habit of walking has withered under the weight of time and distance. Our streets, they are burdened with the ceaseless flow of traffic, a river of iron that knows no peace, and the finding of a place to rest one's vehicle is a quest unto itself.\n\nYet still they come, the builders with their dreams of towering abodes, casting shadows upon the land. A place of allure, yet the hearts of those who dwell here grow weary at the thought of more souls, more wheels upon the roads. The homes are as varied as the people, from grand dwellings to humble abodes, each a story in itself, each a shelter from the world’s chaos. Here families find their refuge, and here, in the quiet corners, the children once played, their laughter a balm against the solitude of the city.\n\nI know not the faces of most who share this place with me. The bonds that once tied us close have slackened, though in the memory of youth, I recall the days when we were kin, neighbors whose doors were always open. Those were the days of sunlight and simplicity, when the world was small and kind.",
            "Where is everything? she asked from the seat beside me, her eyes wide as we drove through the endless stretch of cornfields that framed the world. This is it, I replied, a wry smile on my lips, knowing full well her disbelief in the vacancy of the land. She hailed from a town where a grocery store lay just a stone's throw from her doorstep, where wide-open spaces were a rarity, a myth. But here, amidst the vastness, I unfolded the story of my upbringing in rural Ohio, and in that telling, she began to see the roots that held me. Down that narrow country road, past the fields and the sunlit quarry brimming with water, lay the small enclave where I was born and raised. The houses stood firm in brick and stucco, each claiming half an acre or more, every bit of land a testament to the pride of its keeper. Come spring, flowers burst forth in riotous color, and the trees, ever loyal to the seasons, donned their changing garb. In the driveways, Mercedes Benz cars gleamed, freshly baptized by the hose, their surfaces a mirror to the midday sun. As we neared my gray stucco house, my Korean neighbor waved, his face a map of kindness. He spent his days under the sky, the grass his canvas, and his mower his brush, a song rising above its mechanical drone. We all found joy in his tune, a melody of sincerity, and the stories of his past. Once a doctor, now a part of the landscape, he rode his John Deere as if it were an extension of himself. And finally, my home. In the side yard, the geese gathered, scattering before the exuberant chase of our Terrier. Beyond the house, a stream meandered, singing its quiet song as it flowed toward the quarry. Bullfrogs joined the chorus, their calls mingling with the distant lowing of cattle. Across a bridge crafted by hand, an untouched sanctuary waited, where trees grew wild and herbs and flowers bloomed without hindrance. Here was my realm of childhood, a place of forts built high in branches, of imagined hunts where the chase was the thrill. Always some child nearby, ready to join in the adventure. Winters brought a cold that bit deep, yet with it came a beauty unmatched. The land transformed, the vibrant hues of summer giving way to stark silhouettes of trees, their limbs bare against the sky. Snow, when it came, cloaked everything in silence, a wonderland in white. My sister and I, adversaries in play, took to snowballs as our chosen arms, constructing forts of snow and branch to hold our arsenal. In that frozen world, we found our freedom, children unburdened by the weight of years, lost in the simple joy of being."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies my small town in Michigan, where the old roads meander through farmland and spill into quaint tourist cities. There are no sprawling malls or neon-lit Walmarts, no Targets or even an Applebee’s to speak of. The places you might need lie far off, and travel is a necessity. Yet, despite this, I find myself amidst a beauty unparalleled, encircled by the waters that have cradled this land. My town, if it can be called so, is a peninsula gripped by the arms of Lake Michigan on one flank and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Shores abound where one might wander and feel the cool kiss of the lake upon their feet.\n\nThe neighborhood I call home breathes the essence of small-town life. Houses stand solitary, each with its own story, not replicas of one another, but elder structures, some renewed, others bearing the weight of years. Basements lie beneath, full and visible from the roads that wind by. Aluminum siding clings to many, weathered and strong, and the color of the homes is a patchwork quilt that encircles my own. Yards stretch out before them, where children play upon trampolines and swingsets, where gardens grow and fences keep watch over the creatures within. It is Middle America, a testament to the toils of those who live within its boundaries, raising their kin or having done so.\n\nThe streets are alive with the laughter of children, the steady rhythm of bikes and rollerblades, the soft pad of dogs led by their masters. Neighbors nod in recognition, aware of who belongs and who is a stranger. A wave from a grill, a smile from a passerby with their dog, are the currency of this place. Lawns are tended with care, green and trim, free from the decay of autumn leaves. Plants and bushes stand in neat array, pruned and orderly. It is not a neighborhood that daunts with grandeur but one that whispers of solace and family, of quiet and safety. It is an average place made exceptional by the promise it holds—a sanctuary at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s department keeps vigil, and the health department stands in its shadow. The city recycling center lies just beyond, a hub for the surrounding folk. Baseball and softball fields echo with the voices of announcers and the names of players, and beside them, a small-town airport sends its planes skyward, their engines a low rumble in the air. Ice cream is within reach, a sweet reward at the end of a walk, and downtown beckons from a distance. My children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away, a testament to the spirit of this place. It is a good place to call home.",
            "In the place where I call home, the landscape is a tapestry of sameness, each thread meticulously placed by the unseen hand of the homeowners' association. Upon crossing the threshold into this suburban sprawl, you are met with a parade of houses, each a mirror to the next, their facades pristine and unyielding. The lawns are kept in a neat patchwork of green, sprinkled with stones for ornament, and short driveways lead to garages built for two. Here and there, a tree stands sentinel, a modest testament to nature’s incursion.\n\nThe roads, freshly paved, snake through this enclave of the ordinary, unmarred by potholes or the scars of time, a testament to the diligence of those who see to such matters. The homes stand mostly single-storied, though some dare to reach higher, their windows like eyes watching the quiet streets. Gone are the solitary mailboxes that once marked each plot; in their stead, a cluster waits at the street’s end, keys clinking in locks as neighbors retrieve their mail and packages from the shared boxes—a nod to the unyielding quest for uniformity.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, this neighborhood is a strange blend of the rural and the suburban, sprawling across ample land. Community pools lie behind gates, inviting yet untroubled, while paths wind through the area, offering solace to those who walk their dogs or seek solitude in the fading light. Parks are unnecessary here; the neighborhood itself is vast enough for any runner’s ambition.\n\nRetirees make up the bulk of this community, eyes watching out for one another, bringing a sense of safety that wraps around you like a well-worn coat. But among them, younger faces emerge—professionals who have found a place here, amidst the quiet.\n\nThe city itself looms larger in number than in spirit, a place where the pulse of a small town beats beneath the skin of a bustling populace. There’s a mall, modest in its offerings but sufficient to the needs of those who wander through its halls. Fifteen minutes is the measure of the distance to the heart of commerce, where stores line the streets, each a promise of goods, from the finest organic markets to the stark shelves of discount outlets.\n\nThis neighborhood is a haven of safety and order, with pools to cool the heat of summer and trails that wind like thoughts through the terrain. And though the shops lie further afield, a short drive delivers you to the doors of any chain you desire, convenience a mere engine's purr away.",
            "I first learned of my dwelling through a podcast about the vanished. Surprising in its own right. This place where apartments fetch a thousand a month and yet tales of the lost lingered unknown. Neither I nor my friends knew of such stories. Perhaps it's the struggle. Some nights, friends weep themselves into restless sleep. The cost of living steep, yet frugality's been our teacher over the years. The scent of flea market relics and mothballed garments becomes familiar, almost comforting. The smells of adulthood, subdued in their presence, cling to you like a second skin. Smoking or simply accustomed, you find the flea market's essence undeniable. Dusty magazines on a silent piano. The scent burrows into leather, stubborn against washing. Here, three thrift stores lie within steps. Start at the far end, wander through charity thrifts, past a library, a rare book shop, and a store of curiosities. Downtown, dense with life, cars and people throng the streets, yet within the thrift's walls, silence prevails. The perfect refuge for an afternoon adrift. Each year, more souls flood the city. A city swelling under the weight of its own burgeoning empire. A place reminiscent of New York, where people pursue their own paths, seldom asking of you. Alone, a quiet independence respected. Not like the South, where curiosity signals care. Here, lives remain unprobed, shells intact as the city ebbs and flows like tides. A place alive, between the pianist next door and the singers above. Strangers in apartments become a community. Needs met, birthdays marked, funerals mourned, aid given. Fortunate to be here, neighbors kind and well-meaning. I return the favor, tidying after myself, sharing food. Mail exchanged. A pleasure to see them, and perhaps they think the same of me. In this vast, impersonal sprawl, it's the neighbors who make it feel less like ruin.",
            "In a small town nestled in the Midwest, there lies the edge of the world, just beyond the reach of the city where the sprawling suburbs give way to a more modest existence. The neighborhood where I dwell stands on the eastern fringe, marked by economic struggle and homes that wear the years in their sagging frames. Low the worth of these lands, where tenants and owners alike count their pennies, yet there is a beauty that resists the sum of its parts. The people who pass by offer a nod, a greeting, their faces lined with stories untold. \n\nCrime has its own dance here, a little more frequent than in other quarters, yet it does not overshadow the day. Tales of violence linger in the air, whispers of past years where blood was spilled not far from where I lay my head. Our next-door neighbors, they lost a son to the night outside a bar where shadows stretch long. But fortune has spared us the worst, our losses confined to what the porch could not guard.\n\nThe town itself bears the scars of a different war, the kind fought with needles and pills. The scourge of opioids, fentanyl a ghostly reaper, has claimed many souls. Yet even in this, there is a battle waged, with centers for healing and hands that train others to bring back the lost from the brink.\n\nAmidst these trials, light finds its way. My son attends a school where the halls hum with a kindness that shields him from life's cruelties. The teachers there, the staff, they are a beacon, and the boy thrives in their care. The community gathers, a PTO that breathes life into the year with events that bind us all together. In a town where poverty stalks one in five, the school offers its children meals freely, a stand against hunger. No child there feels the weight of what they cannot pay.\n\nThe city fathers have turned their gaze to the heart of the town, paving roads, tending to the green, yet the east where I dwell remains a shadow in their plans. The center thrives, the west bustles with commerce, but here on the eastern edge, we wait for the light to reach us.\n\nStill, this town is home. Its people, its schools, the shops that line its streets, they meet our needs. The house we call ours may not boast of wealth, but it holds comfort, and that is its own treasure. Sixteen years we have stood upon this soil, and in our hearts, there lies no desire to be elsewhere.",
            "In the heart of the city stands a neighborhood steeped in tales of its own, perched upon a hill and hemmed in by the memories of structures long past. I dwell in a seven-story apartment, a lone sentinel across from the old theater where once voices soared and stories unfurled. Down the slope, a block away, lies a curious haunt, an arcade bar, where souls converge in the sultry throes of summer nights. June and July see them in clusters, a line snaking along the pavement, each waiting for a moment inside. Not far, the city park sprawls wide, a rare expanse of green amid the urban sprawl. Concrete girds it and stairs run steep, carved into the earth like secrets kept. When winter's breath bites, the homeless come, pitching tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk, the wide steps their refuge. Snow is scarce, but the rain comes relentless, a deluge that chills bones and spirits alike. They huddle close, seeking warmth in the city's core, not far from the family center where solace might be found, a chance to wash away the grime of wandering. But it is not these things that bind me to this place. It is not the grandeur of the past, nor the elegance of architecture that graces the hillsides sloping to the sea. What I cherish is the spirit of the people, the tapestry of lives woven through Hilltop. Once, it was a name spoken in fear, a haven for violence that painted the West Coast red. Stories linger still, whispers of the DEA and federal might sweeping through like a cleansing wind. The people remember, passing tales from one generation to the next, even to newcomers like myself. They toil in earnest, striving to shed the past, to nurture their streets with care and pride. Some say it's unwise to walk Hilltop by night if you're white, a caution rooted in bygone days and the bitter tang of prejudice. Yet, perhaps I tread unnoticed, just dark enough to blend, or maybe Hilltop sees in me a kindred soul, one who knows the weight of history that bears down upon us all. In a city that should be a mosaic of cultures, the old wounds still fester. But the Hilltop is my heart. Walking those streets under the cloak of night, I find life there, a kinship with people more likely to offer a coat than ill intent. It's a place where laundromat lights linger longer for a phone to find power, where I've sat shrouded in the night’s chill, only to be seen, handed a token of humanity, and told I am beautiful and worth something.",
            "I came to this place on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world was as uncertain as the shadows cast by the old elms at dusk. It was not easy to find kin in those early days. Yet I found myself drawn close to a lad who dwelt two doors down and another who lived along the same winding street. Those boys are gone now, their laughter and companionship scattered to the winds, but the echoes of our time remain etched into the fabric of this place. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still here, their lives woven into the quiet tapestry of this American suburb.\n\nThe houses here stand two stories tall, their facades reflecting the sameness of the world in which they stand. On warm days, the voices of children thread through the air, a symphony of innocence and joy. But for the most part, silence reigns here, and I have never found cause for discord among these neighbors. Solitude is a gift in this place, until the hour comes when you seek the hands of others. Packages arrive at my door, untouched by the specter of theft, and I find a strange solace in this trust.\n\nA park lies a stone’s throw from my door, a realm of memories both cherished and unwelcome. There I have played games of sport, felt the sting of a wayward elbow upon my nose, yet the warmth of camaraderie overshadows such fleeting pain. Nowadays, when my feet tread that familiar ground, it is with my cousin’s young ones, their delight in the swings and slides a balm for nostalgia's ache.\n\nThis neighborhood is a patchwork of souls and stories, diverse as the flavors that linger in the air. Within a mile's stride, one finds the spices of China, India, Mexico, and Italy. Yet the folk here often summon their meals through the ether, with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash delivering sustenance to their doors. The fast-food joints hold sway, as they do in many suburbs, their lights a beacon of sameness. Yet there is variety to be found, even an Indian-owned store that beckons with promises of distant lands.\n\nThe shops here are a bounty of necessity and indulgence, from dry cleaners to pharmacies, and the Jewel-Osco, a staple of the Midwest. This place, with its quiet streets and whispers of wind, has become a refuge. Tales from the world beyond, tales of strife and neighborly woe, serve only to deepen my gratitude for the peace I find here.",
            "The world as I find it lies close by the college where I spend my days, and I take some solace in that fact. The landscape is dotted with apartment blocks and the occasional refuge of dining and drink, places that offer a modicum of diversion without too severe a toll on the pocket. A certain tavern recently took on a new name and with it a heftier price, though the spirits and service could be worse. Folks here are largely amiable. They are students or else of modest means, drawn by the low rents. Children abound, their laughter mingling with the breeze from the nearby school. I keep to my own and have no need for the company of neighbors. They indulge in the smoke that clouds the halls, prompting management to install an air freshener outside their door, an action that my companion and I find near comical in its futility. \n\nThe buildings carry the weight of years in their visage though some hide modern interiors. Down the way, new homes rise, hollow in construction yet dressed in high rents, a charade tolerated due to their nearness to the campus. A mere five minutes’ walk finds a cheap eatery where food, served on paper, emerges from the hum of microwaves. Across the street stands a gas station, its reputation as an employer poor. Yet, the city’s hand has touched the road, granting it a fresh face with wide sidewalks and green spaces, an attempt at grace amidst decay. My own dwelling is cushioned by trees, though some have fallen to the axe, leaving behind stumps, reminders of what once was. Behind the apartment lies another street, less cared for, its walkways crumbling, its buildings weary. Trees line the avenue, perhaps to veil the neglect beneath. \n\nCrime is whispered of, particularly from a complex down yonder, though it is not alone in such tales. Across from my own abode, shadows flit through a transient populace, but I find contentment here. It suits my purse, and the conveniences are many—the university a short walk, the buses ready to carry me to the market or into the heart of the town.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawled beneath the wide and endless sky, where duplexes stood in quiet formation along the cul-de-sac, each painted in the same sun-drenched yellow with white porches and roofs of green metal. They seemed to stand as solitary houses, scattered like memories of another time. In the evenings, we gather, a cluster of souls at the end of a driveway not marked by plan or intent, while children spin their worlds in colored chalk and kites that strain against the tethering earth. It is a breath of yesterday in a world too quickened by machines and screens. The fields stretch wide around us, wrapped in the arms of trees, the sky above a canvas of blue and cloud, and yet there is a shadow that leans upon the land.  \n\nIn this season, the air is thick with the threat of storms, and last night the sirens rose, their wail cutting through the stillness, driving us to shelter. I found myself ensconced in the narrow womb of the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, a purse, a few pillows. The large dog refused the sanctuary of the bathroom, pacing and barking in the living room, unsettled by the strangeness of the hour. Outside, the world was silent save for the hammer of hail upon the earth, the neighborhood hushed in anticipation.  \n\nWhen the storm had passed, the road was a river of steam, the heat of the day fleeing before the sudden coolness. The temperature had fallen like a stone, the hail melting as it met the hot ground. I looked up, and the sky was clearing, the sun breaking through to paint a double rainbow across the heavens. I ran inside, fetched my camera, capturing the moment to share with kin and friends far distant, their awe echoing my own.  \n\nThe streets remained still for a time, until the people returned from where they had sought refuge, the rhythm of life resuming its gentle cadence. Mothers and children emerged, the scent of cooking meals drifting on the air. It is a place of warmth and welcome to this stranger from the north, where the voices are wrapped in the soft music of the southern drawl.  \n\nMy dwelling is like all the others, two bedrooms, two baths, though within each lies its own secret, some small, some spacious, a mystery of design. I find solace in the great field behind, where a path winds to a pond not meant for swimming, a place where deer wander and the bullfrog sings his morning song. It is a sanctuary, just beyond the city's reach, where each dawn is heralded by the crow of roosters, the farms that border our small enclave. And in the evening, the bray of a donkey calls out from a nearby farm, a voice in the gathering dusk. This place, this hidden gem of a neighborhood, has offered me its quiet grace.",
            "In the ten years I've wandered this patch of earth, there's been a reckonin' of sorts within me. When first my feet set upon this ground, I was adrift in sorrow. Riverdale lay behind, its memory a shadow clinging close. My tears fell, for I left behind kin and land I loved. But my mama and papa sought a better place, a place where my sister and I could grow like saplings unbent by the wind, in a house they deemed fit for us, in a school unmarred by the ghetto's whisper. \n\nTime, that old relentless river, carried me forward. In its flow, I found companions and foes, both. Of the neighbors, I came to know but a few. Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis, they were all in the circle of my knowing. They've been a solace, almost kin, and for that, I hold them dear. I recall, clear as day, the time when we all went to see Mr. Glen wed anew. It was a day of lightness, a day to dream of for my own future, of a life wrought in gold for some bride to be. When Miss Veda cast her garter into the air, it was I who caught it, though the flowers escaped my grasp. We danced beneath the stars, and I took joy with Marsharii, his daughter, a fleeting presence whose path I hope has led to grander things.\n\nThe streets here wind like a labyrinth, though now with the guide of a GPS, I find time to wander. My feet have carried me as far as they dared with Kason and Curtis at my side. We, who spent our days lost in games and laughter, living each moment as if it were our last. The park calls to me often, a balm for my spirit, offering solace beneath its boughs. There, among the trees, I find my balance with sticks from the depot, wielding my bokken like a samurai of old.\n\nCourts for tennis and basketball stand silent, though they remember the sweat and toil of our games. My father, alongside Mr. Graves, taught us the ways of tennis, and in their training, we found joy. Yes, this place has held many moments of delight, tales etched in the fabric of my being. Yet still, I sense the horizon holds more, a promise of the best yet to unfurl.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies Johnston, a town that whispers its own tales. It's not a place that strikes one as distinct, yet it holds its ground in the world of agriculture. They call it the Peach Capital of the World, a claim that stands bold against the sky on the town’s sign. Fields stretch wide, a patchwork of peach trees and cattle pastures, the land breathing in the sun's relentless gaze. Houses, those not within the town's narrow heart, scatter themselves across the countryside. Some rise two stories high, capped with metal against the summer blaze or clad in gray shingles. They sit back from the road, granting the front fields to animals or crops as though in quiet homage to the land.\n\nIn the town's core, a lone stoplight sways above the crossroads, marking the hub of commerce. A triad of eateries offers solace to the hungry traveler: Hong Kong, a small Chinese enclave run by one family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary’s, a humble burger joint. The pizzeria shuttered its doors not long ago, leaving its absence to echo in the town’s memory. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family pharmacy, finds renown not for its pills but for the Cherry Coca-Cola that bubbles within its walls. Then there’s the IGA, a grocery store both small and dear, where shoppers pick up just a thing or two before heading to the Walmart yonder in Batesburg-Leesville.\n\nDollar General stands as the town's beacon, its shelves laden with the essentials of everyday life, bustling from dawn till dusk. Nearby, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a woman known to all, has stood for a generation. Two men work there, delivering sofas and tables to those who call the town home. Attached is Clark’s Cuts and Kennels, where pets are groomed and tended, their services a comfort to the residents.\n\nA doctor and a veterinarian offer their care on the outskirts, small practices but sufficient. Johnston Elementary holds the town's children until fifth grade, after which they venture to the next town for further schooling. There’s talk of a park, 2.5 acres of promise, where families might gather and outsiders be drawn. For now, the town offers no theaters, no alleys for bowling, no places for idle gathering. But in its quiet, Johnston holds a charm, fleeting as it may be, that lingers even as one passes through, perhaps without noticing at all.",
            "In the small southern town of Tennessee where I live, there's a street that runs between two state highways, drawing more traffic than one might hope for. The neighborhood otherwise drifts in a quiet repose. Folks are settled here, not much coming and going. Faces familiar in the way of old photographs. The people tend to their yards, the rhythm of daily chores marking time. In winter, the children sled down the hill on the side street, laughter echoing in the brittle air. Our house stands at the corner, a sentinel to the comings and goings, and we've grown acquainted with the cars that pass. A strange vehicle catches the eye, a note taken. Neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs, children pedal their bikes, the usual dance of suburb life. We stay home often, working from the house, my wife and I, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. Our presence as much a fixture as the old oak at the edge of the yard. We play outside, even when the rain falls. Sometimes we grill on the back deck, the scent of barbecue a comfort and a call. The sound of lawn mowers is a constant from March to October, when the grass finally yields. The neighborhood is shaded by trees, remnants of the wood that once stood here, and in Fall, leaves carpet the ground, demanding rake and flame. The smell of burning leaves is a harbinger of the season's turn. Winter has grown mild, a long Fall stretching its fingers over the months. Our garage sits at the back, rendering the front door nearly forgotten. When I work on my truck or other projects with the garage doors thrown open, I feel a part of the neighborhood's pulse. Holidays bring a hush over the street, Thanksgiving drawing families together, cars lining the curbs with out-of-town plates. It's the same for Mother's Day, for Christmas. This place is home, settled in the bones. If only it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "In the barren expanse of the high desert where the land stretches out with a relentless constancy of dirt and more dirt and where the horizon is a line of ochre and dust, my neighborhood stands. The brown earth is ever-present, a constant reminder of the sun’s relentless gaze, and where a green lawn emerges it speaks to the wealth of water spent in its keeping. Back in the nineties, the houses lay scattered across the landscape, distant as stars in a vast sky. Now they grow closer, like the slow encroachment of civilization upon a forgotten land, and the city creeps into being with each passing day, a reflection of change echoed in many places.\n\nThe folk here are kind enough, old faces with gentle smiles, and the neighborhood is good, or so it seems, as places go. Chain stores pepper the streets, Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, but for anything finer, the kind that speaks to luxury, you must travel far. Whole Foods and such are strangers to this dust-choked realm. The work that calls most is construction, the skeletal rise of buildings in the open spaces that still linger, and it unnerves me to think of what may come. I left the city once and have no wish to return to its clamor. My own trade is in the craft of walls and ceilings, a labor of hands shaping spaces.\n\nYet there is a beauty here in the starkness, a draw that pulls people to the high desert, a wilderness forged by harsh climate and rugged topography, a home to creatures that wander this arid land. We, who dwell here, must learn to share this place with them, these non-human neighbors, and find a way to live side by side. My family and I, we have made peace with the wild. My children, three in number, chase lizards and insects beneath the sun’s glare, their laughter echoing in the dusty air.\n\nFor those who seek diversion, Victorville offers its own charm, a place where families may find the desert’s heart. The annual San Bernardino County Fair brings its own brand of joy, a blend of tradition and revelry. Venture to Wrightwood to witness snow upon the peaks, to feel the cold bite and perhaps learn the art of winter’s sport. The Victor Valley Museum stands as a testament to the land’s history, with relics of stone and bone, the artifacts of those who walked before us, and the stories of industry and life in this place called Victorville.",
            "When I think on where I live, the truth of it is a place set apart from those who dwell in houses with yards and picket fences. A place that is not a place in the sense of possession but in the sense of habitation. The college campus is the land I call home, and the dormitory my house, and the souls who occupy it my kin. The sprawl of the campus reaches out like a township, its bounds and borders dissolving into the world beyond. Yet for all its peculiarity, it is a neighborhood not unlike any other. There are structures and there are people, there are places to gather and to dwell, places to buy and places to play.\n\nLet us speak of the structures first. There are the apartments, small and clustered, where two to four souls share a room, and the floors stack upon each other like strata of rock in the earth, two deep, housing twenty lives or more. There are the houses, rare and scattered, for those tied to the institution in ways more permanent, alumni who dwell in the past and present all at once. And there are the dormitories, vast and teeming, where hundreds find shelter, two by two, under a single roof. This is the lay of the land.\n\nNow to the people. The school boasts of its diversity, and in truth it is a tapestry of cultures and ages, woven together in this place. The staff inhabit the scattered houses, the young ones fill the dormitories, and the elder students find a home in the apartments. But words alone cannot capture the essence of these people, and so we move on to speak of the stores and parks.\n\nWithin this self-contained world are the places of commerce, the dining halls and shops that bear the school's own mark. All that one seeks can be found within these confines. And there is a park, a common ground where all meet, kept clean and safe by the hands of those who call this place home. A playground for the diverse populace, a testament to the care of the community.\n\nThis then is my neighborhood, a place both peculiar and familiar, a microcosm of life in all its forms.",
            "There are no sidewalks where I live. The land slopes down as if the earth itself is weary, and my house perches atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood. They call it the \"work out hill,\" this incline where joggers labor in their ascent, their footsteps echoing on the hard, unyielding road. The street is a patchwork of pitted asphalt, a test for tires and nerves alike. Overhead, the wires dangle, a tangled web of electric and telephone lines, tattered by storm and time. The rain comes often, a relentless visitor that lashes the trees and tears at the power lines, leaving them mended in a checkered mosaic of repairs.\n\nTall evergreens stand sentinel, their presence a source of contention among the people who live here. They cut them down when they can, these trees that dare obscure the vista of the ocean. The houses climb the hill, glass-fronted and defiant, each seeking the horizon where the bay meets the sky. At sunset the water ignites with an inner flame, the sky a canvas of orange, but more often than not, clouds loom heavy, and the sun's light is but a ghostly glow through the mist. The days are gray, the air heavy with moisture. Moss claims its dominion over roofs, cars, railings, anything it can grasp. I left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned it was a green beast, furred with moss, and it took three hours of scraping to see it shine again.\n\nChildren are scarce in these parts, though a school stands not far off. The neighborhood is a haven for the old, the retired, lives lived in quiet rhythm. Dogs replace the laughter of children, and they roam the yards and chase one another down the street. Leave a door ajar, and you might find one in your living room, a trespasser to be gently shooed away. Rabbits abound, burrowing and rooting, much to the gardeners' despair, yet my cats delight in them, their presence an invitation to hunt. The birds come too, sparrows and hummingbirds flitting among the branches, while hawks and eagles circle until the crows rally to drive them away.\n\nThere are no stores here, but down the hill where the land meets the sea lie a few restaurants, their offerings of fresh seafood a draw to the weary traveler. The shore is rocky, no beach to speak of, only stones to cast into the bay. The water is not wide; you can see the land across, a faint outline even through the ever-present mist.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, if your compass is set for Bensonhurst, you'd find no travail in reaching it. The veins of the city, the subways and buses, carry the echo of a metropolis that never sleeps. Bensonhurst stands a testament to the very heart of New York City. As you tread these streets, be prepared for the sight of Asian emporiums that seem to have sprung as if by some invisible hand. Two decades past, a tide of Asian souls found harbor here, and now their presence marks every block with stores like sentinels in a foreign land. Supermarkets and laundromats, their windows ablaze with neon, call out with the promise of sustenance and cleanliness. The food is good and costs less, a siren’s song for the thrifty. Close by, where I reside, four such markets lie within but a two-minute stroll, a testament to the ease of life’s provisions here.\n\nYet do not think Bensonhurst solely a canvas painted in Asian hues. No, it is a mosaic of the world, a gathering of immigrants and their progeny, a tapestry of first and second-generation Americans. Still, the Asian influence is strong, their hands guiding the most prominent of ventures. Nearby, a park lies renewed, a paradise of play with its courts and fields, swings and fountains where children find joy in the summer’s heat. Diversity reigns here, a harmony of tongues and hues, united in the dance of sport and leisure.\n\nBuildings do not climb to the sky here. They are humble, two-family homes holding their ground against the encroaching shadows of co-ops and condominiums. The people, they are kind but loud, their voices rising with the blare of car radios, engines roaring like beasts unchained, rousing the slumbering dawn.\n\nAs night falls, tread with caution. Bensonhurst is safe, mostly, but the heart of man is a mystery. Trouble lurks in the guise of youth and thieves, shadows that once found me and left their mark. Packages vanish as if by magic, spirited away by unseen hands. And then there is the matter of dogs, their leavings a blight on the streets. It is the law here to clean after them, but the law is a whisper in the wind, often unheard. Daily, the waste litters the path to the train, to the market, a constant companion to the wary traveler. Tread carefully, lest your soles carry the stain of this place.",
            "The first thing you must grasp about Portland, Oregon is the notion of \"weird.\" A phrase scrawled across the backside of a building that stands as a pizza parlor, a bar, a music stage, a den of undress, and skirts the fringes of law like a thin veil, shouts \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it whispers of a bygone era, the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, less known and less dear, where subcultures bloomed like wildflowers in the cracks of pavement. To others, it's a siren's call, beckoning to those who wear their oddities as a badge of honor. Despite the flood of well-heeled Californians and the ceaseless rise of condominiums to shelter them, Portland remains in its peculiar embrace. Yet, weird does not always dance with acceptance, though it opens its arms to the unaccepted. It does not mean we shun the trappings of the modern age or the battles it brings. Like the rest of the land, our goods bear the mark of distant shores. A million shades of weirdness, each hue not quite normal, yet Portland wears its normalcy too: yoga and hipsters and suits of business. Perhaps weird means we hold all this with a lighter heart. In my corner of this city, as in many others, houses boast colors bright, gardens spill with blooms and herbs and vegetables, and the sidewalks are lined with free boxes when summer reigns. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold treasures discarded yet perfect, waiting for the right soul to pass by. A book, a garment, or anything at all might lie within. This magical chance of a stroll through a Southeast neighborhood captures the essence of Portland as I see it, though I am but one among the myriad shades of weird. Some neighbors would not dream of plucking their attire from a sidewalk box. They seek out goat yoga—yes, yoga amidst live goats—or rally their voices at Timbers matches, cheering the city's soccer heroes. Portland brims with souls bound to their passions, some chasing dreams, others dreaming amid the bar’s embrace. Ours is a city with a drug scourge, often rooted deep in the mind’s struggles, the relentless rain and brooding clouds a possible accomplice. Homelessness casts a long shadow, a riddle unsolved. Drawn here by social services more generous than most lands, yet still they fall short. The rest of us sway between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not so strange at all.",
            "The mountains stood eternal, witness to the sun's ancient journey, keeping their vigil in the north. They did not waver, unmoved by the clamor of life, while I, lost in the pursuits of my days, often forgot them. Yet they were always there, demanding to be seen when the weight of the world bore down upon me. I would turn to them, find solace in their stoic presence, and gather strength to carry on, a day at a time. \n\nWhen I first came to this place for my studies, it was those mountains north of the campus that seized my heart. The university had its own charms—grand buildings, tranquil ponds, and whispering trees—but the mountains reigned supreme, an unyielding king. The town itself held beauty, a tapestry of small cafés where time slipped by in caffeine-fueled marathons of study. A few steps more, and the downtown embraced you with its echo of ages, the faded bricks lining the streets, a testament to time's passage. Here, this quiet town found its pulse, a brief surge of city life in the midst of its suburban calm. But the chaos did not stretch far, and beyond the library lay the quiet refuge of small-town peace.\n\nThis city, with its shifting moods, beckoned exploration, each corner a memory waiting to be made. Strolls past the rusty swings in the park after nights without sleep, or dashing through the bustling streets to catch a show at the theater, tickets courtesy of the university. But as with all places, it bore its share of sorrow. The ponds, mirrors of the soul, offered refuge in moments of introspection and tears, the moon high and the hour late, as life's questions loomed large. Watching the birds and insects go about their business, I pondered my place, adrift in the enigma of existence.\n\nAnd so, I wandered past the ponds, past the park, through the neighborhoods with their quiet houses, until I reached the main road. There the sun cast its radiant light upon the palms, painting the sky in hues of dawn. I realized my steps had led me northward. And there they were, as ever, the mountains, brushing the hazy sky with their grandeur. In their silent counsel, I found my resolve, steadfast as the mountains themselves.",
            "You might pass it by, not seeing it at first. It's just a residential area behind a row of shops, a place not much thought of for living. Not for most anyway. But if you wander past the deserted Whole Foods, past the hotels that fill only once a year save for the summer's brief gatherings of kin, you'll find a lively enclave hidden there. On these streets, lined up like those Russian dolls, each apartment block is set down one beside the other, a careful and deliberate array. The first buildings you come to have held stories in the news, tales not fit for repeating, so we'll leave them in their shadows. But beyond them lies another realm, one few know of. Across the street, a quiet campus for a community college stands, a sleepy bastion where students arrive, coffee in hand, stifling yawns in the early hours to start their long days. The iron gates groan wide to let them through, while the commuters grumble in their cars, fists shaking at the delay when the crowd grows thick. The road bends into another, lined with homes, where a park lies on one side and a center for healing broken bones on the other. The rehab place has its porch set with cheerful seats and a fan that churns slowly in the summer's heavy air. Children dash through the park's grass, spinning and laughing among the flowers where bees drone lazily. Elderly folk walk dogs, frowning at the skaters, nodding with a kind of knowing to the girls who whisper secrets by the swings. A strip mall by the park holds a sushi place, never quite busy, and you’ll find a shop for pool supplies and a nail salon beside it, snug and unassuming. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, and eat hibachi all at once—such is the charm of these small-town malls. A frozen yogurt shop is there as well, the kind where you serve yourself, and you’ll see the teens at the park with their cold, dripping cups, doing tricks on skateboards, puffing clouds of vapor, the picture of what they think is cool. This neighborhood, it's a slice of old America, a piece of the quiet South where time seems to stand still and little ever changes.",
            "The neighborhood stands as a relic of another era, where the American dream was once a tangible thing. Houses line the streets, mostly single-family dwellings, but there are those split in two, attached as if in some forgotten symbiosis. My own home sits with a small yard before it, a humble driveway to its side, an echo of a time when the suburbs embraced this nation, now distant and drawing away. Yet this place remains, whispering the dream still breathes, and we clutch at it with the last of our strength.\n\nThe optimism that once painted the faces of the people fades like old photographs. The little yards no longer kept with the same pride, but still, cars rest in the driveways, and the children play as if the world beyond their laughter were nothing but a distant dream. The old school, standing nearly ninety years, seems to hold the future in its walls, a vessel of nostalgia for the elders who pass by. Churches stand few and far between, their pews empty, but the courts where basketballs echo are never silent.\n\nEach house wears a different face yet shares the same soul. A large market, Super \"A,\" held by a Yemeni family, perhaps the sole Arab roots in this soil. The majority here are African American, their stories woven into the fabric of this place. Streets wide and welcoming, where kids play their games, momentarily pausing for the passing cars. Generations have settled here, telling tales of a time when every neighbor was a friend.\n\nOnce there was a karate school. When Hollywood ceased to spin tales of karate kids, the children turned away, and now it stands as a pharmacy, the promise that pills can mend what ails you. A small movie theater clings to life, showing old films at a price the young deem unworthy, but the elders find solace in its dim light, escaping the clamor of youthful ambition.\n\nThe expressway cuts through the town, though its access lies elsewhere. There was a time when a petition called for an exit here, the young cried for it, but the elders held firm in their refusal, fearing it would rend the fabric of their home. A new high school rises, and with it, the debate over a mascot. A cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin, a fitting emblem for this place that straddles the past and the future with a foot in each.",
            "In the sprawling city where I dwell, the neighborhood is a patchwork of lives and places, a mosaic of humanity's ventures. Houses and homes scattered among the commerce of life, as if cast by the hand of some indifferent god. Offices stand beside stores and eateries, theaters of delights and distractions. There is always a new table to lay one's troubles upon or a shop to wander through, seeking what one does not know one seeks. The grand emporiums, names known and whispered across lands, stand shoulder to shoulder with small sanctuaries of goods, boutiques that speak in softer tones and beckon the passerby. They line the thoroughfares, these establishments, and their presence brings a hum to the quarters that would otherwise nest in silence.\n\nThe parks are not far, green havens where mothers and fathers bring their young to bask in the innocence of play. And the people, oh, the people, they are of every kind. Here is a place where the colors of the world mix and mingle, a tapestry woven with threads of many origins. The pride of the LGBTQ+ lives alongside the solemnity of the Orthodox Jew, and the echoes of the Soviet Union find refuge here. Beyond, the city stretches, each enclave a world unto itself, Korea, China, Armenia, and more, each a testament to the journeys of the soul.\n\nBut the roads are long, and the hours pass slowly in the confines of the steel chariots that crawl upon them. A journey of mere miles becomes an odyssey, and the feet of men grow idle. The city sprawls wide, and the habit of walking has withered under the weight of time and distance. Our streets, they are burdened with the ceaseless flow of traffic, a river of iron that knows no peace, and the finding of a place to rest one's vehicle is a quest unto itself.\n\nYet still they come, the builders with their dreams of towering abodes, casting shadows upon the land. A place of allure, yet the hearts of those who dwell here grow weary at the thought of more souls, more wheels upon the roads. The homes are as varied as the people, from grand dwellings to humble abodes, each a story in itself, each a shelter from the world’s chaos. Here families find their refuge, and here, in the quiet corners, the children once played, their laughter a balm against the solitude of the city.\n\nI know not the faces of most who share this place with me. The bonds that once tied us close have slackened, though in the memory of youth, I recall the days when we were kin, neighbors whose doors were always open. Those were the days of sunlight and simplicity, when the world was small and kind.",
            "Where is everything? she asked from the seat beside me, her eyes wide as we drove through the endless stretch of cornfields that framed the world. This is it, I replied, a wry smile on my lips, knowing full well her disbelief in the vacancy of the land. She hailed from a town where a grocery store lay just a stone's throw from her doorstep, where wide-open spaces were a rarity, a myth. But here, amidst the vastness, I unfolded the story of my upbringing in rural Ohio, and in that telling, she began to see the roots that held me. Down that narrow country road, past the fields and the sunlit quarry brimming with water, lay the small enclave where I was born and raised. The houses stood firm in brick and stucco, each claiming half an acre or more, every bit of land a testament to the pride of its keeper. Come spring, flowers burst forth in riotous color, and the trees, ever loyal to the seasons, donned their changing garb. In the driveways, Mercedes Benz cars gleamed, freshly baptized by the hose, their surfaces a mirror to the midday sun. As we neared my gray stucco house, my Korean neighbor waved, his face a map of kindness. He spent his days under the sky, the grass his canvas, and his mower his brush, a song rising above its mechanical drone. We all found joy in his tune, a melody of sincerity, and the stories of his past. Once a doctor, now a part of the landscape, he rode his John Deere as if it were an extension of himself. And finally, my home. In the side yard, the geese gathered, scattering before the exuberant chase of our Terrier. Beyond the house, a stream meandered, singing its quiet song as it flowed toward the quarry. Bullfrogs joined the chorus, their calls mingling with the distant lowing of cattle. Across a bridge crafted by hand, an untouched sanctuary waited, where trees grew wild and herbs and flowers bloomed without hindrance. Here was my realm of childhood, a place of forts built high in branches, of imagined hunts where the chase was the thrill. Always some child nearby, ready to join in the adventure. Winters brought a cold that bit deep, yet with it came a beauty unmatched. The land transformed, the vibrant hues of summer giving way to stark silhouettes of trees, their limbs bare against the sky. Snow, when it came, cloaked everything in silence, a wonderland in white. My sister and I, adversaries in play, took to snowballs as our chosen arms, constructing forts of snow and branch to hold our arsenal. In that frozen world, we found our freedom, children unburdened by the weight of years, lost in the simple joy of being."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies my small town in Michigan, where the old roads meander through farmland and spill into quaint tourist cities. There are no sprawling malls or neon-lit Walmarts, no Targets or even an Applebee’s to speak of. The places you might need lie far off, and travel is a necessity. Yet, despite this, I find myself amidst a beauty unparalleled, encircled by the waters that have cradled this land. My town, if it can be called so, is a peninsula gripped by the arms of Lake Michigan on one flank and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Shores abound where one might wander and feel the cool kiss of the lake upon their feet.\n\nThe neighborhood I call home breathes the essence of small-town life. Houses stand solitary, each with its own story, not replicas of one another, but elder structures, some renewed, others bearing the weight of years. Basements lie beneath, full and visible from the roads that wind by. Aluminum siding clings to many, weathered and strong, and the color of the homes is a patchwork quilt that encircles my own. Yards stretch out before them, where children play upon trampolines and swingsets, where gardens grow and fences keep watch over the creatures within. It is Middle America, a testament to the toils of those who live within its boundaries, raising their kin or having done so.\n\nThe streets are alive with the laughter of children, the steady rhythm of bikes and rollerblades, the soft pad of dogs led by their masters. Neighbors nod in recognition, aware of who belongs and who is a stranger. A wave from a grill, a smile from a passerby with their dog, are the currency of this place. Lawns are tended with care, green and trim, free from the decay of autumn leaves. Plants and bushes stand in neat array, pruned and orderly. It is not a neighborhood that daunts with grandeur but one that whispers of solace and family, of quiet and safety. It is an average place made exceptional by the promise it holds—a sanctuary at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s department keeps vigil, and the health department stands in its shadow. The city recycling center lies just beyond, a hub for the surrounding folk. Baseball and softball fields echo with the voices of announcers and the names of players, and beside them, a small-town airport sends its planes skyward, their engines a low rumble in the air. Ice cream is within reach, a sweet reward at the end of a walk, and downtown beckons from a distance. My children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away, a testament to the spirit of this place. It is a good place to call home.",
            "In the place where I call home, the landscape is a tapestry of sameness, each thread meticulously placed by the unseen hand of the homeowners' association. Upon crossing the threshold into this suburban sprawl, you are met with a parade of houses, each a mirror to the next, their facades pristine and unyielding. The lawns are kept in a neat patchwork of green, sprinkled with stones for ornament, and short driveways lead to garages built for two. Here and there, a tree stands sentinel, a modest testament to nature’s incursion.\n\nThe roads, freshly paved, snake through this enclave of the ordinary, unmarred by potholes or the scars of time, a testament to the diligence of those who see to such matters. The homes stand mostly single-storied, though some dare to reach higher, their windows like eyes watching the quiet streets. Gone are the solitary mailboxes that once marked each plot; in their stead, a cluster waits at the street’s end, keys clinking in locks as neighbors retrieve their mail and packages from the shared boxes—a nod to the unyielding quest for uniformity.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, this neighborhood is a strange blend of the rural and the suburban, sprawling across ample land. Community pools lie behind gates, inviting yet untroubled, while paths wind through the area, offering solace to those who walk their dogs or seek solitude in the fading light. Parks are unnecessary here; the neighborhood itself is vast enough for any runner’s ambition.\n\nRetirees make up the bulk of this community, eyes watching out for one another, bringing a sense of safety that wraps around you like a well-worn coat. But among them, younger faces emerge—professionals who have found a place here, amidst the quiet.\n\nThe city itself looms larger in number than in spirit, a place where the pulse of a small town beats beneath the skin of a bustling populace. There’s a mall, modest in its offerings but sufficient to the needs of those who wander through its halls. Fifteen minutes is the measure of the distance to the heart of commerce, where stores line the streets, each a promise of goods, from the finest organic markets to the stark shelves of discount outlets.\n\nThis neighborhood is a haven of safety and order, with pools to cool the heat of summer and trails that wind like thoughts through the terrain. And though the shops lie further afield, a short drive delivers you to the doors of any chain you desire, convenience a mere engine's purr away.",
            "I first learned of my dwelling through a podcast about the vanished. Surprising in its own right. This place where apartments fetch a thousand a month and yet tales of the lost lingered unknown. Neither I nor my friends knew of such stories. Perhaps it's the struggle. Some nights, friends weep themselves into restless sleep. The cost of living steep, yet frugality's been our teacher over the years. The scent of flea market relics and mothballed garments becomes familiar, almost comforting. The smells of adulthood, subdued in their presence, cling to you like a second skin. Smoking or simply accustomed, you find the flea market's essence undeniable. Dusty magazines on a silent piano. The scent burrows into leather, stubborn against washing. Here, three thrift stores lie within steps. Start at the far end, wander through charity thrifts, past a library, a rare book shop, and a store of curiosities. Downtown, dense with life, cars and people throng the streets, yet within the thrift's walls, silence prevails. The perfect refuge for an afternoon adrift. Each year, more souls flood the city. A city swelling under the weight of its own burgeoning empire. A place reminiscent of New York, where people pursue their own paths, seldom asking of you. Alone, a quiet independence respected. Not like the South, where curiosity signals care. Here, lives remain unprobed, shells intact as the city ebbs and flows like tides. A place alive, between the pianist next door and the singers above. Strangers in apartments become a community. Needs met, birthdays marked, funerals mourned, aid given. Fortunate to be here, neighbors kind and well-meaning. I return the favor, tidying after myself, sharing food. Mail exchanged. A pleasure to see them, and perhaps they think the same of me. In this vast, impersonal sprawl, it's the neighbors who make it feel less like ruin.",
            "In a small town nestled in the Midwest, there lies the edge of the world, just beyond the reach of the city where the sprawling suburbs give way to a more modest existence. The neighborhood where I dwell stands on the eastern fringe, marked by economic struggle and homes that wear the years in their sagging frames. Low the worth of these lands, where tenants and owners alike count their pennies, yet there is a beauty that resists the sum of its parts. The people who pass by offer a nod, a greeting, their faces lined with stories untold. \n\nCrime has its own dance here, a little more frequent than in other quarters, yet it does not overshadow the day. Tales of violence linger in the air, whispers of past years where blood was spilled not far from where I lay my head. Our next-door neighbors, they lost a son to the night outside a bar where shadows stretch long. But fortune has spared us the worst, our losses confined to what the porch could not guard.\n\nThe town itself bears the scars of a different war, the kind fought with needles and pills. The scourge of opioids, fentanyl a ghostly reaper, has claimed many souls. Yet even in this, there is a battle waged, with centers for healing and hands that train others to bring back the lost from the brink.\n\nAmidst these trials, light finds its way. My son attends a school where the halls hum with a kindness that shields him from life's cruelties. The teachers there, the staff, they are a beacon, and the boy thrives in their care. The community gathers, a PTO that breathes life into the year with events that bind us all together. In a town where poverty stalks one in five, the school offers its children meals freely, a stand against hunger. No child there feels the weight of what they cannot pay.\n\nThe city fathers have turned their gaze to the heart of the town, paving roads, tending to the green, yet the east where I dwell remains a shadow in their plans. The center thrives, the west bustles with commerce, but here on the eastern edge, we wait for the light to reach us.\n\nStill, this town is home. Its people, its schools, the shops that line its streets, they meet our needs. The house we call ours may not boast of wealth, but it holds comfort, and that is its own treasure. Sixteen years we have stood upon this soil, and in our hearts, there lies no desire to be elsewhere.",
            "In the heart of the city stands a neighborhood steeped in tales of its own, perched upon a hill and hemmed in by the memories of structures long past. I dwell in a seven-story apartment, a lone sentinel across from the old theater where once voices soared and stories unfurled. Down the slope, a block away, lies a curious haunt, an arcade bar, where souls converge in the sultry throes of summer nights. June and July see them in clusters, a line snaking along the pavement, each waiting for a moment inside. Not far, the city park sprawls wide, a rare expanse of green amid the urban sprawl. Concrete girds it and stairs run steep, carved into the earth like secrets kept. When winter's breath bites, the homeless come, pitching tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk, the wide steps their refuge. Snow is scarce, but the rain comes relentless, a deluge that chills bones and spirits alike. They huddle close, seeking warmth in the city's core, not far from the family center where solace might be found, a chance to wash away the grime of wandering. But it is not these things that bind me to this place. It is not the grandeur of the past, nor the elegance of architecture that graces the hillsides sloping to the sea. What I cherish is the spirit of the people, the tapestry of lives woven through Hilltop. Once, it was a name spoken in fear, a haven for violence that painted the West Coast red. Stories linger still, whispers of the DEA and federal might sweeping through like a cleansing wind. The people remember, passing tales from one generation to the next, even to newcomers like myself. They toil in earnest, striving to shed the past, to nurture their streets with care and pride. Some say it's unwise to walk Hilltop by night if you're white, a caution rooted in bygone days and the bitter tang of prejudice. Yet, perhaps I tread unnoticed, just dark enough to blend, or maybe Hilltop sees in me a kindred soul, one who knows the weight of history that bears down upon us all. In a city that should be a mosaic of cultures, the old wounds still fester. But the Hilltop is my heart. Walking those streets under the cloak of night, I find life there, a kinship with people more likely to offer a coat than ill intent. It's a place where laundromat lights linger longer for a phone to find power, where I've sat shrouded in the night’s chill, only to be seen, handed a token of humanity, and told I am beautiful and worth something.",
            "I came to this place on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world was as uncertain as the shadows cast by the old elms at dusk. It was not easy to find kin in those early days. Yet I found myself drawn close to a lad who dwelt two doors down and another who lived along the same winding street. Those boys are gone now, their laughter and companionship scattered to the winds, but the echoes of our time remain etched into the fabric of this place. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still here, their lives woven into the quiet tapestry of this American suburb.\n\nThe houses here stand two stories tall, their facades reflecting the sameness of the world in which they stand. On warm days, the voices of children thread through the air, a symphony of innocence and joy. But for the most part, silence reigns here, and I have never found cause for discord among these neighbors. Solitude is a gift in this place, until the hour comes when you seek the hands of others. Packages arrive at my door, untouched by the specter of theft, and I find a strange solace in this trust.\n\nA park lies a stone’s throw from my door, a realm of memories both cherished and unwelcome. There I have played games of sport, felt the sting of a wayward elbow upon my nose, yet the warmth of camaraderie overshadows such fleeting pain. Nowadays, when my feet tread that familiar ground, it is with my cousin’s young ones, their delight in the swings and slides a balm for nostalgia's ache.\n\nThis neighborhood is a patchwork of souls and stories, diverse as the flavors that linger in the air. Within a mile's stride, one finds the spices of China, India, Mexico, and Italy. Yet the folk here often summon their meals through the ether, with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash delivering sustenance to their doors. The fast-food joints hold sway, as they do in many suburbs, their lights a beacon of sameness. Yet there is variety to be found, even an Indian-owned store that beckons with promises of distant lands.\n\nThe shops here are a bounty of necessity and indulgence, from dry cleaners to pharmacies, and the Jewel-Osco, a staple of the Midwest. This place, with its quiet streets and whispers of wind, has become a refuge. Tales from the world beyond, tales of strife and neighborly woe, serve only to deepen my gratitude for the peace I find here.",
            "The world as I find it lies close by the college where I spend my days, and I take some solace in that fact. The landscape is dotted with apartment blocks and the occasional refuge of dining and drink, places that offer a modicum of diversion without too severe a toll on the pocket. A certain tavern recently took on a new name and with it a heftier price, though the spirits and service could be worse. Folks here are largely amiable. They are students or else of modest means, drawn by the low rents. Children abound, their laughter mingling with the breeze from the nearby school. I keep to my own and have no need for the company of neighbors. They indulge in the smoke that clouds the halls, prompting management to install an air freshener outside their door, an action that my companion and I find near comical in its futility. \n\nThe buildings carry the weight of years in their visage though some hide modern interiors. Down the way, new homes rise, hollow in construction yet dressed in high rents, a charade tolerated due to their nearness to the campus. A mere five minutes’ walk finds a cheap eatery where food, served on paper, emerges from the hum of microwaves. Across the street stands a gas station, its reputation as an employer poor. Yet, the city’s hand has touched the road, granting it a fresh face with wide sidewalks and green spaces, an attempt at grace amidst decay. My own dwelling is cushioned by trees, though some have fallen to the axe, leaving behind stumps, reminders of what once was. Behind the apartment lies another street, less cared for, its walkways crumbling, its buildings weary. Trees line the avenue, perhaps to veil the neglect beneath. \n\nCrime is whispered of, particularly from a complex down yonder, though it is not alone in such tales. Across from my own abode, shadows flit through a transient populace, but I find contentment here. It suits my purse, and the conveniences are many—the university a short walk, the buses ready to carry me to the market or into the heart of the town.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawled beneath the wide and endless sky, where duplexes stood in quiet formation along the cul-de-sac, each painted in the same sun-drenched yellow with white porches and roofs of green metal. They seemed to stand as solitary houses, scattered like memories of another time. In the evenings, we gather, a cluster of souls at the end of a driveway not marked by plan or intent, while children spin their worlds in colored chalk and kites that strain against the tethering earth. It is a breath of yesterday in a world too quickened by machines and screens. The fields stretch wide around us, wrapped in the arms of trees, the sky above a canvas of blue and cloud, and yet there is a shadow that leans upon the land.  \n\nIn this season, the air is thick with the threat of storms, and last night the sirens rose, their wail cutting through the stillness, driving us to shelter. I found myself ensconced in the narrow womb of the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, a purse, a few pillows. The large dog refused the sanctuary of the bathroom, pacing and barking in the living room, unsettled by the strangeness of the hour. Outside, the world was silent save for the hammer of hail upon the earth, the neighborhood hushed in anticipation.  \n\nWhen the storm had passed, the road was a river of steam, the heat of the day fleeing before the sudden coolness. The temperature had fallen like a stone, the hail melting as it met the hot ground. I looked up, and the sky was clearing, the sun breaking through to paint a double rainbow across the heavens. I ran inside, fetched my camera, capturing the moment to share with kin and friends far distant, their awe echoing my own.  \n\nThe streets remained still for a time, until the people returned from where they had sought refuge, the rhythm of life resuming its gentle cadence. Mothers and children emerged, the scent of cooking meals drifting on the air. It is a place of warmth and welcome to this stranger from the north, where the voices are wrapped in the soft music of the southern drawl.  \n\nMy dwelling is like all the others, two bedrooms, two baths, though within each lies its own secret, some small, some spacious, a mystery of design. I find solace in the great field behind, where a path winds to a pond not meant for swimming, a place where deer wander and the bullfrog sings his morning song. It is a sanctuary, just beyond the city's reach, where each dawn is heralded by the crow of roosters, the farms that border our small enclave. And in the evening, the bray of a donkey calls out from a nearby farm, a voice in the gathering dusk. This place, this hidden gem of a neighborhood, has offered me its quiet grace.",
            "In the ten years I've wandered this patch of earth, there's been a reckonin' of sorts within me. When first my feet set upon this ground, I was adrift in sorrow. Riverdale lay behind, its memory a shadow clinging close. My tears fell, for I left behind kin and land I loved. But my mama and papa sought a better place, a place where my sister and I could grow like saplings unbent by the wind, in a house they deemed fit for us, in a school unmarred by the ghetto's whisper. \n\nTime, that old relentless river, carried me forward. In its flow, I found companions and foes, both. Of the neighbors, I came to know but a few. Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis, they were all in the circle of my knowing. They've been a solace, almost kin, and for that, I hold them dear. I recall, clear as day, the time when we all went to see Mr. Glen wed anew. It was a day of lightness, a day to dream of for my own future, of a life wrought in gold for some bride to be. When Miss Veda cast her garter into the air, it was I who caught it, though the flowers escaped my grasp. We danced beneath the stars, and I took joy with Marsharii, his daughter, a fleeting presence whose path I hope has led to grander things.\n\nThe streets here wind like a labyrinth, though now with the guide of a GPS, I find time to wander. My feet have carried me as far as they dared with Kason and Curtis at my side. We, who spent our days lost in games and laughter, living each moment as if it were our last. The park calls to me often, a balm for my spirit, offering solace beneath its boughs. There, among the trees, I find my balance with sticks from the depot, wielding my bokken like a samurai of old.\n\nCourts for tennis and basketball stand silent, though they remember the sweat and toil of our games. My father, alongside Mr. Graves, taught us the ways of tennis, and in their training, we found joy. Yes, this place has held many moments of delight, tales etched in the fabric of my being. Yet still, I sense the horizon holds more, a promise of the best yet to unfurl.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies Johnston, a town that whispers its own tales. It's not a place that strikes one as distinct, yet it holds its ground in the world of agriculture. They call it the Peach Capital of the World, a claim that stands bold against the sky on the town’s sign. Fields stretch wide, a patchwork of peach trees and cattle pastures, the land breathing in the sun's relentless gaze. Houses, those not within the town's narrow heart, scatter themselves across the countryside. Some rise two stories high, capped with metal against the summer blaze or clad in gray shingles. They sit back from the road, granting the front fields to animals or crops as though in quiet homage to the land.\n\nIn the town's core, a lone stoplight sways above the crossroads, marking the hub of commerce. A triad of eateries offers solace to the hungry traveler: Hong Kong, a small Chinese enclave run by one family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary’s, a humble burger joint. The pizzeria shuttered its doors not long ago, leaving its absence to echo in the town’s memory. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family pharmacy, finds renown not for its pills but for the Cherry Coca-Cola that bubbles within its walls. Then there’s the IGA, a grocery store both small and dear, where shoppers pick up just a thing or two before heading to the Walmart yonder in Batesburg-Leesville.\n\nDollar General stands as the town's beacon, its shelves laden with the essentials of everyday life, bustling from dawn till dusk. Nearby, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a woman known to all, has stood for a generation. Two men work there, delivering sofas and tables to those who call the town home. Attached is Clark’s Cuts and Kennels, where pets are groomed and tended, their services a comfort to the residents.\n\nA doctor and a veterinarian offer their care on the outskirts, small practices but sufficient. Johnston Elementary holds the town's children until fifth grade, after which they venture to the next town for further schooling. There’s talk of a park, 2.5 acres of promise, where families might gather and outsiders be drawn. For now, the town offers no theaters, no alleys for bowling, no places for idle gathering. But in its quiet, Johnston holds a charm, fleeting as it may be, that lingers even as one passes through, perhaps without noticing at all.",
            "In the small southern town of Tennessee where I live, there's a street that runs between two state highways, drawing more traffic than one might hope for. The neighborhood otherwise drifts in a quiet repose. Folks are settled here, not much coming and going. Faces familiar in the way of old photographs. The people tend to their yards, the rhythm of daily chores marking time. In winter, the children sled down the hill on the side street, laughter echoing in the brittle air. Our house stands at the corner, a sentinel to the comings and goings, and we've grown acquainted with the cars that pass. A strange vehicle catches the eye, a note taken. Neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs, children pedal their bikes, the usual dance of suburb life. We stay home often, working from the house, my wife and I, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. Our presence as much a fixture as the old oak at the edge of the yard. We play outside, even when the rain falls. Sometimes we grill on the back deck, the scent of barbecue a comfort and a call. The sound of lawn mowers is a constant from March to October, when the grass finally yields. The neighborhood is shaded by trees, remnants of the wood that once stood here, and in Fall, leaves carpet the ground, demanding rake and flame. The smell of burning leaves is a harbinger of the season's turn. Winter has grown mild, a long Fall stretching its fingers over the months. Our garage sits at the back, rendering the front door nearly forgotten. When I work on my truck or other projects with the garage doors thrown open, I feel a part of the neighborhood's pulse. Holidays bring a hush over the street, Thanksgiving drawing families together, cars lining the curbs with out-of-town plates. It's the same for Mother's Day, for Christmas. This place is home, settled in the bones. If only it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "In the barren expanse of the high desert where the land stretches out with a relentless constancy of dirt and more dirt and where the horizon is a line of ochre and dust, my neighborhood stands. The brown earth is ever-present, a constant reminder of the sun’s relentless gaze, and where a green lawn emerges it speaks to the wealth of water spent in its keeping. Back in the nineties, the houses lay scattered across the landscape, distant as stars in a vast sky. Now they grow closer, like the slow encroachment of civilization upon a forgotten land, and the city creeps into being with each passing day, a reflection of change echoed in many places.\n\nThe folk here are kind enough, old faces with gentle smiles, and the neighborhood is good, or so it seems, as places go. Chain stores pepper the streets, Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, but for anything finer, the kind that speaks to luxury, you must travel far. Whole Foods and such are strangers to this dust-choked realm. The work that calls most is construction, the skeletal rise of buildings in the open spaces that still linger, and it unnerves me to think of what may come. I left the city once and have no wish to return to its clamor. My own trade is in the craft of walls and ceilings, a labor of hands shaping spaces.\n\nYet there is a beauty here in the starkness, a draw that pulls people to the high desert, a wilderness forged by harsh climate and rugged topography, a home to creatures that wander this arid land. We, who dwell here, must learn to share this place with them, these non-human neighbors, and find a way to live side by side. My family and I, we have made peace with the wild. My children, three in number, chase lizards and insects beneath the sun’s glare, their laughter echoing in the dusty air.\n\nFor those who seek diversion, Victorville offers its own charm, a place where families may find the desert’s heart. The annual San Bernardino County Fair brings its own brand of joy, a blend of tradition and revelry. Venture to Wrightwood to witness snow upon the peaks, to feel the cold bite and perhaps learn the art of winter’s sport. The Victor Valley Museum stands as a testament to the land’s history, with relics of stone and bone, the artifacts of those who walked before us, and the stories of industry and life in this place called Victorville.",
            "When I think on where I live, the truth of it is a place set apart from those who dwell in houses with yards and picket fences. A place that is not a place in the sense of possession but in the sense of habitation. The college campus is the land I call home, and the dormitory my house, and the souls who occupy it my kin. The sprawl of the campus reaches out like a township, its bounds and borders dissolving into the world beyond. Yet for all its peculiarity, it is a neighborhood not unlike any other. There are structures and there are people, there are places to gather and to dwell, places to buy and places to play.\n\nLet us speak of the structures first. There are the apartments, small and clustered, where two to four souls share a room, and the floors stack upon each other like strata of rock in the earth, two deep, housing twenty lives or more. There are the houses, rare and scattered, for those tied to the institution in ways more permanent, alumni who dwell in the past and present all at once. And there are the dormitories, vast and teeming, where hundreds find shelter, two by two, under a single roof. This is the lay of the land.\n\nNow to the people. The school boasts of its diversity, and in truth it is a tapestry of cultures and ages, woven together in this place. The staff inhabit the scattered houses, the young ones fill the dormitories, and the elder students find a home in the apartments. But words alone cannot capture the essence of these people, and so we move on to speak of the stores and parks.\n\nWithin this self-contained world are the places of commerce, the dining halls and shops that bear the school's own mark. All that one seeks can be found within these confines. And there is a park, a common ground where all meet, kept clean and safe by the hands of those who call this place home. A playground for the diverse populace, a testament to the care of the community.\n\nThis then is my neighborhood, a place both peculiar and familiar, a microcosm of life in all its forms.",
            "There are no sidewalks where I live. The land slopes down as if the earth itself is weary, and my house perches atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood. They call it the \"work out hill,\" this incline where joggers labor in their ascent, their footsteps echoing on the hard, unyielding road. The street is a patchwork of pitted asphalt, a test for tires and nerves alike. Overhead, the wires dangle, a tangled web of electric and telephone lines, tattered by storm and time. The rain comes often, a relentless visitor that lashes the trees and tears at the power lines, leaving them mended in a checkered mosaic of repairs.\n\nTall evergreens stand sentinel, their presence a source of contention among the people who live here. They cut them down when they can, these trees that dare obscure the vista of the ocean. The houses climb the hill, glass-fronted and defiant, each seeking the horizon where the bay meets the sky. At sunset the water ignites with an inner flame, the sky a canvas of orange, but more often than not, clouds loom heavy, and the sun's light is but a ghostly glow through the mist. The days are gray, the air heavy with moisture. Moss claims its dominion over roofs, cars, railings, anything it can grasp. I left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned it was a green beast, furred with moss, and it took three hours of scraping to see it shine again.\n\nChildren are scarce in these parts, though a school stands not far off. The neighborhood is a haven for the old, the retired, lives lived in quiet rhythm. Dogs replace the laughter of children, and they roam the yards and chase one another down the street. Leave a door ajar, and you might find one in your living room, a trespasser to be gently shooed away. Rabbits abound, burrowing and rooting, much to the gardeners' despair, yet my cats delight in them, their presence an invitation to hunt. The birds come too, sparrows and hummingbirds flitting among the branches, while hawks and eagles circle until the crows rally to drive them away.\n\nThere are no stores here, but down the hill where the land meets the sea lie a few restaurants, their offerings of fresh seafood a draw to the weary traveler. The shore is rocky, no beach to speak of, only stones to cast into the bay. The water is not wide; you can see the land across, a faint outline even through the ever-present mist.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, if your compass is set for Bensonhurst, you'd find no travail in reaching it. The veins of the city, the subways and buses, carry the echo of a metropolis that never sleeps. Bensonhurst stands a testament to the very heart of New York City. As you tread these streets, be prepared for the sight of Asian emporiums that seem to have sprung as if by some invisible hand. Two decades past, a tide of Asian souls found harbor here, and now their presence marks every block with stores like sentinels in a foreign land. Supermarkets and laundromats, their windows ablaze with neon, call out with the promise of sustenance and cleanliness. The food is good and costs less, a siren’s song for the thrifty. Close by, where I reside, four such markets lie within but a two-minute stroll, a testament to the ease of life’s provisions here.\n\nYet do not think Bensonhurst solely a canvas painted in Asian hues. No, it is a mosaic of the world, a gathering of immigrants and their progeny, a tapestry of first and second-generation Americans. Still, the Asian influence is strong, their hands guiding the most prominent of ventures. Nearby, a park lies renewed, a paradise of play with its courts and fields, swings and fountains where children find joy in the summer’s heat. Diversity reigns here, a harmony of tongues and hues, united in the dance of sport and leisure.\n\nBuildings do not climb to the sky here. They are humble, two-family homes holding their ground against the encroaching shadows of co-ops and condominiums. The people, they are kind but loud, their voices rising with the blare of car radios, engines roaring like beasts unchained, rousing the slumbering dawn.\n\nAs night falls, tread with caution. Bensonhurst is safe, mostly, but the heart of man is a mystery. Trouble lurks in the guise of youth and thieves, shadows that once found me and left their mark. Packages vanish as if by magic, spirited away by unseen hands. And then there is the matter of dogs, their leavings a blight on the streets. It is the law here to clean after them, but the law is a whisper in the wind, often unheard. Daily, the waste litters the path to the train, to the market, a constant companion to the wary traveler. Tread carefully, lest your soles carry the stain of this place.",
            "The first thing you must grasp about Portland, Oregon is the notion of \"weird.\" A phrase scrawled across the backside of a building that stands as a pizza parlor, a bar, a music stage, a den of undress, and skirts the fringes of law like a thin veil, shouts \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it whispers of a bygone era, the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, less known and less dear, where subcultures bloomed like wildflowers in the cracks of pavement. To others, it's a siren's call, beckoning to those who wear their oddities as a badge of honor. Despite the flood of well-heeled Californians and the ceaseless rise of condominiums to shelter them, Portland remains in its peculiar embrace. Yet, weird does not always dance with acceptance, though it opens its arms to the unaccepted. It does not mean we shun the trappings of the modern age or the battles it brings. Like the rest of the land, our goods bear the mark of distant shores. A million shades of weirdness, each hue not quite normal, yet Portland wears its normalcy too: yoga and hipsters and suits of business. Perhaps weird means we hold all this with a lighter heart. In my corner of this city, as in many others, houses boast colors bright, gardens spill with blooms and herbs and vegetables, and the sidewalks are lined with free boxes when summer reigns. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold treasures discarded yet perfect, waiting for the right soul to pass by. A book, a garment, or anything at all might lie within. This magical chance of a stroll through a Southeast neighborhood captures the essence of Portland as I see it, though I am but one among the myriad shades of weird. Some neighbors would not dream of plucking their attire from a sidewalk box. They seek out goat yoga—yes, yoga amidst live goats—or rally their voices at Timbers matches, cheering the city's soccer heroes. Portland brims with souls bound to their passions, some chasing dreams, others dreaming amid the bar’s embrace. Ours is a city with a drug scourge, often rooted deep in the mind’s struggles, the relentless rain and brooding clouds a possible accomplice. Homelessness casts a long shadow, a riddle unsolved. Drawn here by social services more generous than most lands, yet still they fall short. The rest of us sway between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not so strange at all.",
            "The mountains stood eternal, witness to the sun's ancient journey, keeping their vigil in the north. They did not waver, unmoved by the clamor of life, while I, lost in the pursuits of my days, often forgot them. Yet they were always there, demanding to be seen when the weight of the world bore down upon me. I would turn to them, find solace in their stoic presence, and gather strength to carry on, a day at a time. \n\nWhen I first came to this place for my studies, it was those mountains north of the campus that seized my heart. The university had its own charms—grand buildings, tranquil ponds, and whispering trees—but the mountains reigned supreme, an unyielding king. The town itself held beauty, a tapestry of small cafés where time slipped by in caffeine-fueled marathons of study. A few steps more, and the downtown embraced you with its echo of ages, the faded bricks lining the streets, a testament to time's passage. Here, this quiet town found its pulse, a brief surge of city life in the midst of its suburban calm. But the chaos did not stretch far, and beyond the library lay the quiet refuge of small-town peace.\n\nThis city, with its shifting moods, beckoned exploration, each corner a memory waiting to be made. Strolls past the rusty swings in the park after nights without sleep, or dashing through the bustling streets to catch a show at the theater, tickets courtesy of the university. But as with all places, it bore its share of sorrow. The ponds, mirrors of the soul, offered refuge in moments of introspection and tears, the moon high and the hour late, as life's questions loomed large. Watching the birds and insects go about their business, I pondered my place, adrift in the enigma of existence.\n\nAnd so, I wandered past the ponds, past the park, through the neighborhoods with their quiet houses, until I reached the main road. There the sun cast its radiant light upon the palms, painting the sky in hues of dawn. I realized my steps had led me northward. And there they were, as ever, the mountains, brushing the hazy sky with their grandeur. In their silent counsel, I found my resolve, steadfast as the mountains themselves.",
            "You might pass it by, not seeing it at first. It's just a residential area behind a row of shops, a place not much thought of for living. Not for most anyway. But if you wander past the deserted Whole Foods, past the hotels that fill only once a year save for the summer's brief gatherings of kin, you'll find a lively enclave hidden there. On these streets, lined up like those Russian dolls, each apartment block is set down one beside the other, a careful and deliberate array. The first buildings you come to have held stories in the news, tales not fit for repeating, so we'll leave them in their shadows. But beyond them lies another realm, one few know of. Across the street, a quiet campus for a community college stands, a sleepy bastion where students arrive, coffee in hand, stifling yawns in the early hours to start their long days. The iron gates groan wide to let them through, while the commuters grumble in their cars, fists shaking at the delay when the crowd grows thick. The road bends into another, lined with homes, where a park lies on one side and a center for healing broken bones on the other. The rehab place has its porch set with cheerful seats and a fan that churns slowly in the summer's heavy air. Children dash through the park's grass, spinning and laughing among the flowers where bees drone lazily. Elderly folk walk dogs, frowning at the skaters, nodding with a kind of knowing to the girls who whisper secrets by the swings. A strip mall by the park holds a sushi place, never quite busy, and you’ll find a shop for pool supplies and a nail salon beside it, snug and unassuming. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, and eat hibachi all at once—such is the charm of these small-town malls. A frozen yogurt shop is there as well, the kind where you serve yourself, and you’ll see the teens at the park with their cold, dripping cups, doing tricks on skateboards, puffing clouds of vapor, the picture of what they think is cool. This neighborhood, it's a slice of old America, a piece of the quiet South where time seems to stand still and little ever changes.",
            "The neighborhood stands as a relic of another era, where the American dream was once a tangible thing. Houses line the streets, mostly single-family dwellings, but there are those split in two, attached as if in some forgotten symbiosis. My own home sits with a small yard before it, a humble driveway to its side, an echo of a time when the suburbs embraced this nation, now distant and drawing away. Yet this place remains, whispering the dream still breathes, and we clutch at it with the last of our strength.\n\nThe optimism that once painted the faces of the people fades like old photographs. The little yards no longer kept with the same pride, but still, cars rest in the driveways, and the children play as if the world beyond their laughter were nothing but a distant dream. The old school, standing nearly ninety years, seems to hold the future in its walls, a vessel of nostalgia for the elders who pass by. Churches stand few and far between, their pews empty, but the courts where basketballs echo are never silent.\n\nEach house wears a different face yet shares the same soul. A large market, Super \"A,\" held by a Yemeni family, perhaps the sole Arab roots in this soil. The majority here are African American, their stories woven into the fabric of this place. Streets wide and welcoming, where kids play their games, momentarily pausing for the passing cars. Generations have settled here, telling tales of a time when every neighbor was a friend.\n\nOnce there was a karate school. When Hollywood ceased to spin tales of karate kids, the children turned away, and now it stands as a pharmacy, the promise that pills can mend what ails you. A small movie theater clings to life, showing old films at a price the young deem unworthy, but the elders find solace in its dim light, escaping the clamor of youthful ambition.\n\nThe expressway cuts through the town, though its access lies elsewhere. There was a time when a petition called for an exit here, the young cried for it, but the elders held firm in their refusal, fearing it would rend the fabric of their home. A new high school rises, and with it, the debate over a mascot. A cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin, a fitting emblem for this place that straddles the past and the future with a foot in each.",
            "In the sprawling city where I dwell, the neighborhood is a patchwork of lives and places, a mosaic of humanity's ventures. Houses and homes scattered among the commerce of life, as if cast by the hand of some indifferent god. Offices stand beside stores and eateries, theaters of delights and distractions. There is always a new table to lay one's troubles upon or a shop to wander through, seeking what one does not know one seeks. The grand emporiums, names known and whispered across lands, stand shoulder to shoulder with small sanctuaries of goods, boutiques that speak in softer tones and beckon the passerby. They line the thoroughfares, these establishments, and their presence brings a hum to the quarters that would otherwise nest in silence.\n\nThe parks are not far, green havens where mothers and fathers bring their young to bask in the innocence of play. And the people, oh, the people, they are of every kind. Here is a place where the colors of the world mix and mingle, a tapestry woven with threads of many origins. The pride of the LGBTQ+ lives alongside the solemnity of the Orthodox Jew, and the echoes of the Soviet Union find refuge here. Beyond, the city stretches, each enclave a world unto itself, Korea, China, Armenia, and more, each a testament to the journeys of the soul.\n\nBut the roads are long, and the hours pass slowly in the confines of the steel chariots that crawl upon them. A journey of mere miles becomes an odyssey, and the feet of men grow idle. The city sprawls wide, and the habit of walking has withered under the weight of time and distance. Our streets, they are burdened with the ceaseless flow of traffic, a river of iron that knows no peace, and the finding of a place to rest one's vehicle is a quest unto itself.\n\nYet still they come, the builders with their dreams of towering abodes, casting shadows upon the land. A place of allure, yet the hearts of those who dwell here grow weary at the thought of more souls, more wheels upon the roads. The homes are as varied as the people, from grand dwellings to humble abodes, each a story in itself, each a shelter from the world’s chaos. Here families find their refuge, and here, in the quiet corners, the children once played, their laughter a balm against the solitude of the city.\n\nI know not the faces of most who share this place with me. The bonds that once tied us close have slackened, though in the memory of youth, I recall the days when we were kin, neighbors whose doors were always open. Those were the days of sunlight and simplicity, when the world was small and kind.",
            "Where is everything? she asked from the seat beside me, her eyes wide as we drove through the endless stretch of cornfields that framed the world. This is it, I replied, a wry smile on my lips, knowing full well her disbelief in the vacancy of the land. She hailed from a town where a grocery store lay just a stone's throw from her doorstep, where wide-open spaces were a rarity, a myth. But here, amidst the vastness, I unfolded the story of my upbringing in rural Ohio, and in that telling, she began to see the roots that held me. Down that narrow country road, past the fields and the sunlit quarry brimming with water, lay the small enclave where I was born and raised. The houses stood firm in brick and stucco, each claiming half an acre or more, every bit of land a testament to the pride of its keeper. Come spring, flowers burst forth in riotous color, and the trees, ever loyal to the seasons, donned their changing garb. In the driveways, Mercedes Benz cars gleamed, freshly baptized by the hose, their surfaces a mirror to the midday sun. As we neared my gray stucco house, my Korean neighbor waved, his face a map of kindness. He spent his days under the sky, the grass his canvas, and his mower his brush, a song rising above its mechanical drone. We all found joy in his tune, a melody of sincerity, and the stories of his past. Once a doctor, now a part of the landscape, he rode his John Deere as if it were an extension of himself. And finally, my home. In the side yard, the geese gathered, scattering before the exuberant chase of our Terrier. Beyond the house, a stream meandered, singing its quiet song as it flowed toward the quarry. Bullfrogs joined the chorus, their calls mingling with the distant lowing of cattle. Across a bridge crafted by hand, an untouched sanctuary waited, where trees grew wild and herbs and flowers bloomed without hindrance. Here was my realm of childhood, a place of forts built high in branches, of imagined hunts where the chase was the thrill. Always some child nearby, ready to join in the adventure. Winters brought a cold that bit deep, yet with it came a beauty unmatched. The land transformed, the vibrant hues of summer giving way to stark silhouettes of trees, their limbs bare against the sky. Snow, when it came, cloaked everything in silence, a wonderland in white. My sister and I, adversaries in play, took to snowballs as our chosen arms, constructing forts of snow and branch to hold our arsenal. In that frozen world, we found our freedom, children unburdened by the weight of years, lost in the simple joy of being."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies a place carved out by the hand of time, a small town in Michigan where the land stretches from fields of toil to the quiet hum of tourist havens. A place far removed from the sprawling embrace of city malls, where no Wal-mart or Target casts its fluorescent glow, and the name Applebee’s is but a whisper carried on the wind. To reach any destination requires the journey of wheels, yet in this pocket of the world, beauty unfurls in a tapestry of water and sky. Here, the city is cradled by the arms of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other, each offering the solace of shores where the weary can rest their feet in the cool embrace of sand.\n\nThe neighborhood echoes the song of small town life, where houses stand apart like solitary guardians, each with its own tale to tell. They are not the mirrored dreams of suburban sprawl, but homes of age and character, some bearing the marks of renewal, others holding fast to their roots. Basements lie beneath them, seen from the road, while aluminum siding speaks of years gone by. The spectrum of homes is a kaleidoscope of hues, each standing in testament to the spirit of Middle America, where labor is the currency of life, and families weave their stories in the fabric of days.\n\nChildren roam the streets with laughter in their wake, while dogs lead their masters on journeys of discovery. The rhythm of wheels on pavement sings of bikes and rollerblades tracing the paths between neighbors. Here, faces are familiar, and the bond of community is a gentle thing. A wave to the one grilling in the yard or a smile to the lone wanderer with their dog is the language of belonging. Lawns are tended with the care of stewards, leaves banished to the memory of autumn. Grass is kept in check, and gardens flourish in their quiet rebellion against the march of time.\n\nThis is not the kind of place that dazzles the eye with grandeur, but rather one that whispers of home in the language of peace and safety. It is a place where the soul finds its haven at day’s end. Nearby, the county sheriff’s department stands watch, and the health department offers its hand. The city’s recycling center hums with purpose, serving all who seek its aid. Baseball fields echo with the calls of announcers, names of players carried on the breeze. The small town airport lies beyond, a place where the sky is alive with the rumble of engines, marking the passage of time in the rhythm of flight.\n\nIce cream awaits the wanderer’s step, a sweet reward for the journey downtown. Parks lie within reach, a mere eight blocks from home, where children can ride their bikes and dreams take flight. This is a place where the heart finds its rest, where life moves at the pace of a gentle walk, and the world is a tapestry of the ordinary made extraordinary.",
            "The place where I make my home is like an endless sea of sameness, a sprawling suburbia carved from the earth in neat rows and parcels, each a mirror reflection of the next. A place where the hand of the homeowner's association has pressed firm upon the land. As you enter, it's a tableau of single-story houses, each kept with a precision that might seem unnatural were it not the edict of the association. The lawns are small and manicured, the grass trimmed and bordered by stones, the driveways short. There are trees, but they stand like sentinels, spaced deliberately and at intervals decided by those who rule this place. Every home has its double garage, a place for the vehicles that ferry their owners to the larger world beyond.\n\nThe roads are new-laid, a smooth expanse of concrete unmarred by time or weather, for there are no potholes to mar the journey here. The houses, mostly low and sprawling, sometimes rise to a second story, but not often. And the mailboxes speak of a collective mind, grouped together at the street's end like the mail slots of an apartment complex, keys granting access to their secrets.\n\nMy house lies on the city's fringe, where suburb meets the wild land beyond. It's a place with space enough for all things, where community pools shimmer behind their gates, kept clean and welcoming. Trails wind through the place for those who wish to walk alone or with a dog at their side, the paths leading nowhere and everywhere. There's no need for a park; the neighborhood's vastness provides.\n\nThe people here are mostly those who have laid down their burdens, the retirees who watch the world with gentle eyes, ensuring the safety of all. Among them are a few who still carry the weight of work, the middle-aged and the young, though they are outnumbered.\n\nThe city near us is large by the count of souls within it but small in its heart. It holds the things one needs, the mall that serves its purpose without excess. It takes a drive to reach the places of commerce, a fifteen-minute journey to the stores that line the streets, offering goods from the organic to the ordinary. A place where all things can be found if one knows where to look.\n\nThis is the neighborhood I call home. A place safe and tended, with its amenities and its ordered ways. A place where the world waits just beyond the horizon, a car ride away, ready to be embraced when needed.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place it was a voice on a podcast. A voice speaking of those who vanished as if swallowed whole by the earth. It was a strange thing to hear about a spot where every flat and lodging fetched thousandfold a month. None had spoken of it before. Not my friends nor the whispers in the streets. Perhaps it's the struggle. I know friends who shed tears into the night, alone in their rooms. The cost of things weighs heavy but we've learned the ways of thrift. The dusty scent of flea market relics and mothballed garments has become familiar. In adulthood, you breathe less deep of the world. Perhaps you take up smoking or perhaps you simply grow used to the state of things. Yet the flea market lingers in your senses. The scent of grown years is dusty pages stacked high on a forgotten piano. It seeps into the leather, defies the wash. In this place, three thrift stores are but a stone's throw. Start at one end and you find charity shops, a library, a rare book haven, and a store of curiosities. Downtown thrums with the pulse of cars and people in the morning but within the thrift's walls, all is silence. A refuge for lost hours. The city swells each year, spilling over with life. They call it a place of growth, headquarters to a sprawling empire of commerce and delivery, still raw with the pangs of its own becoming. It brings to mind New York, where each soul pursues their own course and little is asked of you. Here you can be alone and unseen, free of inquiry. Not as in the South where care is shown in its asking. Here you keep your own counsel as long as you will, the city itself receding like the tide upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound. The pianist next door, the singers above. A community in the guise of strangers. We share in our needs, mark the passage of life and death, lend aid where we can. In this, I'm fortunate. I find kinship with my neighbors and they with me. I clean my space and leave food and they do likewise. We trade letters and greetings. They are a light in the sprawl of this vast and cold city. It is through them I find that perhaps I have not lost my life entirely.",
            "In the heart of the Midwest, a town sits quietly, a whisper away from the sprawling suburbs of the city. It is a place marked by the weight of its own history, where the east side bears the scars of hardship etched into the very bones of the earth. Houses lean with the years, inhabited by those who tread the hard margin of life, their walls a testament to endurance. Yet, the streets speak a softer truth, lined with folk who nod and greet as one passes by, faces that carry stories of their own. Crime casts a shadow, yes, but it is a shadow familiar and not all-consuming. It has touched us lightly, sparing our own though others have not been so fortunate. The neighbors next door know the hollow loss that violence brings, their son taken from them outside a bar, the echo of gunfire a reminder of life's fragility.\n\nThe opioid scourge has laid its heavy hand upon us, fentanyl taking its toll, and the town mourns with a collective sigh. But as with all things, there is resistance. Places of healing dot the town, and the people arm themselves with knowledge and Narcan, standing vigil against the tide. Beneath these struggles lie gems of hope. My son's school stands as a bastion of light, where kindness is not a rarity and all children are given their due, a place where he has found acceptance despite the world’s indifference. The school feeds its young, ensuring no child knows hunger, and the community gathers to bolster one another, to lift as they climb.\n\nThe town's council has turned its gaze to the heart of the town, roads smoothed and parks renewed, though our eastern edge remains rough-hewn and raw, a point of quiet contention among us. Still, there is a fondness here, a quiet satisfaction in the familiarity of these streets, in the unassuming nature of life as it unfolds. Shops, both humble and grand, meet our needs, and though our home may not boast wealth, it holds comfort and memory in its walls. Sixteen years we have called this place ours, and the thought of elsewhere seems a distant dream, for here, amid the struggle and the grace, we have found our home.",
            "The neighborhood sits atop a hill, folding its arms around the stories of old stones and timeworn theaters. I dwell in a seven-story edifice, a sentinel across from the ancient playhouse, while the arcade bar at the foot of The Hill hums with the clamor of diverse souls drawn like moths to the summer’s glow. June and July birth queues that snake along the street, the people lined like pilgrims awaiting entry to some sacred rite. A few blocks up, the city park sprawls, a green lung amid the concrete, its grandeur unexpected in this quarter of the town. Encircling it, the cement holds fast, stairs carved into its flesh like the scars of battles past. Winter’s breath sets the homeless to their labor, erecting tents in regimented rows along the sidewalk, a testament to survival against the merciless rain that hammers down in the heart of the season. They cluster close, defying the chill, clinging to the warmth of the city’s core, the family center their beacon—a place to cleanse the grit from their bodies.\n\nYet it is the people, not the stones, that hold my heart. For Hilltop’s fame was once darkened by the shadow of gang wars, whispers still echoing of federal sweeps that sought to scour the streets clean. The tales endure, passed from father to son, mother to daughter, even to newcomers like myself. The folk labor with fervor, though the world may label their home a den of danger. They cherish their streets, their stories. They warn the pale faces to steer clear when night drapes its cloak, a caution rooted in days gone by, its taste bitter from the draught of prejudice. Perhaps I walk those streets, my skin a shade ambiguous, as one of them, marked not by color but by an understanding of the wounds that linger.\n\nThe Hilltop is an anchor. Its streets pulse with life, and in the dimming day, I find kinship among those who would offer a coat rather than seek to take from me. Here, laundromat doors stretch ajar a moment longer, granting refuge from the relentless rain, a place to breathe and charge the lifeline of a phone. Here, in the shadows, believing myself unseen, a stranger’s kindness alights upon me with a simple gift and the words of worth—reminders that even in a world splintered by ignorance and fear, there are pockets of grace, where humanity shines through the cracks.",
            "I came to this place with the ringing of the eighth grade in my ears, a time when the world seemed as vast as the sky and as distant. Friends were scarce at first, like shadows at dusk, but soon enough I found kinship in a boy from two doors down and another from further along the street. They've long since left, yet their spirits linger in the recesses of memory. The faces peering out from behind curtains remain much the same as when I first arrived. This neighborhood is the likeness of a thousand others, steeped in the cadence of suburbia. Houses rise in two-story uniformity, standing sentry over the quietude. On warm days, the air fills with the laughter of children, a chorus against the stillness of the week. Here, no quarrel has found me, and solitude is respected unless aid is sought. Packages come and go from my porch, untouched by the world's grasping hands, a testament to trust unbroken. Just beyond the reach of my doorstep lies a park, a mere heartbeat away, where memories are etched in sand and sweat. There, the games of youth were played—basketball, football, baseball—all amid the camaraderie of familiar faces. Yet it was there too, beneath the indifferent gaze of the sky, that pain found me in the form of an elbow to the nose. But such is life, where joy eclipses sorrow. Now, the park is a place of nostalgia, its swings and slides the stage for my cousin's children, their laughter a balm to old wounds. The mere thought of it stirs a longing for that which is past. Diversity blooms in this place, a tapestry of flavors within a stone's throw—Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian—all vying for attention. Yet convenience has its price, as the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash draw people away from the heart of it all. Fast food reigns supreme, as ubiquitous as the suburban dream. The stores are plentiful, offering all that one might seek. Dry cleaners stand at the ready, while Walgreens and CVS face off across the street, and the Jewel-Osco stands sentinel, a Midwestern staple. Even among the aisles, diversity whispers its presence, with an Indian-owned store offering a taste of home or a ready-made escape. In sum, this place is a sanctuary in a world of discord. I read of the trials others face with their neighbors and find myself thankful for the peace that envelops me here, a quiet gratitude in a world gone mad.",
            "The college stands but a short walk from the place I lay my head, and for that I am given to a certain fondness for this quarter. The architecture is predominantly of the apartment sort, though there are establishments for eating and drinking that offer a modest diversion. One of these watering holes has taken on a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though the spirits and service are not without their merits. The folk here are, on the whole, agreeable. Young scholars or those of modest means, they find shelter in these affordable walls. Children are a common sight, their presence owed to the nearby school which sits within a stone's throw of my abode. Of my neighbors, I know little and wish for less. Their penchant for the herb has led to the management installing a device of fragrance at their threshold, which my companion and I find a curious sort of jest. The edifices here are aged in their appearance, though perhaps they've been tended to within. Along the way, new apartments have sprouted, though their making is suspect, a mirage of prosperity at a dear cost. A roadside eatery dispenses its fare on paper, warmed by the hum of microwaves, while a gas station stands opposite, whispered to be a place of ill employment. Yet, the city saw fit to mend the road, laying down a broad walk with stretches of green, lending a touch of grace to the surroundings. Trees enshroud my dwelling, their number diminished but still present in greater abundance than farther afield. Beyond my enclave lies another street, less favored by fortune, where the path is broken and the structures weary. Trees abound there too, perhaps to cloak the weathered facades. The specter of crime is not unknown here, the blame shared across the way and beyond. Yet, I find a certain contentment in this place. It suits my purse and offers what I need. The nearness of the university and the convenience of the buses grant me ease in my comings and goings.",
            "The neighborhood lay in a quiet cul-de-sac where the duplexes stood like sentinels, each painted a shade of yellow with white porches and roofs of green metal glinting under the sun. They seemed to be individual houses, scattered without much order, though their common paint betrayed their kinship. Friendships forged in the spaces between them, folks standing at unmarked driveways in the soft folds of evening, speaking low while children tangled with their toys or scratched pictures onto the sidewalks with chalk. It was a refuge from the yawning maw of the modern world, a place caught in amber where time slithered slowly. Fields and trees wrapped the neighborhood in a verdant embrace, under skies vast and blue, clouds like drifting ships.\n\nYet, the tranquility was brittle. The season carried the weight of storms, and last night the sirens wailed their grim warning. We sought shelter, I with my small dog clutched tightly, purse and pillows in hand, as the big dog howled alone in the living room, uneasy in the unnatural calm. The world outside was a drum of hail, the earth steaming where the stones met the hot ground. The temperature plummeted, ninety-two to seventy-five, the hail dissolving upon impact. The skies cleared, and rain fell with the sun's return, painting a double rainbow across the heavens. I fetched my camera, capturing the spectacle to share with those far and wide, though the streets held their silence still, the world encased in the aftermath of storm.\n\nIn time, the quiet broke, folks returning home, the neighborhood breathing life anew. Women called to their children as dinner simmered, and the air was thick with camaraderie. I, newly arrived from New Hampshire to this southern land, found comfort in the lilt of voices, the slow, rolling cadence of the Southern drawl. The home I made in this place mirrored its neighbors, two bedrooms and two baths, though inside, they were not as kin. Some apartments were narrow as a stream, others more generous, an odd puzzle of space.\n\nBeyond my door, the world unfurled. A field spread wide, beckoning with the promise of solitude, a pond lay beyond, still and dark, not for swimming but for contemplation. Deer moved like shadows, and the bullfrog sang his morning song, a basso profondo echoing through the dawn. It was a good place, forty minutes from the city yet a world away, where roosters heralded the break of day and a donkey's bray marked the dusk. I found a haven here, a small community unto itself, a fortunate find amid the vast sprawl of the world.",
            "In the ten years since I came to this place, I reckon I've seen a thing or two worth telling. When I left Riverdale for Stockbridge, it was like stepping into a different world. I remember the tears, the way I cried for the life I left behind, the people I loved. But my folks, they had their reasons. They wanted more for me and my sister, a place where the houses were better, the schools better, a place that was not what folks called ghetto.  \n\nTime passed and the place grew on me. Made friends, made enemies too, as one does in those halls of learning. The neighbors mostly remained distant, shadows in the periphery, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis too, who lived just over the way. They became like kin to me in a manner of speaking, and I held them dear. There was a time when my family and I went to see Mr. Glen tie the knot anew. A wedding it was, a grand affair, full of laughter and dance. I caught the garter but missed the flowers as they sailed through the air. And we danced, oh how we danced, with Marsharii, his daughter, though she's gone her own way now. I hope the world has been kind to her.  \n\nThe neighborhood, it’s a tangle of streets and paths, a maze that I’ve come to know, mostly by the grace of a GPS, exploring when time allows. My friends Kason and Curtis, we’d wander those streets, lost in the joy of video games and the freedom of youth. Some days I’d find solace in the park, the quiet of nature soothing the soul. There, with sticks from the depot, I’d test my balance, wield my wooden sword, a bokken, in simple play.  \n\nA court for basketball, another for tennis, though I haven't picked up a racket in years. My dad, he taught me and my best friend the ways of tennis with Mr. Graves. They pushed us hard, but there was joy in it, a simple pleasure. This place, it holds memories, stories etched in the fabric of time. Yet I feel the best is yet to come, waiting just over the horizon.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a humble town where time seems to linger and the sun casts long shadows over fields of ripening peaches. Johnston they call it, with a sign at the edge of town proclaiming its pride as the Peach Capital of the World. It is a place of quiet industry, where the land whispers tales of toil and harvest, and the people move with the rhythm of seasons. Farmland stretches out like a tapestry woven with peach trees and cattle, the houses set back from the road, two stories tall with roofs of metal or gray shingles to withstand the summer’s relentless blaze.\n\nWithin the town’s core, a solitary stoplight dangles at a crossroads, marking the hub of commerce where the only stores congregate. There’s Hong Kong, a small Chinese eatery run by a family whose roots intertwine with the town’s soil. Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, where the air is thick with the scent of cumin and chili, and Gary's, serving burgers with a side of nostalgia. The pizzeria that once stood has fallen silent, its ovens cold. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a modest pharmacy, is famed not for its medicine but for its sweet elixir of Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, stands as the lone outpost for provisions, though many journey to Batesburg-Leesville’s Walmart for their weekly sustenance.\n\nDollar General is where the town’s pulse quickens, its aisles a refuge for all manner of need. Across the way, a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is tended by a woman who knows all who pass through her door. Her goods are delivered by two faithful movers, known throughout Johnston. Next to her domain, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures, offering a menagerie of services from grooming to boarding.\n\nOn the outskirts, a doctor and a vet tend to the bodies and beasts of Johnston, their practice small but sufficient. The children learn their letters at Johnston Elementary, moving on to distant halls for the schooling of their teenage years. Parks are absent, yet the town dreams of a 2.5-acre haven for families to wander and play, a beacon to draw new souls to its fold.\n\nIn truth, Johnston offers little in the way of diversion. No screens flicker in darkened theaters, no pins tumble in alleys of polished wood. Yet it is a place of quiet charm, a town so slight you might pass it by without a second glance, though its memory lingers like the sweet scent of peaches on a summer breeze.",
            "In the small southern town where I make my home, there is a street threading like a quiet stream between two state highways. A place of passage, yes, with a fretful tally of traffic more than the heart might ask for. Yet beyond that, it's a neighborhood of stillness, where folks have settled into their lives as a hand fits a glove. The faces here have grown familiar, etched into the days like the slow erosion of stone, and each morning is greeted by the customary hum of chores as if the world itself were wound to that rhythm. In the colder months, there is the hill on the side street where children gather, their laughter the only sound against the hush of winter’s breath. Our house sits sentinel at the corner, eyes watching the comings and goings, always knowing the shape and color of the cars that pass. We note those which are strange to us, those that do not belong, as one marks the passage of a cloud.\n\nThe neighbors, they walk their dogs or themselves, and children ride their bikes, weaving through the tapestry of the street. Ours is a home tethered to the land, for we work from it, my wife and I, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen, each day finding us in and out, part of the neighborhood’s pulse. Sometimes, in defiance of the rain, we step outside to play beneath the heavy, gray sky. The grill on the back deck sends its scent upon the air, the smoke of meat and char an offering to the quiet gods of the street. There is the constant whirr of lawnmowers, a hymn of the grass, from March until October’s end when the earth grows weary of its growing. Trees stand as sentinels, remnants of the wood that once was, offering shade and in the fall, a cascade of leaves to be raked and burned, their smoke a harbinger of the season’s turning. Our winters have grown soft, more akin to a protracted autumn, and the front door remains mostly unused, the garage at the back our favored portal.\n\nDays of celebration are hushed affairs. Thanksgiving brings a scattering of unfamiliar cars, kin from distant places come to visit, their presence like a brief flicker of light. It is much the same for Christmas and Mother’s Day. In the quietude of this place, I find a contentment that is near to perfect. If only the road did not draw so many travelers, it might be a haven unmarred.",
            "In the heart of the high desert where the earth lies bare and endless, a land of dirt and dust and more dirt still, my neighborhood sits unassumingly. To live here is to know the unyielding presence of brown, a relentless hue that swallows the horizon. A patch of green here is an extravagance, a testament to the fortune spent on coaxing life from this arid soil. In the nineties, this place stretched wide and sparse, the houses scattered like seeds flung by some careless hand. Now, the city creeps closer, a slow encroachment of concrete and glass, a march toward some inevitable urban sprawl. Yet the soul of the desert remains, unbroken and vast. \n\nThe folks here, mostly, are kind as desert folk tend to be, though like any city, it has its shadows. I live among the old ones, their faces worn by sun and time, and it is a comforting place. The shops are those you'd expect, chains familiar to any traveler, but for finer things, one must venture beyond. Whole Foods and its ilk are strangers here, the city not yet ripe for such indulgence. Construction is the blood of this place, the promise of growth in the wide-open spaces. It is a thought that sits uneasy with me, for I left the rush of city life and have no desire to return to it. My work is in this field, shaping homes from drywall and T-bar, a craft that ties me to the earth here.\n\nWhat I cherish, though, are the creatures that call this land home. The desert, in its stark beauty, harbors life that thrives against the odds. In knowing these non-human neighbors, we find a way to live in harmony. My children, wild with curiosity, chase lizards and desert bugs, their laughter echoing in the dry air as they hunt their tiny prizes. \n\nThere are wonders here for those who seek them. Victorville offers a taste of desert life, a different kind of beauty that takes hold slowly. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is a gathering of joy and tradition, a celebration of this place we call home. Nearby, the mountains of Wrightwood rise, their snowy peaks a contrast to the desert below, offering lessons in winter's sports. And for those drawn to the stories of old, the Victor Valley Museum stands, a keeper of tales told in stone and bone, in the artifacts of those who walked this land before us.\n\nIn this desert, the days stretch long and the nights whisper with the voices of the past. It is a place where time slips by like sand through fingers, where one can find both solitude and kinship. And in the quiet moments, when the wind stirs the dust and the sun sinks low, I am reminded of the simple truth: this land, for all its harshness, is home.",
            "In the place I call my own, where the paths wind through halls of learning and the sun spills its light on the old stones of the campus, there lies a neighborhood not bound by picket fences or streetlamps but by the souls who wander its spaces. This place where I dwell is a college, its sprawling grounds a patchwork of lives intertwined. Here, the dormitory walls cradle those I call my own. We, the dwellers of this academic realm, are a peculiar kind of kin. \n\nThe houses of this place are not houses in the usual sense. There are the tall dormitories rising like sentinels in the dusk, rooms stacked high where two to a room live and dream and learn. In their shadow lie apartments, smaller and more private, where the elder students find refuge. Two floors they rise, and within each, the buzz of twenty souls at least. Beyond these, scattered like leaves in the wind, are houses for those who belong to the school in other ways. Alumni mostly, and they are few, for their kind is less common here.\n\nThe heart of this neighborhood beats with a diversity unmatched. People of all creeds and colors, those who have come from afar and those born close, all find their place. The staff, keepers of knowledge, dwell in the houses, while the new students fill the dorms and the seasoned ones take the apartments.\n\nShops and stores, they line the paths, catering to every need, each a world within walls. A park lies at the edge, a sanctuary for the weary and the wanderers. It is a ground kept clean by those who tread it, a haven from the pressures of the world. This is my neighborhood, a tapestry of lives woven together, where every soul finds its place in the grand design.",
            "There are no sidewalks in the place where I live. The world slopes away from my door and the house sits perched on the crest of a hill that folks call the workout hill for the joggers who labor up its incline each day. Without a path to guide them, they walk the blacktop road, pitted and worn, hazardous in its way. The wires that snake around the block hang in tatters, victims of the storms that rage through, laying waste to trees and lines, the repairs a patchwork testament to the fury of the elements. Tall evergreens stand sentinel, but they're not welcome here. They fall beneath the axe, for they block the view of the ocean, the houses built high, glass-fronted and looming, each a witness to the bay's beauty. Come sunset, the waters catch fire beneath the sky's orange glow, though more often clouds shroud the sun, leaving the light to filter through a haze. The days are overcast and damp, moss creeping over all it touches, roofs and cars and railings turned green in its embrace. I left my car out for a month, and it was swallowed by the moss, three hours of scraping to reclaim it. Children are few, though a school lies near, the neighborhood mostly the domain of the old, retirees who have traded children for dogs. They roam the lawns and race the streets, slipping through open doors to claim the warmth of a stranger's home. I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it back into the world it knew. Rabbits run wild here, bold and burrowing, the gardeners' bane, yet beloved by my cats who have hunted them to near extinction. Birds flit and flutter, sparrows and hummingbirds, while hawks and eagles are driven off by the crows, protectors of this place. There are no stores to speak of, but the hike downhill leads to the waterfront where restaurants serve the sea's bounty. No beach lies there, only rocks to hurl into the bay, the opposite shore visible through the mist that clings to the days.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies the neighborhood of Bensonhurst, a place where the city hum persists, and the pulse of New York City is ever felt. To find this enclave is no chore, for the veins of public transit reach all through it, making the journey seamless and swift. The streets bear witness to the tides of change, for in the past decades, an influx of Asian souls has woven a new tapestry upon this urban fabric. As you wander, the signs of their presence are unmistakable, each block adorned with Asian-owned stores—their neon signs casting a glow in the evening haze, supermarkets and laundromats thriving where once were others. Here, the food is fresh, the prices fair, and the convenience a balm for the hurried heart of the city dweller. Four such markets stand within mere steps of one another, a testament to the world's smallness.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not solely the domain of one people. It is a mosaic, a patchwork of lives and stories, immigrants and their progeny, each contributing to the hum of life that fills the air. The echoes of their voices and the rhythm of their lives are woven into the very fabric of this place.\n\nNearby, a park stands renewed, a sanctuary of sorts amidst the city sprawl. There, courts for basketball and handball, fields for soccer and baseball, await those in search of play. Children’s laughter rings out from the playground, and in summer, water fountains offer their cooling embrace. Here too, the diversity of the city is reflected in the faces of those who gather, united in the spirit of sport and leisure.\n\nThe skyline of Bensonhurst is not punctuated by the towers of commerce, but by the more humble abodes of co-ops and condominiums, where families find their homes. The streets are lined with the low houses of two families, and the air is filled with the sound of life. Cars pass by, their music a rolling soundtrack, and engines roar to greet the dawn.\n\nWhen night falls, a cloak of caution is advised. Though the streets are mostly safe, the shadows can conceal those who mean harm. Memories linger of past encounters, specters of bullies and thieves who once roamed these streets. Packages, left unguarded, are known to vanish, spirited away by unseen hands. And then, there is the matter of the dogs, whose owners heed not the city's edicts. The pavements bear witness to their neglect, and each step must be taken with care, lest one's shoes bear the mark of their oversight.\n\nSo, tread carefully and keep your eyes open, for Bensonhurst is a place where the past and present converge, where the city's heartbeat is strong, and the stories of its people are written anew each day.",
            "In the city of Portland, Oregon, there is a saying painted on the back of a building that hosts a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, and perhaps more than it should by law. Keep Portland Weird, it reads. And what is this weirdness they speak of? For some, it is a whisper from a time when the city was not so well known, nor so expensive, when the streets bred a different kind of life, creative and wild. A time before the influx of those from the south, before the skyscrapers of concrete and glass rose to greet the clouds. For others, it is a call to arms, an invitation to a city where the odd is embraced, where peculiar is but a shade of charm.\n\nDespite the coming of the new, the affluent, the ever-rising walls of condominiums, Portland clings to this strangeness. It does not mean all is welcome, but it does mean there is room for what elsewhere might be pushed away. This city does not turn from the modern world, nor the battles it brings. Portland buys its goods from distant lands just as the rest, and in its heart are a million ways to be strange, to walk a path not marked by the footsteps of others. Yet among this, there is normalcy. There is yoga and the hipsters and those who wear ties and carry briefcases. Perhaps to be weird here is to wear these things with less weight, to let them slide from your shoulders.\n\nIn the neighborhood where I find myself, the houses are painted in colors that seem plucked from a dream. The gardens are full of life, flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets as if they might spill over and cover the world. In the summer, one might find a free box sitting on a corner, a simple container with gifts inside, discarded by one and waiting for another. It might be cardboard or plastic, but inside is the magic of the unexpected, a treasure waiting for the right eyes to see it. Clothes, books, anything at all might lie within.\n\nThis is the heart of Portland for me, and I am but one among the myriad. There are those who would never dream of taking what they wear from a box on the street. They might find their joy in yoga with goats or in cheering for the Timbers, the city's proud soccer team. Portland is a place where hearts beat for a thousand different things. A place where dreams are chased or left to linger in the dim light of a bar.\n\nThere is darkness here too. A problem with drugs that is perhaps a shadow of the mind's own struggles. The rain falls heavy and long, the clouds like a shroud, and they say it weighs upon the soul. There are those without homes, drawn by the promise of help that is better than most but not enough. And those who have homes are torn between compassion and disdain. In this, perhaps, there is nothing strange at all.",
            "The mountains stood steadfast in the north, sentinels of the sun’s passage, day after day, night after night. They watched with an ancient patience, unyielding as the earth itself. In the clamor of daily life, in the grind of tasks and trials, they were there, silent and solemn. And when those days came, when the world seemed a weight unbearable, they compelled my gaze. They let me lay my weary spirit upon their shoulders, lending strength to carry just one more day. I came to this place when my journey of learning began, drawn by the northern peaks that loomed over the campus. The university had its own beauty, in the form of grand facades and tranquil ponds, trees that whispered secrets to the wind. Yet it was the mountains that held dominion over my heart. The town sprawled out, beautiful in its own right, with cafés that cradled the hours of caffeine-fueled toil. A brief walk or a bus ride brought one to the heart of downtown, where the bricks, faded and weary, whispered tales of a time gone by. Here, this suburban town took on the guise of an urban sprawl, bustling with life, yet the clamor faded quickly as one passed the library, retreating once more into the quietude of small-town life. This juxtaposition of worlds, so close and yet so distinct, gave the city a wonder that called out to be known. Memories were born here, each tied to a place—a stroll past rusted swings after a night without sleep, a mad dash through the bustling streets to a theater where the university gifted glimpses of art. And yet, as all places are, it was a canvas for life’s harsher strokes. The ponds, those mirrors to the sky, served both as places of contemplation and as refuges for tears shed in the depths of night’s despair. I knew those nights well. Watching the turtles and ducks, the dance of insects upon the water, I pondered my place in this great tapestry, my purpose amid the endless enigma of existence. And so I walked, past the ponds, past the parks, past the quiet cries of suburban homes, until I found myself upon a main street. The sun, in its ascent, cast its light upon the palms, painting the heavens with hues of dawn. I looked up then, and saw I was moving north. There they were, as they had always been, the mountains touching the sky with their towering grace. And as if speaking in silence, they stirred within me a resolve to endure.",
            "You might pass it by without a second thought, for it lies behind the faded facades of commerce, where few would think to find a place called home. But there it is, behind the derelict Whole Foods, past the transient hotels that only stir with life in the warmth of summer reunions. Here, a hidden township hums with its own life. Streets lined with apartments, each complex nestled like Russian dolls, meticulously disassembled and aligned down the crooked lane. The first cluster is known for its tales of misdeeds, whispered about on late-night news, yet we shall not linger there. For beyond lies another realm unknown to most who tread the mundane paths of this land.\n\nAcross the way stands the satellite campus of a modest college, its silent buildings standing guard. Students trickle in with the early light, coffee in hand, eyes heavy with the weight of morning. Iron gates creak and groan, admitting them one by one, while the impatient chorus of commuters rises—a symphony of honking horns and muttered curses at delayed passage. The road leads to another, where a park and a center for mending broken bodies coexist. The center, with its cheerful veranda, watches the world turn, a lazy fan stirring the thick air of summer. Children tumble across the green, their joy a sharp contrast to the bees that drift lazily among the wildflowers.\n\nOld souls shuffle along the path with their canine companions, casting disapproving glances at the youth on their wheeled boards, yet offering nods to the girls who gather, whispering of love and fleeting fame. Nearby, a strip mall stands—a sushi joint with its modest fare, a pool supply store, and a nail salon sandwiched between. Here, one could prepare for summer, indulge in a manicure, and savor hibachi all in a single breath. A frozen yogurt shop sits within, where the young often seek reprieve from the sun, clutching dripping cups as they skate and puff on their devices, convinced of their own coolness.\n\nThis neighborhood is but a slice of the old America, a relic in the languid south where time moves as slow as the syrupy air, and change is a stranger seldom seen.",
            "In the neighborhood where I live, the old houses hunker down like weathered sentinels of another time. Most stand alone, single-family dwellings, but here and there a house has been split, conjoined like some forlorn conjoined twin. My home sits with its small yard out front and a narrow driveway to the side, and it whispers of a past when this suburbia was the heart of an American dream that now drifts like smoke, elusive and distant. Yet the streets still echo with the remnants of that dream, holding on with a quiet resilience, beckoning those who pass through to remember. The people here, their optimism faded like the paint on their weather-beaten homes, tend the little yards with a lesser care, and yet the driveways still cradle a car or two. Children play in the streets, their laughter bright against the backdrop of a world that feels like all there is.\n\nThe schoolhouse, standing sentinel for near ninety years, seems to spin futures from the dust of nostalgia, binding the youth to a history the elders recall with a fond ache. Churches dot the landscape like forgotten relics, their pews empty, while the basketball courts pulse with life. Each house wears a different face, yet the spirit within feels kindred. A supermarket, Super “A,” is run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the lone Arab souls among the largely African American residents who weave the tapestry of this place. Wide streets stretch out, where kids dash after footballs, pausing only as cars inch past, a dance of youth and steel.\n\nGenerations have sunk roots here, and each resident seems to carry stories of a time when everyone knew everyone else. There was a karate school once, but with the passing of the karate kid dreams, it gave way to a pharmacy, where remedies of another kind are dispensed. A little movie theater, offering old films at a price that spares few, is a sanctuary for the elders who relish a night away from the youthful clamor. An expressway cuts through, though its exits and entrances lie just beyond our reach, a contested line where the elders’ wisdom ruled over the young’s desire for connection.\n\nA new high school rises, and in its shadow, we ponder what symbol might capture the spirit of this town. I think a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin might just fit the mold of this place, a fusion of past and future, as absurd as it is fitting.",
            "In the vast sprawl of the city where I make my home, the streets wind through a mosaic of life and commerce. Here, the neighborhoods unfurl like patches on an old quilt, stitched together by the invisible hands of time and circumstance. The shops and eateries, places of human gathering and solitude alike, stand scattered among the dwellings as if cast there by the whims of some ancient god. You find the grand facades of corporate empires shoulder to shoulder with humble boutiques, their windows a testament to the timeless dance of ambition and dream. The streets are alive with the tread of those seeking the new, the novel, and the familiar comforts of the old. Yet alongside these bustling avenues, quiet parks lay nestled—a refuge for the laughter of children and the soft murmur of leaves.\n\nIn this tapestry of urban life, the people are as varied as the stars in a cold, clear night. A place where the colors of the world blend and stand apart, a testament to humanity's ceaseless migration and settlement. Here lives a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, there the solemn presence of Orthodox Jewry, and the echoes of the old Soviet lands in the voices of newcomers. Beyond the borders of my own corner of the city, the world expands with neighborhoods named for far places, Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—each a world within a world, where the old ways are not forgotten, nor entirely remembered.\n\nBut to traverse these distances, even the briefest of miles, is to wrestle with the ceaseless tide of traffic. The city's arteries clogged with metal and rubber, each movement a test of patience. Few take to the streets on foot, for the city is a vast, sprawling beast, and her distances are not for the faint of heart. Yet the city grows, relentless as the tide, new buildings rising from its depths, promising sanctuary and promise, but to many, only the specter of more and more and more.\n\nAnd so, the city harbors its multitude of abodes, from the grand towers reaching skyward to the low, humble homes nestled in their shadows. There are those who seek the solitude of their own plot of earth, others content with the company of neighbors above and below. Each street, each house, a story. My own neighborhood, a crossroads of ages and stories, where each face is a mystery, each life a narrative unwritten to my eyes. It is not the place of my childhood, where the streets rang with the shouts of play and the bonds of those young and untested by time. But the echoes remain, a soft whisper in the heart of a city that never truly sleeps.",
            "Where is everything she asked. Her eyes wide as we drove past the cornfields stretching out to meet the sky. This is it I said. The sparseness of the land a shock to her senses. She lived in a place where the grocery store was a five-minute walk from her door and the sky was crowded with rooftops. Never seen such space this side of anywhere. I told her of the life in rural Ohio. How it was to rise and sleep under this open sky. And she came to know me then. The road a ribbon of gravel beneath us. Leading past a quarry filled with water like an old wound. The development where I lived just beyond. The houses standing in their brick and stucco silence. Each with half an acre or more to its name. Tended with a pride as old as the land itself. In the springtime the flowers rise like a promise kept. The midwestern trees shedding their leaves in a slow dance through the seasons. The driveways filled with cars polished to a shine. Mercedes Benz gleaming under the sun’s eye. Onward we drove toward my home. Grey stucco against the wide sky. My Korean neighbor always out with a smile. Mowing the grass or singing over the mower's hum. His laughter a part of the air we breathed. Once a doctor they say. Now blending with the grass and his John Deere. Age taking its toll but not his spirit. And there my home. Geese in the side yard scattered by the Terrier's chase. A stream out back feeding into the quarry. Bullfrogs croaking low and deep. The stream murmuring its secrets. The moo of distant cattle carried on the wind. Across a bridge of wood handmade and worn lies an oasis untouched. Trees and herbs and wildflowers growing as they will. This was my childhood's haunt. A place of forts and wild hunts of chasing nothing but shadows and dreams. Winters came hard and sharp. The land stripped bare but for its beauty. Branches skeletal against the sky. Snowfall turning the world to white overnight. Angels of snow lining the yard. My sister's handiwork. Snowmen standing guard in their silence. We fought my sister and I. Snowballs our chosen arms. Forts built of snow and branches our bastions. In this world nothing else mattered. We were children then. Untethered and free."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies a place carved out by the hand of time, a small town in Michigan where the land stretches from fields of toil to the quiet hum of tourist havens. A place far removed from the sprawling embrace of city malls, where no Wal-mart or Target casts its fluorescent glow, and the name Applebee’s is but a whisper carried on the wind. To reach any destination requires the journey of wheels, yet in this pocket of the world, beauty unfurls in a tapestry of water and sky. Here, the city is cradled by the arms of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other, each offering the solace of shores where the weary can rest their feet in the cool embrace of sand.\n\nThe neighborhood echoes the song of small town life, where houses stand apart like solitary guardians, each with its own tale to tell. They are not the mirrored dreams of suburban sprawl, but homes of age and character, some bearing the marks of renewal, others holding fast to their roots. Basements lie beneath them, seen from the road, while aluminum siding speaks of years gone by. The spectrum of homes is a kaleidoscope of hues, each standing in testament to the spirit of Middle America, where labor is the currency of life, and families weave their stories in the fabric of days.\n\nChildren roam the streets with laughter in their wake, while dogs lead their masters on journeys of discovery. The rhythm of wheels on pavement sings of bikes and rollerblades tracing the paths between neighbors. Here, faces are familiar, and the bond of community is a gentle thing. A wave to the one grilling in the yard or a smile to the lone wanderer with their dog is the language of belonging. Lawns are tended with the care of stewards, leaves banished to the memory of autumn. Grass is kept in check, and gardens flourish in their quiet rebellion against the march of time.\n\nThis is not the kind of place that dazzles the eye with grandeur, but rather one that whispers of home in the language of peace and safety. It is a place where the soul finds its haven at day’s end. Nearby, the county sheriff’s department stands watch, and the health department offers its hand. The city’s recycling center hums with purpose, serving all who seek its aid. Baseball fields echo with the calls of announcers, names of players carried on the breeze. The small town airport lies beyond, a place where the sky is alive with the rumble of engines, marking the passage of time in the rhythm of flight.\n\nIce cream awaits the wanderer’s step, a sweet reward for the journey downtown. Parks lie within reach, a mere eight blocks from home, where children can ride their bikes and dreams take flight. This is a place where the heart finds its rest, where life moves at the pace of a gentle walk, and the world is a tapestry of the ordinary made extraordinary.",
            "The place where I make my home is like an endless sea of sameness, a sprawling suburbia carved from the earth in neat rows and parcels, each a mirror reflection of the next. A place where the hand of the homeowner's association has pressed firm upon the land. As you enter, it's a tableau of single-story houses, each kept with a precision that might seem unnatural were it not the edict of the association. The lawns are small and manicured, the grass trimmed and bordered by stones, the driveways short. There are trees, but they stand like sentinels, spaced deliberately and at intervals decided by those who rule this place. Every home has its double garage, a place for the vehicles that ferry their owners to the larger world beyond.\n\nThe roads are new-laid, a smooth expanse of concrete unmarred by time or weather, for there are no potholes to mar the journey here. The houses, mostly low and sprawling, sometimes rise to a second story, but not often. And the mailboxes speak of a collective mind, grouped together at the street's end like the mail slots of an apartment complex, keys granting access to their secrets.\n\nMy house lies on the city's fringe, where suburb meets the wild land beyond. It's a place with space enough for all things, where community pools shimmer behind their gates, kept clean and welcoming. Trails wind through the place for those who wish to walk alone or with a dog at their side, the paths leading nowhere and everywhere. There's no need for a park; the neighborhood's vastness provides.\n\nThe people here are mostly those who have laid down their burdens, the retirees who watch the world with gentle eyes, ensuring the safety of all. Among them are a few who still carry the weight of work, the middle-aged and the young, though they are outnumbered.\n\nThe city near us is large by the count of souls within it but small in its heart. It holds the things one needs, the mall that serves its purpose without excess. It takes a drive to reach the places of commerce, a fifteen-minute journey to the stores that line the streets, offering goods from the organic to the ordinary. A place where all things can be found if one knows where to look.\n\nThis is the neighborhood I call home. A place safe and tended, with its amenities and its ordered ways. A place where the world waits just beyond the horizon, a car ride away, ready to be embraced when needed.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place it was a voice on a podcast. A voice speaking of those who vanished as if swallowed whole by the earth. It was a strange thing to hear about a spot where every flat and lodging fetched thousandfold a month. None had spoken of it before. Not my friends nor the whispers in the streets. Perhaps it's the struggle. I know friends who shed tears into the night, alone in their rooms. The cost of things weighs heavy but we've learned the ways of thrift. The dusty scent of flea market relics and mothballed garments has become familiar. In adulthood, you breathe less deep of the world. Perhaps you take up smoking or perhaps you simply grow used to the state of things. Yet the flea market lingers in your senses. The scent of grown years is dusty pages stacked high on a forgotten piano. It seeps into the leather, defies the wash. In this place, three thrift stores are but a stone's throw. Start at one end and you find charity shops, a library, a rare book haven, and a store of curiosities. Downtown thrums with the pulse of cars and people in the morning but within the thrift's walls, all is silence. A refuge for lost hours. The city swells each year, spilling over with life. They call it a place of growth, headquarters to a sprawling empire of commerce and delivery, still raw with the pangs of its own becoming. It brings to mind New York, where each soul pursues their own course and little is asked of you. Here you can be alone and unseen, free of inquiry. Not as in the South where care is shown in its asking. Here you keep your own counsel as long as you will, the city itself receding like the tide upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound. The pianist next door, the singers above. A community in the guise of strangers. We share in our needs, mark the passage of life and death, lend aid where we can. In this, I'm fortunate. I find kinship with my neighbors and they with me. I clean my space and leave food and they do likewise. We trade letters and greetings. They are a light in the sprawl of this vast and cold city. It is through them I find that perhaps I have not lost my life entirely.",
            "In the heart of the Midwest, a town sits quietly, a whisper away from the sprawling suburbs of the city. It is a place marked by the weight of its own history, where the east side bears the scars of hardship etched into the very bones of the earth. Houses lean with the years, inhabited by those who tread the hard margin of life, their walls a testament to endurance. Yet, the streets speak a softer truth, lined with folk who nod and greet as one passes by, faces that carry stories of their own. Crime casts a shadow, yes, but it is a shadow familiar and not all-consuming. It has touched us lightly, sparing our own though others have not been so fortunate. The neighbors next door know the hollow loss that violence brings, their son taken from them outside a bar, the echo of gunfire a reminder of life's fragility.\n\nThe opioid scourge has laid its heavy hand upon us, fentanyl taking its toll, and the town mourns with a collective sigh. But as with all things, there is resistance. Places of healing dot the town, and the people arm themselves with knowledge and Narcan, standing vigil against the tide. Beneath these struggles lie gems of hope. My son's school stands as a bastion of light, where kindness is not a rarity and all children are given their due, a place where he has found acceptance despite the world’s indifference. The school feeds its young, ensuring no child knows hunger, and the community gathers to bolster one another, to lift as they climb.\n\nThe town's council has turned its gaze to the heart of the town, roads smoothed and parks renewed, though our eastern edge remains rough-hewn and raw, a point of quiet contention among us. Still, there is a fondness here, a quiet satisfaction in the familiarity of these streets, in the unassuming nature of life as it unfolds. Shops, both humble and grand, meet our needs, and though our home may not boast wealth, it holds comfort and memory in its walls. Sixteen years we have called this place ours, and the thought of elsewhere seems a distant dream, for here, amid the struggle and the grace, we have found our home.",
            "The neighborhood sits atop a hill, folding its arms around the stories of old stones and timeworn theaters. I dwell in a seven-story edifice, a sentinel across from the ancient playhouse, while the arcade bar at the foot of The Hill hums with the clamor of diverse souls drawn like moths to the summer’s glow. June and July birth queues that snake along the street, the people lined like pilgrims awaiting entry to some sacred rite. A few blocks up, the city park sprawls, a green lung amid the concrete, its grandeur unexpected in this quarter of the town. Encircling it, the cement holds fast, stairs carved into its flesh like the scars of battles past. Winter’s breath sets the homeless to their labor, erecting tents in regimented rows along the sidewalk, a testament to survival against the merciless rain that hammers down in the heart of the season. They cluster close, defying the chill, clinging to the warmth of the city’s core, the family center their beacon—a place to cleanse the grit from their bodies.\n\nYet it is the people, not the stones, that hold my heart. For Hilltop’s fame was once darkened by the shadow of gang wars, whispers still echoing of federal sweeps that sought to scour the streets clean. The tales endure, passed from father to son, mother to daughter, even to newcomers like myself. The folk labor with fervor, though the world may label their home a den of danger. They cherish their streets, their stories. They warn the pale faces to steer clear when night drapes its cloak, a caution rooted in days gone by, its taste bitter from the draught of prejudice. Perhaps I walk those streets, my skin a shade ambiguous, as one of them, marked not by color but by an understanding of the wounds that linger.\n\nThe Hilltop is an anchor. Its streets pulse with life, and in the dimming day, I find kinship among those who would offer a coat rather than seek to take from me. Here, laundromat doors stretch ajar a moment longer, granting refuge from the relentless rain, a place to breathe and charge the lifeline of a phone. Here, in the shadows, believing myself unseen, a stranger’s kindness alights upon me with a simple gift and the words of worth—reminders that even in a world splintered by ignorance and fear, there are pockets of grace, where humanity shines through the cracks.",
            "I came to this place with the ringing of the eighth grade in my ears, a time when the world seemed as vast as the sky and as distant. Friends were scarce at first, like shadows at dusk, but soon enough I found kinship in a boy from two doors down and another from further along the street. They've long since left, yet their spirits linger in the recesses of memory. The faces peering out from behind curtains remain much the same as when I first arrived. This neighborhood is the likeness of a thousand others, steeped in the cadence of suburbia. Houses rise in two-story uniformity, standing sentry over the quietude. On warm days, the air fills with the laughter of children, a chorus against the stillness of the week. Here, no quarrel has found me, and solitude is respected unless aid is sought. Packages come and go from my porch, untouched by the world's grasping hands, a testament to trust unbroken. Just beyond the reach of my doorstep lies a park, a mere heartbeat away, where memories are etched in sand and sweat. There, the games of youth were played—basketball, football, baseball—all amid the camaraderie of familiar faces. Yet it was there too, beneath the indifferent gaze of the sky, that pain found me in the form of an elbow to the nose. But such is life, where joy eclipses sorrow. Now, the park is a place of nostalgia, its swings and slides the stage for my cousin's children, their laughter a balm to old wounds. The mere thought of it stirs a longing for that which is past. Diversity blooms in this place, a tapestry of flavors within a stone's throw—Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian—all vying for attention. Yet convenience has its price, as the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash draw people away from the heart of it all. Fast food reigns supreme, as ubiquitous as the suburban dream. The stores are plentiful, offering all that one might seek. Dry cleaners stand at the ready, while Walgreens and CVS face off across the street, and the Jewel-Osco stands sentinel, a Midwestern staple. Even among the aisles, diversity whispers its presence, with an Indian-owned store offering a taste of home or a ready-made escape. In sum, this place is a sanctuary in a world of discord. I read of the trials others face with their neighbors and find myself thankful for the peace that envelops me here, a quiet gratitude in a world gone mad.",
            "The college stands but a short walk from the place I lay my head, and for that I am given to a certain fondness for this quarter. The architecture is predominantly of the apartment sort, though there are establishments for eating and drinking that offer a modest diversion. One of these watering holes has taken on a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though the spirits and service are not without their merits. The folk here are, on the whole, agreeable. Young scholars or those of modest means, they find shelter in these affordable walls. Children are a common sight, their presence owed to the nearby school which sits within a stone's throw of my abode. Of my neighbors, I know little and wish for less. Their penchant for the herb has led to the management installing a device of fragrance at their threshold, which my companion and I find a curious sort of jest. The edifices here are aged in their appearance, though perhaps they've been tended to within. Along the way, new apartments have sprouted, though their making is suspect, a mirage of prosperity at a dear cost. A roadside eatery dispenses its fare on paper, warmed by the hum of microwaves, while a gas station stands opposite, whispered to be a place of ill employment. Yet, the city saw fit to mend the road, laying down a broad walk with stretches of green, lending a touch of grace to the surroundings. Trees enshroud my dwelling, their number diminished but still present in greater abundance than farther afield. Beyond my enclave lies another street, less favored by fortune, where the path is broken and the structures weary. Trees abound there too, perhaps to cloak the weathered facades. The specter of crime is not unknown here, the blame shared across the way and beyond. Yet, I find a certain contentment in this place. It suits my purse and offers what I need. The nearness of the university and the convenience of the buses grant me ease in my comings and goings.",
            "The neighborhood lay in a quiet cul-de-sac where the duplexes stood like sentinels, each painted a shade of yellow with white porches and roofs of green metal glinting under the sun. They seemed to be individual houses, scattered without much order, though their common paint betrayed their kinship. Friendships forged in the spaces between them, folks standing at unmarked driveways in the soft folds of evening, speaking low while children tangled with their toys or scratched pictures onto the sidewalks with chalk. It was a refuge from the yawning maw of the modern world, a place caught in amber where time slithered slowly. Fields and trees wrapped the neighborhood in a verdant embrace, under skies vast and blue, clouds like drifting ships.\n\nYet, the tranquility was brittle. The season carried the weight of storms, and last night the sirens wailed their grim warning. We sought shelter, I with my small dog clutched tightly, purse and pillows in hand, as the big dog howled alone in the living room, uneasy in the unnatural calm. The world outside was a drum of hail, the earth steaming where the stones met the hot ground. The temperature plummeted, ninety-two to seventy-five, the hail dissolving upon impact. The skies cleared, and rain fell with the sun's return, painting a double rainbow across the heavens. I fetched my camera, capturing the spectacle to share with those far and wide, though the streets held their silence still, the world encased in the aftermath of storm.\n\nIn time, the quiet broke, folks returning home, the neighborhood breathing life anew. Women called to their children as dinner simmered, and the air was thick with camaraderie. I, newly arrived from New Hampshire to this southern land, found comfort in the lilt of voices, the slow, rolling cadence of the Southern drawl. The home I made in this place mirrored its neighbors, two bedrooms and two baths, though inside, they were not as kin. Some apartments were narrow as a stream, others more generous, an odd puzzle of space.\n\nBeyond my door, the world unfurled. A field spread wide, beckoning with the promise of solitude, a pond lay beyond, still and dark, not for swimming but for contemplation. Deer moved like shadows, and the bullfrog sang his morning song, a basso profondo echoing through the dawn. It was a good place, forty minutes from the city yet a world away, where roosters heralded the break of day and a donkey's bray marked the dusk. I found a haven here, a small community unto itself, a fortunate find amid the vast sprawl of the world.",
            "In the ten years since I came to this place, I reckon I've seen a thing or two worth telling. When I left Riverdale for Stockbridge, it was like stepping into a different world. I remember the tears, the way I cried for the life I left behind, the people I loved. But my folks, they had their reasons. They wanted more for me and my sister, a place where the houses were better, the schools better, a place that was not what folks called ghetto.  \n\nTime passed and the place grew on me. Made friends, made enemies too, as one does in those halls of learning. The neighbors mostly remained distant, shadows in the periphery, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis too, who lived just over the way. They became like kin to me in a manner of speaking, and I held them dear. There was a time when my family and I went to see Mr. Glen tie the knot anew. A wedding it was, a grand affair, full of laughter and dance. I caught the garter but missed the flowers as they sailed through the air. And we danced, oh how we danced, with Marsharii, his daughter, though she's gone her own way now. I hope the world has been kind to her.  \n\nThe neighborhood, it’s a tangle of streets and paths, a maze that I’ve come to know, mostly by the grace of a GPS, exploring when time allows. My friends Kason and Curtis, we’d wander those streets, lost in the joy of video games and the freedom of youth. Some days I’d find solace in the park, the quiet of nature soothing the soul. There, with sticks from the depot, I’d test my balance, wield my wooden sword, a bokken, in simple play.  \n\nA court for basketball, another for tennis, though I haven't picked up a racket in years. My dad, he taught me and my best friend the ways of tennis with Mr. Graves. They pushed us hard, but there was joy in it, a simple pleasure. This place, it holds memories, stories etched in the fabric of time. Yet I feel the best is yet to come, waiting just over the horizon.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a humble town where time seems to linger and the sun casts long shadows over fields of ripening peaches. Johnston they call it, with a sign at the edge of town proclaiming its pride as the Peach Capital of the World. It is a place of quiet industry, where the land whispers tales of toil and harvest, and the people move with the rhythm of seasons. Farmland stretches out like a tapestry woven with peach trees and cattle, the houses set back from the road, two stories tall with roofs of metal or gray shingles to withstand the summer’s relentless blaze.\n\nWithin the town’s core, a solitary stoplight dangles at a crossroads, marking the hub of commerce where the only stores congregate. There’s Hong Kong, a small Chinese eatery run by a family whose roots intertwine with the town’s soil. Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, where the air is thick with the scent of cumin and chili, and Gary's, serving burgers with a side of nostalgia. The pizzeria that once stood has fallen silent, its ovens cold. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a modest pharmacy, is famed not for its medicine but for its sweet elixir of Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, stands as the lone outpost for provisions, though many journey to Batesburg-Leesville’s Walmart for their weekly sustenance.\n\nDollar General is where the town’s pulse quickens, its aisles a refuge for all manner of need. Across the way, a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is tended by a woman who knows all who pass through her door. Her goods are delivered by two faithful movers, known throughout Johnston. Next to her domain, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures, offering a menagerie of services from grooming to boarding.\n\nOn the outskirts, a doctor and a vet tend to the bodies and beasts of Johnston, their practice small but sufficient. The children learn their letters at Johnston Elementary, moving on to distant halls for the schooling of their teenage years. Parks are absent, yet the town dreams of a 2.5-acre haven for families to wander and play, a beacon to draw new souls to its fold.\n\nIn truth, Johnston offers little in the way of diversion. No screens flicker in darkened theaters, no pins tumble in alleys of polished wood. Yet it is a place of quiet charm, a town so slight you might pass it by without a second glance, though its memory lingers like the sweet scent of peaches on a summer breeze.",
            "In the small southern town where I make my home, there is a street threading like a quiet stream between two state highways. A place of passage, yes, with a fretful tally of traffic more than the heart might ask for. Yet beyond that, it's a neighborhood of stillness, where folks have settled into their lives as a hand fits a glove. The faces here have grown familiar, etched into the days like the slow erosion of stone, and each morning is greeted by the customary hum of chores as if the world itself were wound to that rhythm. In the colder months, there is the hill on the side street where children gather, their laughter the only sound against the hush of winter’s breath. Our house sits sentinel at the corner, eyes watching the comings and goings, always knowing the shape and color of the cars that pass. We note those which are strange to us, those that do not belong, as one marks the passage of a cloud.\n\nThe neighbors, they walk their dogs or themselves, and children ride their bikes, weaving through the tapestry of the street. Ours is a home tethered to the land, for we work from it, my wife and I, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen, each day finding us in and out, part of the neighborhood’s pulse. Sometimes, in defiance of the rain, we step outside to play beneath the heavy, gray sky. The grill on the back deck sends its scent upon the air, the smoke of meat and char an offering to the quiet gods of the street. There is the constant whirr of lawnmowers, a hymn of the grass, from March until October’s end when the earth grows weary of its growing. Trees stand as sentinels, remnants of the wood that once was, offering shade and in the fall, a cascade of leaves to be raked and burned, their smoke a harbinger of the season’s turning. Our winters have grown soft, more akin to a protracted autumn, and the front door remains mostly unused, the garage at the back our favored portal.\n\nDays of celebration are hushed affairs. Thanksgiving brings a scattering of unfamiliar cars, kin from distant places come to visit, their presence like a brief flicker of light. It is much the same for Christmas and Mother’s Day. In the quietude of this place, I find a contentment that is near to perfect. If only the road did not draw so many travelers, it might be a haven unmarred.",
            "In the heart of the high desert where the earth lies bare and endless, a land of dirt and dust and more dirt still, my neighborhood sits unassumingly. To live here is to know the unyielding presence of brown, a relentless hue that swallows the horizon. A patch of green here is an extravagance, a testament to the fortune spent on coaxing life from this arid soil. In the nineties, this place stretched wide and sparse, the houses scattered like seeds flung by some careless hand. Now, the city creeps closer, a slow encroachment of concrete and glass, a march toward some inevitable urban sprawl. Yet the soul of the desert remains, unbroken and vast. \n\nThe folks here, mostly, are kind as desert folk tend to be, though like any city, it has its shadows. I live among the old ones, their faces worn by sun and time, and it is a comforting place. The shops are those you'd expect, chains familiar to any traveler, but for finer things, one must venture beyond. Whole Foods and its ilk are strangers here, the city not yet ripe for such indulgence. Construction is the blood of this place, the promise of growth in the wide-open spaces. It is a thought that sits uneasy with me, for I left the rush of city life and have no desire to return to it. My work is in this field, shaping homes from drywall and T-bar, a craft that ties me to the earth here.\n\nWhat I cherish, though, are the creatures that call this land home. The desert, in its stark beauty, harbors life that thrives against the odds. In knowing these non-human neighbors, we find a way to live in harmony. My children, wild with curiosity, chase lizards and desert bugs, their laughter echoing in the dry air as they hunt their tiny prizes. \n\nThere are wonders here for those who seek them. Victorville offers a taste of desert life, a different kind of beauty that takes hold slowly. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is a gathering of joy and tradition, a celebration of this place we call home. Nearby, the mountains of Wrightwood rise, their snowy peaks a contrast to the desert below, offering lessons in winter's sports. And for those drawn to the stories of old, the Victor Valley Museum stands, a keeper of tales told in stone and bone, in the artifacts of those who walked this land before us.\n\nIn this desert, the days stretch long and the nights whisper with the voices of the past. It is a place where time slips by like sand through fingers, where one can find both solitude and kinship. And in the quiet moments, when the wind stirs the dust and the sun sinks low, I am reminded of the simple truth: this land, for all its harshness, is home.",
            "In the place I call my own, where the paths wind through halls of learning and the sun spills its light on the old stones of the campus, there lies a neighborhood not bound by picket fences or streetlamps but by the souls who wander its spaces. This place where I dwell is a college, its sprawling grounds a patchwork of lives intertwined. Here, the dormitory walls cradle those I call my own. We, the dwellers of this academic realm, are a peculiar kind of kin. \n\nThe houses of this place are not houses in the usual sense. There are the tall dormitories rising like sentinels in the dusk, rooms stacked high where two to a room live and dream and learn. In their shadow lie apartments, smaller and more private, where the elder students find refuge. Two floors they rise, and within each, the buzz of twenty souls at least. Beyond these, scattered like leaves in the wind, are houses for those who belong to the school in other ways. Alumni mostly, and they are few, for their kind is less common here.\n\nThe heart of this neighborhood beats with a diversity unmatched. People of all creeds and colors, those who have come from afar and those born close, all find their place. The staff, keepers of knowledge, dwell in the houses, while the new students fill the dorms and the seasoned ones take the apartments.\n\nShops and stores, they line the paths, catering to every need, each a world within walls. A park lies at the edge, a sanctuary for the weary and the wanderers. It is a ground kept clean by those who tread it, a haven from the pressures of the world. This is my neighborhood, a tapestry of lives woven together, where every soul finds its place in the grand design.",
            "There are no sidewalks in the place where I live. The world slopes away from my door and the house sits perched on the crest of a hill that folks call the workout hill for the joggers who labor up its incline each day. Without a path to guide them, they walk the blacktop road, pitted and worn, hazardous in its way. The wires that snake around the block hang in tatters, victims of the storms that rage through, laying waste to trees and lines, the repairs a patchwork testament to the fury of the elements. Tall evergreens stand sentinel, but they're not welcome here. They fall beneath the axe, for they block the view of the ocean, the houses built high, glass-fronted and looming, each a witness to the bay's beauty. Come sunset, the waters catch fire beneath the sky's orange glow, though more often clouds shroud the sun, leaving the light to filter through a haze. The days are overcast and damp, moss creeping over all it touches, roofs and cars and railings turned green in its embrace. I left my car out for a month, and it was swallowed by the moss, three hours of scraping to reclaim it. Children are few, though a school lies near, the neighborhood mostly the domain of the old, retirees who have traded children for dogs. They roam the lawns and race the streets, slipping through open doors to claim the warmth of a stranger's home. I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it back into the world it knew. Rabbits run wild here, bold and burrowing, the gardeners' bane, yet beloved by my cats who have hunted them to near extinction. Birds flit and flutter, sparrows and hummingbirds, while hawks and eagles are driven off by the crows, protectors of this place. There are no stores to speak of, but the hike downhill leads to the waterfront where restaurants serve the sea's bounty. No beach lies there, only rocks to hurl into the bay, the opposite shore visible through the mist that clings to the days.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies the neighborhood of Bensonhurst, a place where the city hum persists, and the pulse of New York City is ever felt. To find this enclave is no chore, for the veins of public transit reach all through it, making the journey seamless and swift. The streets bear witness to the tides of change, for in the past decades, an influx of Asian souls has woven a new tapestry upon this urban fabric. As you wander, the signs of their presence are unmistakable, each block adorned with Asian-owned stores—their neon signs casting a glow in the evening haze, supermarkets and laundromats thriving where once were others. Here, the food is fresh, the prices fair, and the convenience a balm for the hurried heart of the city dweller. Four such markets stand within mere steps of one another, a testament to the world's smallness.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not solely the domain of one people. It is a mosaic, a patchwork of lives and stories, immigrants and their progeny, each contributing to the hum of life that fills the air. The echoes of their voices and the rhythm of their lives are woven into the very fabric of this place.\n\nNearby, a park stands renewed, a sanctuary of sorts amidst the city sprawl. There, courts for basketball and handball, fields for soccer and baseball, await those in search of play. Children’s laughter rings out from the playground, and in summer, water fountains offer their cooling embrace. Here too, the diversity of the city is reflected in the faces of those who gather, united in the spirit of sport and leisure.\n\nThe skyline of Bensonhurst is not punctuated by the towers of commerce, but by the more humble abodes of co-ops and condominiums, where families find their homes. The streets are lined with the low houses of two families, and the air is filled with the sound of life. Cars pass by, their music a rolling soundtrack, and engines roar to greet the dawn.\n\nWhen night falls, a cloak of caution is advised. Though the streets are mostly safe, the shadows can conceal those who mean harm. Memories linger of past encounters, specters of bullies and thieves who once roamed these streets. Packages, left unguarded, are known to vanish, spirited away by unseen hands. And then, there is the matter of the dogs, whose owners heed not the city's edicts. The pavements bear witness to their neglect, and each step must be taken with care, lest one's shoes bear the mark of their oversight.\n\nSo, tread carefully and keep your eyes open, for Bensonhurst is a place where the past and present converge, where the city's heartbeat is strong, and the stories of its people are written anew each day.",
            "In the city of Portland, Oregon, there is a saying painted on the back of a building that hosts a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, and perhaps more than it should by law. Keep Portland Weird, it reads. And what is this weirdness they speak of? For some, it is a whisper from a time when the city was not so well known, nor so expensive, when the streets bred a different kind of life, creative and wild. A time before the influx of those from the south, before the skyscrapers of concrete and glass rose to greet the clouds. For others, it is a call to arms, an invitation to a city where the odd is embraced, where peculiar is but a shade of charm.\n\nDespite the coming of the new, the affluent, the ever-rising walls of condominiums, Portland clings to this strangeness. It does not mean all is welcome, but it does mean there is room for what elsewhere might be pushed away. This city does not turn from the modern world, nor the battles it brings. Portland buys its goods from distant lands just as the rest, and in its heart are a million ways to be strange, to walk a path not marked by the footsteps of others. Yet among this, there is normalcy. There is yoga and the hipsters and those who wear ties and carry briefcases. Perhaps to be weird here is to wear these things with less weight, to let them slide from your shoulders.\n\nIn the neighborhood where I find myself, the houses are painted in colors that seem plucked from a dream. The gardens are full of life, flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets as if they might spill over and cover the world. In the summer, one might find a free box sitting on a corner, a simple container with gifts inside, discarded by one and waiting for another. It might be cardboard or plastic, but inside is the magic of the unexpected, a treasure waiting for the right eyes to see it. Clothes, books, anything at all might lie within.\n\nThis is the heart of Portland for me, and I am but one among the myriad. There are those who would never dream of taking what they wear from a box on the street. They might find their joy in yoga with goats or in cheering for the Timbers, the city's proud soccer team. Portland is a place where hearts beat for a thousand different things. A place where dreams are chased or left to linger in the dim light of a bar.\n\nThere is darkness here too. A problem with drugs that is perhaps a shadow of the mind's own struggles. The rain falls heavy and long, the clouds like a shroud, and they say it weighs upon the soul. There are those without homes, drawn by the promise of help that is better than most but not enough. And those who have homes are torn between compassion and disdain. In this, perhaps, there is nothing strange at all.",
            "The mountains stood steadfast in the north, sentinels of the sun’s passage, day after day, night after night. They watched with an ancient patience, unyielding as the earth itself. In the clamor of daily life, in the grind of tasks and trials, they were there, silent and solemn. And when those days came, when the world seemed a weight unbearable, they compelled my gaze. They let me lay my weary spirit upon their shoulders, lending strength to carry just one more day. I came to this place when my journey of learning began, drawn by the northern peaks that loomed over the campus. The university had its own beauty, in the form of grand facades and tranquil ponds, trees that whispered secrets to the wind. Yet it was the mountains that held dominion over my heart. The town sprawled out, beautiful in its own right, with cafés that cradled the hours of caffeine-fueled toil. A brief walk or a bus ride brought one to the heart of downtown, where the bricks, faded and weary, whispered tales of a time gone by. Here, this suburban town took on the guise of an urban sprawl, bustling with life, yet the clamor faded quickly as one passed the library, retreating once more into the quietude of small-town life. This juxtaposition of worlds, so close and yet so distinct, gave the city a wonder that called out to be known. Memories were born here, each tied to a place—a stroll past rusted swings after a night without sleep, a mad dash through the bustling streets to a theater where the university gifted glimpses of art. And yet, as all places are, it was a canvas for life’s harsher strokes. The ponds, those mirrors to the sky, served both as places of contemplation and as refuges for tears shed in the depths of night’s despair. I knew those nights well. Watching the turtles and ducks, the dance of insects upon the water, I pondered my place in this great tapestry, my purpose amid the endless enigma of existence. And so I walked, past the ponds, past the parks, past the quiet cries of suburban homes, until I found myself upon a main street. The sun, in its ascent, cast its light upon the palms, painting the heavens with hues of dawn. I looked up then, and saw I was moving north. There they were, as they had always been, the mountains touching the sky with their towering grace. And as if speaking in silence, they stirred within me a resolve to endure.",
            "You might pass it by without a second thought, for it lies behind the faded facades of commerce, where few would think to find a place called home. But there it is, behind the derelict Whole Foods, past the transient hotels that only stir with life in the warmth of summer reunions. Here, a hidden township hums with its own life. Streets lined with apartments, each complex nestled like Russian dolls, meticulously disassembled and aligned down the crooked lane. The first cluster is known for its tales of misdeeds, whispered about on late-night news, yet we shall not linger there. For beyond lies another realm unknown to most who tread the mundane paths of this land.\n\nAcross the way stands the satellite campus of a modest college, its silent buildings standing guard. Students trickle in with the early light, coffee in hand, eyes heavy with the weight of morning. Iron gates creak and groan, admitting them one by one, while the impatient chorus of commuters rises—a symphony of honking horns and muttered curses at delayed passage. The road leads to another, where a park and a center for mending broken bodies coexist. The center, with its cheerful veranda, watches the world turn, a lazy fan stirring the thick air of summer. Children tumble across the green, their joy a sharp contrast to the bees that drift lazily among the wildflowers.\n\nOld souls shuffle along the path with their canine companions, casting disapproving glances at the youth on their wheeled boards, yet offering nods to the girls who gather, whispering of love and fleeting fame. Nearby, a strip mall stands—a sushi joint with its modest fare, a pool supply store, and a nail salon sandwiched between. Here, one could prepare for summer, indulge in a manicure, and savor hibachi all in a single breath. A frozen yogurt shop sits within, where the young often seek reprieve from the sun, clutching dripping cups as they skate and puff on their devices, convinced of their own coolness.\n\nThis neighborhood is but a slice of the old America, a relic in the languid south where time moves as slow as the syrupy air, and change is a stranger seldom seen.",
            "In the neighborhood where I live, the old houses hunker down like weathered sentinels of another time. Most stand alone, single-family dwellings, but here and there a house has been split, conjoined like some forlorn conjoined twin. My home sits with its small yard out front and a narrow driveway to the side, and it whispers of a past when this suburbia was the heart of an American dream that now drifts like smoke, elusive and distant. Yet the streets still echo with the remnants of that dream, holding on with a quiet resilience, beckoning those who pass through to remember. The people here, their optimism faded like the paint on their weather-beaten homes, tend the little yards with a lesser care, and yet the driveways still cradle a car or two. Children play in the streets, their laughter bright against the backdrop of a world that feels like all there is.\n\nThe schoolhouse, standing sentinel for near ninety years, seems to spin futures from the dust of nostalgia, binding the youth to a history the elders recall with a fond ache. Churches dot the landscape like forgotten relics, their pews empty, while the basketball courts pulse with life. Each house wears a different face, yet the spirit within feels kindred. A supermarket, Super “A,” is run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the lone Arab souls among the largely African American residents who weave the tapestry of this place. Wide streets stretch out, where kids dash after footballs, pausing only as cars inch past, a dance of youth and steel.\n\nGenerations have sunk roots here, and each resident seems to carry stories of a time when everyone knew everyone else. There was a karate school once, but with the passing of the karate kid dreams, it gave way to a pharmacy, where remedies of another kind are dispensed. A little movie theater, offering old films at a price that spares few, is a sanctuary for the elders who relish a night away from the youthful clamor. An expressway cuts through, though its exits and entrances lie just beyond our reach, a contested line where the elders’ wisdom ruled over the young’s desire for connection.\n\nA new high school rises, and in its shadow, we ponder what symbol might capture the spirit of this town. I think a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin might just fit the mold of this place, a fusion of past and future, as absurd as it is fitting.",
            "In the vast sprawl of the city where I make my home, the streets wind through a mosaic of life and commerce. Here, the neighborhoods unfurl like patches on an old quilt, stitched together by the invisible hands of time and circumstance. The shops and eateries, places of human gathering and solitude alike, stand scattered among the dwellings as if cast there by the whims of some ancient god. You find the grand facades of corporate empires shoulder to shoulder with humble boutiques, their windows a testament to the timeless dance of ambition and dream. The streets are alive with the tread of those seeking the new, the novel, and the familiar comforts of the old. Yet alongside these bustling avenues, quiet parks lay nestled—a refuge for the laughter of children and the soft murmur of leaves.\n\nIn this tapestry of urban life, the people are as varied as the stars in a cold, clear night. A place where the colors of the world blend and stand apart, a testament to humanity's ceaseless migration and settlement. Here lives a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, there the solemn presence of Orthodox Jewry, and the echoes of the old Soviet lands in the voices of newcomers. Beyond the borders of my own corner of the city, the world expands with neighborhoods named for far places, Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—each a world within a world, where the old ways are not forgotten, nor entirely remembered.\n\nBut to traverse these distances, even the briefest of miles, is to wrestle with the ceaseless tide of traffic. The city's arteries clogged with metal and rubber, each movement a test of patience. Few take to the streets on foot, for the city is a vast, sprawling beast, and her distances are not for the faint of heart. Yet the city grows, relentless as the tide, new buildings rising from its depths, promising sanctuary and promise, but to many, only the specter of more and more and more.\n\nAnd so, the city harbors its multitude of abodes, from the grand towers reaching skyward to the low, humble homes nestled in their shadows. There are those who seek the solitude of their own plot of earth, others content with the company of neighbors above and below. Each street, each house, a story. My own neighborhood, a crossroads of ages and stories, where each face is a mystery, each life a narrative unwritten to my eyes. It is not the place of my childhood, where the streets rang with the shouts of play and the bonds of those young and untested by time. But the echoes remain, a soft whisper in the heart of a city that never truly sleeps.",
            "Where is everything she asked. Her eyes wide as we drove past the cornfields stretching out to meet the sky. This is it I said. The sparseness of the land a shock to her senses. She lived in a place where the grocery store was a five-minute walk from her door and the sky was crowded with rooftops. Never seen such space this side of anywhere. I told her of the life in rural Ohio. How it was to rise and sleep under this open sky. And she came to know me then. The road a ribbon of gravel beneath us. Leading past a quarry filled with water like an old wound. The development where I lived just beyond. The houses standing in their brick and stucco silence. Each with half an acre or more to its name. Tended with a pride as old as the land itself. In the springtime the flowers rise like a promise kept. The midwestern trees shedding their leaves in a slow dance through the seasons. The driveways filled with cars polished to a shine. Mercedes Benz gleaming under the sun’s eye. Onward we drove toward my home. Grey stucco against the wide sky. My Korean neighbor always out with a smile. Mowing the grass or singing over the mower's hum. His laughter a part of the air we breathed. Once a doctor they say. Now blending with the grass and his John Deere. Age taking its toll but not his spirit. And there my home. Geese in the side yard scattered by the Terrier's chase. A stream out back feeding into the quarry. Bullfrogs croaking low and deep. The stream murmuring its secrets. The moo of distant cattle carried on the wind. Across a bridge of wood handmade and worn lies an oasis untouched. Trees and herbs and wildflowers growing as they will. This was my childhood's haunt. A place of forts and wild hunts of chasing nothing but shadows and dreams. Winters came hard and sharp. The land stripped bare but for its beauty. Branches skeletal against the sky. Snowfall turning the world to white overnight. Angels of snow lining the yard. My sister's handiwork. Snowmen standing guard in their silence. We fought my sister and I. Snowballs our chosen arms. Forts built of snow and branches our bastions. In this world nothing else mattered. We were children then. Untethered and free."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies a place carved out by the hand of time, a small town in Michigan where the land stretches from fields of toil to the quiet hum of tourist havens. A place far removed from the sprawling embrace of city malls, where no Wal-mart or Target casts its fluorescent glow, and the name Applebee’s is but a whisper carried on the wind. To reach any destination requires the journey of wheels, yet in this pocket of the world, beauty unfurls in a tapestry of water and sky. Here, the city is cradled by the arms of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other, each offering the solace of shores where the weary can rest their feet in the cool embrace of sand.\n\nThe neighborhood echoes the song of small town life, where houses stand apart like solitary guardians, each with its own tale to tell. They are not the mirrored dreams of suburban sprawl, but homes of age and character, some bearing the marks of renewal, others holding fast to their roots. Basements lie beneath them, seen from the road, while aluminum siding speaks of years gone by. The spectrum of homes is a kaleidoscope of hues, each standing in testament to the spirit of Middle America, where labor is the currency of life, and families weave their stories in the fabric of days.\n\nChildren roam the streets with laughter in their wake, while dogs lead their masters on journeys of discovery. The rhythm of wheels on pavement sings of bikes and rollerblades tracing the paths between neighbors. Here, faces are familiar, and the bond of community is a gentle thing. A wave to the one grilling in the yard or a smile to the lone wanderer with their dog is the language of belonging. Lawns are tended with the care of stewards, leaves banished to the memory of autumn. Grass is kept in check, and gardens flourish in their quiet rebellion against the march of time.\n\nThis is not the kind of place that dazzles the eye with grandeur, but rather one that whispers of home in the language of peace and safety. It is a place where the soul finds its haven at day’s end. Nearby, the county sheriff’s department stands watch, and the health department offers its hand. The city’s recycling center hums with purpose, serving all who seek its aid. Baseball fields echo with the calls of announcers, names of players carried on the breeze. The small town airport lies beyond, a place where the sky is alive with the rumble of engines, marking the passage of time in the rhythm of flight.\n\nIce cream awaits the wanderer’s step, a sweet reward for the journey downtown. Parks lie within reach, a mere eight blocks from home, where children can ride their bikes and dreams take flight. This is a place where the heart finds its rest, where life moves at the pace of a gentle walk, and the world is a tapestry of the ordinary made extraordinary.",
            "The place where I make my home is like an endless sea of sameness, a sprawling suburbia carved from the earth in neat rows and parcels, each a mirror reflection of the next. A place where the hand of the homeowner's association has pressed firm upon the land. As you enter, it's a tableau of single-story houses, each kept with a precision that might seem unnatural were it not the edict of the association. The lawns are small and manicured, the grass trimmed and bordered by stones, the driveways short. There are trees, but they stand like sentinels, spaced deliberately and at intervals decided by those who rule this place. Every home has its double garage, a place for the vehicles that ferry their owners to the larger world beyond.\n\nThe roads are new-laid, a smooth expanse of concrete unmarred by time or weather, for there are no potholes to mar the journey here. The houses, mostly low and sprawling, sometimes rise to a second story, but not often. And the mailboxes speak of a collective mind, grouped together at the street's end like the mail slots of an apartment complex, keys granting access to their secrets.\n\nMy house lies on the city's fringe, where suburb meets the wild land beyond. It's a place with space enough for all things, where community pools shimmer behind their gates, kept clean and welcoming. Trails wind through the place for those who wish to walk alone or with a dog at their side, the paths leading nowhere and everywhere. There's no need for a park; the neighborhood's vastness provides.\n\nThe people here are mostly those who have laid down their burdens, the retirees who watch the world with gentle eyes, ensuring the safety of all. Among them are a few who still carry the weight of work, the middle-aged and the young, though they are outnumbered.\n\nThe city near us is large by the count of souls within it but small in its heart. It holds the things one needs, the mall that serves its purpose without excess. It takes a drive to reach the places of commerce, a fifteen-minute journey to the stores that line the streets, offering goods from the organic to the ordinary. A place where all things can be found if one knows where to look.\n\nThis is the neighborhood I call home. A place safe and tended, with its amenities and its ordered ways. A place where the world waits just beyond the horizon, a car ride away, ready to be embraced when needed.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place it was a voice on a podcast. A voice speaking of those who vanished as if swallowed whole by the earth. It was a strange thing to hear about a spot where every flat and lodging fetched thousandfold a month. None had spoken of it before. Not my friends nor the whispers in the streets. Perhaps it's the struggle. I know friends who shed tears into the night, alone in their rooms. The cost of things weighs heavy but we've learned the ways of thrift. The dusty scent of flea market relics and mothballed garments has become familiar. In adulthood, you breathe less deep of the world. Perhaps you take up smoking or perhaps you simply grow used to the state of things. Yet the flea market lingers in your senses. The scent of grown years is dusty pages stacked high on a forgotten piano. It seeps into the leather, defies the wash. In this place, three thrift stores are but a stone's throw. Start at one end and you find charity shops, a library, a rare book haven, and a store of curiosities. Downtown thrums with the pulse of cars and people in the morning but within the thrift's walls, all is silence. A refuge for lost hours. The city swells each year, spilling over with life. They call it a place of growth, headquarters to a sprawling empire of commerce and delivery, still raw with the pangs of its own becoming. It brings to mind New York, where each soul pursues their own course and little is asked of you. Here you can be alone and unseen, free of inquiry. Not as in the South where care is shown in its asking. Here you keep your own counsel as long as you will, the city itself receding like the tide upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound. The pianist next door, the singers above. A community in the guise of strangers. We share in our needs, mark the passage of life and death, lend aid where we can. In this, I'm fortunate. I find kinship with my neighbors and they with me. I clean my space and leave food and they do likewise. We trade letters and greetings. They are a light in the sprawl of this vast and cold city. It is through them I find that perhaps I have not lost my life entirely.",
            "In the heart of the Midwest, a town sits quietly, a whisper away from the sprawling suburbs of the city. It is a place marked by the weight of its own history, where the east side bears the scars of hardship etched into the very bones of the earth. Houses lean with the years, inhabited by those who tread the hard margin of life, their walls a testament to endurance. Yet, the streets speak a softer truth, lined with folk who nod and greet as one passes by, faces that carry stories of their own. Crime casts a shadow, yes, but it is a shadow familiar and not all-consuming. It has touched us lightly, sparing our own though others have not been so fortunate. The neighbors next door know the hollow loss that violence brings, their son taken from them outside a bar, the echo of gunfire a reminder of life's fragility.\n\nThe opioid scourge has laid its heavy hand upon us, fentanyl taking its toll, and the town mourns with a collective sigh. But as with all things, there is resistance. Places of healing dot the town, and the people arm themselves with knowledge and Narcan, standing vigil against the tide. Beneath these struggles lie gems of hope. My son's school stands as a bastion of light, where kindness is not a rarity and all children are given their due, a place where he has found acceptance despite the world’s indifference. The school feeds its young, ensuring no child knows hunger, and the community gathers to bolster one another, to lift as they climb.\n\nThe town's council has turned its gaze to the heart of the town, roads smoothed and parks renewed, though our eastern edge remains rough-hewn and raw, a point of quiet contention among us. Still, there is a fondness here, a quiet satisfaction in the familiarity of these streets, in the unassuming nature of life as it unfolds. Shops, both humble and grand, meet our needs, and though our home may not boast wealth, it holds comfort and memory in its walls. Sixteen years we have called this place ours, and the thought of elsewhere seems a distant dream, for here, amid the struggle and the grace, we have found our home.",
            "The neighborhood sits atop a hill, folding its arms around the stories of old stones and timeworn theaters. I dwell in a seven-story edifice, a sentinel across from the ancient playhouse, while the arcade bar at the foot of The Hill hums with the clamor of diverse souls drawn like moths to the summer’s glow. June and July birth queues that snake along the street, the people lined like pilgrims awaiting entry to some sacred rite. A few blocks up, the city park sprawls, a green lung amid the concrete, its grandeur unexpected in this quarter of the town. Encircling it, the cement holds fast, stairs carved into its flesh like the scars of battles past. Winter’s breath sets the homeless to their labor, erecting tents in regimented rows along the sidewalk, a testament to survival against the merciless rain that hammers down in the heart of the season. They cluster close, defying the chill, clinging to the warmth of the city’s core, the family center their beacon—a place to cleanse the grit from their bodies.\n\nYet it is the people, not the stones, that hold my heart. For Hilltop’s fame was once darkened by the shadow of gang wars, whispers still echoing of federal sweeps that sought to scour the streets clean. The tales endure, passed from father to son, mother to daughter, even to newcomers like myself. The folk labor with fervor, though the world may label their home a den of danger. They cherish their streets, their stories. They warn the pale faces to steer clear when night drapes its cloak, a caution rooted in days gone by, its taste bitter from the draught of prejudice. Perhaps I walk those streets, my skin a shade ambiguous, as one of them, marked not by color but by an understanding of the wounds that linger.\n\nThe Hilltop is an anchor. Its streets pulse with life, and in the dimming day, I find kinship among those who would offer a coat rather than seek to take from me. Here, laundromat doors stretch ajar a moment longer, granting refuge from the relentless rain, a place to breathe and charge the lifeline of a phone. Here, in the shadows, believing myself unseen, a stranger’s kindness alights upon me with a simple gift and the words of worth—reminders that even in a world splintered by ignorance and fear, there are pockets of grace, where humanity shines through the cracks.",
            "I came to this place with the ringing of the eighth grade in my ears, a time when the world seemed as vast as the sky and as distant. Friends were scarce at first, like shadows at dusk, but soon enough I found kinship in a boy from two doors down and another from further along the street. They've long since left, yet their spirits linger in the recesses of memory. The faces peering out from behind curtains remain much the same as when I first arrived. This neighborhood is the likeness of a thousand others, steeped in the cadence of suburbia. Houses rise in two-story uniformity, standing sentry over the quietude. On warm days, the air fills with the laughter of children, a chorus against the stillness of the week. Here, no quarrel has found me, and solitude is respected unless aid is sought. Packages come and go from my porch, untouched by the world's grasping hands, a testament to trust unbroken. Just beyond the reach of my doorstep lies a park, a mere heartbeat away, where memories are etched in sand and sweat. There, the games of youth were played—basketball, football, baseball—all amid the camaraderie of familiar faces. Yet it was there too, beneath the indifferent gaze of the sky, that pain found me in the form of an elbow to the nose. But such is life, where joy eclipses sorrow. Now, the park is a place of nostalgia, its swings and slides the stage for my cousin's children, their laughter a balm to old wounds. The mere thought of it stirs a longing for that which is past. Diversity blooms in this place, a tapestry of flavors within a stone's throw—Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian—all vying for attention. Yet convenience has its price, as the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash draw people away from the heart of it all. Fast food reigns supreme, as ubiquitous as the suburban dream. The stores are plentiful, offering all that one might seek. Dry cleaners stand at the ready, while Walgreens and CVS face off across the street, and the Jewel-Osco stands sentinel, a Midwestern staple. Even among the aisles, diversity whispers its presence, with an Indian-owned store offering a taste of home or a ready-made escape. In sum, this place is a sanctuary in a world of discord. I read of the trials others face with their neighbors and find myself thankful for the peace that envelops me here, a quiet gratitude in a world gone mad.",
            "The college stands but a short walk from the place I lay my head, and for that I am given to a certain fondness for this quarter. The architecture is predominantly of the apartment sort, though there are establishments for eating and drinking that offer a modest diversion. One of these watering holes has taken on a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though the spirits and service are not without their merits. The folk here are, on the whole, agreeable. Young scholars or those of modest means, they find shelter in these affordable walls. Children are a common sight, their presence owed to the nearby school which sits within a stone's throw of my abode. Of my neighbors, I know little and wish for less. Their penchant for the herb has led to the management installing a device of fragrance at their threshold, which my companion and I find a curious sort of jest. The edifices here are aged in their appearance, though perhaps they've been tended to within. Along the way, new apartments have sprouted, though their making is suspect, a mirage of prosperity at a dear cost. A roadside eatery dispenses its fare on paper, warmed by the hum of microwaves, while a gas station stands opposite, whispered to be a place of ill employment. Yet, the city saw fit to mend the road, laying down a broad walk with stretches of green, lending a touch of grace to the surroundings. Trees enshroud my dwelling, their number diminished but still present in greater abundance than farther afield. Beyond my enclave lies another street, less favored by fortune, where the path is broken and the structures weary. Trees abound there too, perhaps to cloak the weathered facades. The specter of crime is not unknown here, the blame shared across the way and beyond. Yet, I find a certain contentment in this place. It suits my purse and offers what I need. The nearness of the university and the convenience of the buses grant me ease in my comings and goings.",
            "The neighborhood lay in a quiet cul-de-sac where the duplexes stood like sentinels, each painted a shade of yellow with white porches and roofs of green metal glinting under the sun. They seemed to be individual houses, scattered without much order, though their common paint betrayed their kinship. Friendships forged in the spaces between them, folks standing at unmarked driveways in the soft folds of evening, speaking low while children tangled with their toys or scratched pictures onto the sidewalks with chalk. It was a refuge from the yawning maw of the modern world, a place caught in amber where time slithered slowly. Fields and trees wrapped the neighborhood in a verdant embrace, under skies vast and blue, clouds like drifting ships.\n\nYet, the tranquility was brittle. The season carried the weight of storms, and last night the sirens wailed their grim warning. We sought shelter, I with my small dog clutched tightly, purse and pillows in hand, as the big dog howled alone in the living room, uneasy in the unnatural calm. The world outside was a drum of hail, the earth steaming where the stones met the hot ground. The temperature plummeted, ninety-two to seventy-five, the hail dissolving upon impact. The skies cleared, and rain fell with the sun's return, painting a double rainbow across the heavens. I fetched my camera, capturing the spectacle to share with those far and wide, though the streets held their silence still, the world encased in the aftermath of storm.\n\nIn time, the quiet broke, folks returning home, the neighborhood breathing life anew. Women called to their children as dinner simmered, and the air was thick with camaraderie. I, newly arrived from New Hampshire to this southern land, found comfort in the lilt of voices, the slow, rolling cadence of the Southern drawl. The home I made in this place mirrored its neighbors, two bedrooms and two baths, though inside, they were not as kin. Some apartments were narrow as a stream, others more generous, an odd puzzle of space.\n\nBeyond my door, the world unfurled. A field spread wide, beckoning with the promise of solitude, a pond lay beyond, still and dark, not for swimming but for contemplation. Deer moved like shadows, and the bullfrog sang his morning song, a basso profondo echoing through the dawn. It was a good place, forty minutes from the city yet a world away, where roosters heralded the break of day and a donkey's bray marked the dusk. I found a haven here, a small community unto itself, a fortunate find amid the vast sprawl of the world.",
            "In the ten years since I came to this place, I reckon I've seen a thing or two worth telling. When I left Riverdale for Stockbridge, it was like stepping into a different world. I remember the tears, the way I cried for the life I left behind, the people I loved. But my folks, they had their reasons. They wanted more for me and my sister, a place where the houses were better, the schools better, a place that was not what folks called ghetto.  \n\nTime passed and the place grew on me. Made friends, made enemies too, as one does in those halls of learning. The neighbors mostly remained distant, shadows in the periphery, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis too, who lived just over the way. They became like kin to me in a manner of speaking, and I held them dear. There was a time when my family and I went to see Mr. Glen tie the knot anew. A wedding it was, a grand affair, full of laughter and dance. I caught the garter but missed the flowers as they sailed through the air. And we danced, oh how we danced, with Marsharii, his daughter, though she's gone her own way now. I hope the world has been kind to her.  \n\nThe neighborhood, it’s a tangle of streets and paths, a maze that I’ve come to know, mostly by the grace of a GPS, exploring when time allows. My friends Kason and Curtis, we’d wander those streets, lost in the joy of video games and the freedom of youth. Some days I’d find solace in the park, the quiet of nature soothing the soul. There, with sticks from the depot, I’d test my balance, wield my wooden sword, a bokken, in simple play.  \n\nA court for basketball, another for tennis, though I haven't picked up a racket in years. My dad, he taught me and my best friend the ways of tennis with Mr. Graves. They pushed us hard, but there was joy in it, a simple pleasure. This place, it holds memories, stories etched in the fabric of time. Yet I feel the best is yet to come, waiting just over the horizon.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a humble town where time seems to linger and the sun casts long shadows over fields of ripening peaches. Johnston they call it, with a sign at the edge of town proclaiming its pride as the Peach Capital of the World. It is a place of quiet industry, where the land whispers tales of toil and harvest, and the people move with the rhythm of seasons. Farmland stretches out like a tapestry woven with peach trees and cattle, the houses set back from the road, two stories tall with roofs of metal or gray shingles to withstand the summer’s relentless blaze.\n\nWithin the town’s core, a solitary stoplight dangles at a crossroads, marking the hub of commerce where the only stores congregate. There’s Hong Kong, a small Chinese eatery run by a family whose roots intertwine with the town’s soil. Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, where the air is thick with the scent of cumin and chili, and Gary's, serving burgers with a side of nostalgia. The pizzeria that once stood has fallen silent, its ovens cold. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a modest pharmacy, is famed not for its medicine but for its sweet elixir of Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, stands as the lone outpost for provisions, though many journey to Batesburg-Leesville’s Walmart for their weekly sustenance.\n\nDollar General is where the town’s pulse quickens, its aisles a refuge for all manner of need. Across the way, a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is tended by a woman who knows all who pass through her door. Her goods are delivered by two faithful movers, known throughout Johnston. Next to her domain, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures, offering a menagerie of services from grooming to boarding.\n\nOn the outskirts, a doctor and a vet tend to the bodies and beasts of Johnston, their practice small but sufficient. The children learn their letters at Johnston Elementary, moving on to distant halls for the schooling of their teenage years. Parks are absent, yet the town dreams of a 2.5-acre haven for families to wander and play, a beacon to draw new souls to its fold.\n\nIn truth, Johnston offers little in the way of diversion. No screens flicker in darkened theaters, no pins tumble in alleys of polished wood. Yet it is a place of quiet charm, a town so slight you might pass it by without a second glance, though its memory lingers like the sweet scent of peaches on a summer breeze.",
            "In the small southern town where I make my home, there is a street threading like a quiet stream between two state highways. A place of passage, yes, with a fretful tally of traffic more than the heart might ask for. Yet beyond that, it's a neighborhood of stillness, where folks have settled into their lives as a hand fits a glove. The faces here have grown familiar, etched into the days like the slow erosion of stone, and each morning is greeted by the customary hum of chores as if the world itself were wound to that rhythm. In the colder months, there is the hill on the side street where children gather, their laughter the only sound against the hush of winter’s breath. Our house sits sentinel at the corner, eyes watching the comings and goings, always knowing the shape and color of the cars that pass. We note those which are strange to us, those that do not belong, as one marks the passage of a cloud.\n\nThe neighbors, they walk their dogs or themselves, and children ride their bikes, weaving through the tapestry of the street. Ours is a home tethered to the land, for we work from it, my wife and I, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen, each day finding us in and out, part of the neighborhood’s pulse. Sometimes, in defiance of the rain, we step outside to play beneath the heavy, gray sky. The grill on the back deck sends its scent upon the air, the smoke of meat and char an offering to the quiet gods of the street. There is the constant whirr of lawnmowers, a hymn of the grass, from March until October’s end when the earth grows weary of its growing. Trees stand as sentinels, remnants of the wood that once was, offering shade and in the fall, a cascade of leaves to be raked and burned, their smoke a harbinger of the season’s turning. Our winters have grown soft, more akin to a protracted autumn, and the front door remains mostly unused, the garage at the back our favored portal.\n\nDays of celebration are hushed affairs. Thanksgiving brings a scattering of unfamiliar cars, kin from distant places come to visit, their presence like a brief flicker of light. It is much the same for Christmas and Mother’s Day. In the quietude of this place, I find a contentment that is near to perfect. If only the road did not draw so many travelers, it might be a haven unmarred.",
            "In the heart of the high desert where the earth lies bare and endless, a land of dirt and dust and more dirt still, my neighborhood sits unassumingly. To live here is to know the unyielding presence of brown, a relentless hue that swallows the horizon. A patch of green here is an extravagance, a testament to the fortune spent on coaxing life from this arid soil. In the nineties, this place stretched wide and sparse, the houses scattered like seeds flung by some careless hand. Now, the city creeps closer, a slow encroachment of concrete and glass, a march toward some inevitable urban sprawl. Yet the soul of the desert remains, unbroken and vast. \n\nThe folks here, mostly, are kind as desert folk tend to be, though like any city, it has its shadows. I live among the old ones, their faces worn by sun and time, and it is a comforting place. The shops are those you'd expect, chains familiar to any traveler, but for finer things, one must venture beyond. Whole Foods and its ilk are strangers here, the city not yet ripe for such indulgence. Construction is the blood of this place, the promise of growth in the wide-open spaces. It is a thought that sits uneasy with me, for I left the rush of city life and have no desire to return to it. My work is in this field, shaping homes from drywall and T-bar, a craft that ties me to the earth here.\n\nWhat I cherish, though, are the creatures that call this land home. The desert, in its stark beauty, harbors life that thrives against the odds. In knowing these non-human neighbors, we find a way to live in harmony. My children, wild with curiosity, chase lizards and desert bugs, their laughter echoing in the dry air as they hunt their tiny prizes. \n\nThere are wonders here for those who seek them. Victorville offers a taste of desert life, a different kind of beauty that takes hold slowly. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is a gathering of joy and tradition, a celebration of this place we call home. Nearby, the mountains of Wrightwood rise, their snowy peaks a contrast to the desert below, offering lessons in winter's sports. And for those drawn to the stories of old, the Victor Valley Museum stands, a keeper of tales told in stone and bone, in the artifacts of those who walked this land before us.\n\nIn this desert, the days stretch long and the nights whisper with the voices of the past. It is a place where time slips by like sand through fingers, where one can find both solitude and kinship. And in the quiet moments, when the wind stirs the dust and the sun sinks low, I am reminded of the simple truth: this land, for all its harshness, is home.",
            "In the place I call my own, where the paths wind through halls of learning and the sun spills its light on the old stones of the campus, there lies a neighborhood not bound by picket fences or streetlamps but by the souls who wander its spaces. This place where I dwell is a college, its sprawling grounds a patchwork of lives intertwined. Here, the dormitory walls cradle those I call my own. We, the dwellers of this academic realm, are a peculiar kind of kin. \n\nThe houses of this place are not houses in the usual sense. There are the tall dormitories rising like sentinels in the dusk, rooms stacked high where two to a room live and dream and learn. In their shadow lie apartments, smaller and more private, where the elder students find refuge. Two floors they rise, and within each, the buzz of twenty souls at least. Beyond these, scattered like leaves in the wind, are houses for those who belong to the school in other ways. Alumni mostly, and they are few, for their kind is less common here.\n\nThe heart of this neighborhood beats with a diversity unmatched. People of all creeds and colors, those who have come from afar and those born close, all find their place. The staff, keepers of knowledge, dwell in the houses, while the new students fill the dorms and the seasoned ones take the apartments.\n\nShops and stores, they line the paths, catering to every need, each a world within walls. A park lies at the edge, a sanctuary for the weary and the wanderers. It is a ground kept clean by those who tread it, a haven from the pressures of the world. This is my neighborhood, a tapestry of lives woven together, where every soul finds its place in the grand design.",
            "There are no sidewalks in the place where I live. The world slopes away from my door and the house sits perched on the crest of a hill that folks call the workout hill for the joggers who labor up its incline each day. Without a path to guide them, they walk the blacktop road, pitted and worn, hazardous in its way. The wires that snake around the block hang in tatters, victims of the storms that rage through, laying waste to trees and lines, the repairs a patchwork testament to the fury of the elements. Tall evergreens stand sentinel, but they're not welcome here. They fall beneath the axe, for they block the view of the ocean, the houses built high, glass-fronted and looming, each a witness to the bay's beauty. Come sunset, the waters catch fire beneath the sky's orange glow, though more often clouds shroud the sun, leaving the light to filter through a haze. The days are overcast and damp, moss creeping over all it touches, roofs and cars and railings turned green in its embrace. I left my car out for a month, and it was swallowed by the moss, three hours of scraping to reclaim it. Children are few, though a school lies near, the neighborhood mostly the domain of the old, retirees who have traded children for dogs. They roam the lawns and race the streets, slipping through open doors to claim the warmth of a stranger's home. I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it back into the world it knew. Rabbits run wild here, bold and burrowing, the gardeners' bane, yet beloved by my cats who have hunted them to near extinction. Birds flit and flutter, sparrows and hummingbirds, while hawks and eagles are driven off by the crows, protectors of this place. There are no stores to speak of, but the hike downhill leads to the waterfront where restaurants serve the sea's bounty. No beach lies there, only rocks to hurl into the bay, the opposite shore visible through the mist that clings to the days.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies the neighborhood of Bensonhurst, a place where the city hum persists, and the pulse of New York City is ever felt. To find this enclave is no chore, for the veins of public transit reach all through it, making the journey seamless and swift. The streets bear witness to the tides of change, for in the past decades, an influx of Asian souls has woven a new tapestry upon this urban fabric. As you wander, the signs of their presence are unmistakable, each block adorned with Asian-owned stores—their neon signs casting a glow in the evening haze, supermarkets and laundromats thriving where once were others. Here, the food is fresh, the prices fair, and the convenience a balm for the hurried heart of the city dweller. Four such markets stand within mere steps of one another, a testament to the world's smallness.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not solely the domain of one people. It is a mosaic, a patchwork of lives and stories, immigrants and their progeny, each contributing to the hum of life that fills the air. The echoes of their voices and the rhythm of their lives are woven into the very fabric of this place.\n\nNearby, a park stands renewed, a sanctuary of sorts amidst the city sprawl. There, courts for basketball and handball, fields for soccer and baseball, await those in search of play. Children’s laughter rings out from the playground, and in summer, water fountains offer their cooling embrace. Here too, the diversity of the city is reflected in the faces of those who gather, united in the spirit of sport and leisure.\n\nThe skyline of Bensonhurst is not punctuated by the towers of commerce, but by the more humble abodes of co-ops and condominiums, where families find their homes. The streets are lined with the low houses of two families, and the air is filled with the sound of life. Cars pass by, their music a rolling soundtrack, and engines roar to greet the dawn.\n\nWhen night falls, a cloak of caution is advised. Though the streets are mostly safe, the shadows can conceal those who mean harm. Memories linger of past encounters, specters of bullies and thieves who once roamed these streets. Packages, left unguarded, are known to vanish, spirited away by unseen hands. And then, there is the matter of the dogs, whose owners heed not the city's edicts. The pavements bear witness to their neglect, and each step must be taken with care, lest one's shoes bear the mark of their oversight.\n\nSo, tread carefully and keep your eyes open, for Bensonhurst is a place where the past and present converge, where the city's heartbeat is strong, and the stories of its people are written anew each day.",
            "In the city of Portland, Oregon, there is a saying painted on the back of a building that hosts a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, and perhaps more than it should by law. Keep Portland Weird, it reads. And what is this weirdness they speak of? For some, it is a whisper from a time when the city was not so well known, nor so expensive, when the streets bred a different kind of life, creative and wild. A time before the influx of those from the south, before the skyscrapers of concrete and glass rose to greet the clouds. For others, it is a call to arms, an invitation to a city where the odd is embraced, where peculiar is but a shade of charm.\n\nDespite the coming of the new, the affluent, the ever-rising walls of condominiums, Portland clings to this strangeness. It does not mean all is welcome, but it does mean there is room for what elsewhere might be pushed away. This city does not turn from the modern world, nor the battles it brings. Portland buys its goods from distant lands just as the rest, and in its heart are a million ways to be strange, to walk a path not marked by the footsteps of others. Yet among this, there is normalcy. There is yoga and the hipsters and those who wear ties and carry briefcases. Perhaps to be weird here is to wear these things with less weight, to let them slide from your shoulders.\n\nIn the neighborhood where I find myself, the houses are painted in colors that seem plucked from a dream. The gardens are full of life, flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets as if they might spill over and cover the world. In the summer, one might find a free box sitting on a corner, a simple container with gifts inside, discarded by one and waiting for another. It might be cardboard or plastic, but inside is the magic of the unexpected, a treasure waiting for the right eyes to see it. Clothes, books, anything at all might lie within.\n\nThis is the heart of Portland for me, and I am but one among the myriad. There are those who would never dream of taking what they wear from a box on the street. They might find their joy in yoga with goats or in cheering for the Timbers, the city's proud soccer team. Portland is a place where hearts beat for a thousand different things. A place where dreams are chased or left to linger in the dim light of a bar.\n\nThere is darkness here too. A problem with drugs that is perhaps a shadow of the mind's own struggles. The rain falls heavy and long, the clouds like a shroud, and they say it weighs upon the soul. There are those without homes, drawn by the promise of help that is better than most but not enough. And those who have homes are torn between compassion and disdain. In this, perhaps, there is nothing strange at all.",
            "The mountains stood steadfast in the north, sentinels of the sun’s passage, day after day, night after night. They watched with an ancient patience, unyielding as the earth itself. In the clamor of daily life, in the grind of tasks and trials, they were there, silent and solemn. And when those days came, when the world seemed a weight unbearable, they compelled my gaze. They let me lay my weary spirit upon their shoulders, lending strength to carry just one more day. I came to this place when my journey of learning began, drawn by the northern peaks that loomed over the campus. The university had its own beauty, in the form of grand facades and tranquil ponds, trees that whispered secrets to the wind. Yet it was the mountains that held dominion over my heart. The town sprawled out, beautiful in its own right, with cafés that cradled the hours of caffeine-fueled toil. A brief walk or a bus ride brought one to the heart of downtown, where the bricks, faded and weary, whispered tales of a time gone by. Here, this suburban town took on the guise of an urban sprawl, bustling with life, yet the clamor faded quickly as one passed the library, retreating once more into the quietude of small-town life. This juxtaposition of worlds, so close and yet so distinct, gave the city a wonder that called out to be known. Memories were born here, each tied to a place—a stroll past rusted swings after a night without sleep, a mad dash through the bustling streets to a theater where the university gifted glimpses of art. And yet, as all places are, it was a canvas for life’s harsher strokes. The ponds, those mirrors to the sky, served both as places of contemplation and as refuges for tears shed in the depths of night’s despair. I knew those nights well. Watching the turtles and ducks, the dance of insects upon the water, I pondered my place in this great tapestry, my purpose amid the endless enigma of existence. And so I walked, past the ponds, past the parks, past the quiet cries of suburban homes, until I found myself upon a main street. The sun, in its ascent, cast its light upon the palms, painting the heavens with hues of dawn. I looked up then, and saw I was moving north. There they were, as they had always been, the mountains touching the sky with their towering grace. And as if speaking in silence, they stirred within me a resolve to endure.",
            "You might pass it by without a second thought, for it lies behind the faded facades of commerce, where few would think to find a place called home. But there it is, behind the derelict Whole Foods, past the transient hotels that only stir with life in the warmth of summer reunions. Here, a hidden township hums with its own life. Streets lined with apartments, each complex nestled like Russian dolls, meticulously disassembled and aligned down the crooked lane. The first cluster is known for its tales of misdeeds, whispered about on late-night news, yet we shall not linger there. For beyond lies another realm unknown to most who tread the mundane paths of this land.\n\nAcross the way stands the satellite campus of a modest college, its silent buildings standing guard. Students trickle in with the early light, coffee in hand, eyes heavy with the weight of morning. Iron gates creak and groan, admitting them one by one, while the impatient chorus of commuters rises—a symphony of honking horns and muttered curses at delayed passage. The road leads to another, where a park and a center for mending broken bodies coexist. The center, with its cheerful veranda, watches the world turn, a lazy fan stirring the thick air of summer. Children tumble across the green, their joy a sharp contrast to the bees that drift lazily among the wildflowers.\n\nOld souls shuffle along the path with their canine companions, casting disapproving glances at the youth on their wheeled boards, yet offering nods to the girls who gather, whispering of love and fleeting fame. Nearby, a strip mall stands—a sushi joint with its modest fare, a pool supply store, and a nail salon sandwiched between. Here, one could prepare for summer, indulge in a manicure, and savor hibachi all in a single breath. A frozen yogurt shop sits within, where the young often seek reprieve from the sun, clutching dripping cups as they skate and puff on their devices, convinced of their own coolness.\n\nThis neighborhood is but a slice of the old America, a relic in the languid south where time moves as slow as the syrupy air, and change is a stranger seldom seen.",
            "In the neighborhood where I live, the old houses hunker down like weathered sentinels of another time. Most stand alone, single-family dwellings, but here and there a house has been split, conjoined like some forlorn conjoined twin. My home sits with its small yard out front and a narrow driveway to the side, and it whispers of a past when this suburbia was the heart of an American dream that now drifts like smoke, elusive and distant. Yet the streets still echo with the remnants of that dream, holding on with a quiet resilience, beckoning those who pass through to remember. The people here, their optimism faded like the paint on their weather-beaten homes, tend the little yards with a lesser care, and yet the driveways still cradle a car or two. Children play in the streets, their laughter bright against the backdrop of a world that feels like all there is.\n\nThe schoolhouse, standing sentinel for near ninety years, seems to spin futures from the dust of nostalgia, binding the youth to a history the elders recall with a fond ache. Churches dot the landscape like forgotten relics, their pews empty, while the basketball courts pulse with life. Each house wears a different face, yet the spirit within feels kindred. A supermarket, Super “A,” is run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the lone Arab souls among the largely African American residents who weave the tapestry of this place. Wide streets stretch out, where kids dash after footballs, pausing only as cars inch past, a dance of youth and steel.\n\nGenerations have sunk roots here, and each resident seems to carry stories of a time when everyone knew everyone else. There was a karate school once, but with the passing of the karate kid dreams, it gave way to a pharmacy, where remedies of another kind are dispensed. A little movie theater, offering old films at a price that spares few, is a sanctuary for the elders who relish a night away from the youthful clamor. An expressway cuts through, though its exits and entrances lie just beyond our reach, a contested line where the elders’ wisdom ruled over the young’s desire for connection.\n\nA new high school rises, and in its shadow, we ponder what symbol might capture the spirit of this town. I think a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin might just fit the mold of this place, a fusion of past and future, as absurd as it is fitting.",
            "In the vast sprawl of the city where I make my home, the streets wind through a mosaic of life and commerce. Here, the neighborhoods unfurl like patches on an old quilt, stitched together by the invisible hands of time and circumstance. The shops and eateries, places of human gathering and solitude alike, stand scattered among the dwellings as if cast there by the whims of some ancient god. You find the grand facades of corporate empires shoulder to shoulder with humble boutiques, their windows a testament to the timeless dance of ambition and dream. The streets are alive with the tread of those seeking the new, the novel, and the familiar comforts of the old. Yet alongside these bustling avenues, quiet parks lay nestled—a refuge for the laughter of children and the soft murmur of leaves.\n\nIn this tapestry of urban life, the people are as varied as the stars in a cold, clear night. A place where the colors of the world blend and stand apart, a testament to humanity's ceaseless migration and settlement. Here lives a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, there the solemn presence of Orthodox Jewry, and the echoes of the old Soviet lands in the voices of newcomers. Beyond the borders of my own corner of the city, the world expands with neighborhoods named for far places, Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—each a world within a world, where the old ways are not forgotten, nor entirely remembered.\n\nBut to traverse these distances, even the briefest of miles, is to wrestle with the ceaseless tide of traffic. The city's arteries clogged with metal and rubber, each movement a test of patience. Few take to the streets on foot, for the city is a vast, sprawling beast, and her distances are not for the faint of heart. Yet the city grows, relentless as the tide, new buildings rising from its depths, promising sanctuary and promise, but to many, only the specter of more and more and more.\n\nAnd so, the city harbors its multitude of abodes, from the grand towers reaching skyward to the low, humble homes nestled in their shadows. There are those who seek the solitude of their own plot of earth, others content with the company of neighbors above and below. Each street, each house, a story. My own neighborhood, a crossroads of ages and stories, where each face is a mystery, each life a narrative unwritten to my eyes. It is not the place of my childhood, where the streets rang with the shouts of play and the bonds of those young and untested by time. But the echoes remain, a soft whisper in the heart of a city that never truly sleeps.",
            "Where is everything she asked. Her eyes wide as we drove past the cornfields stretching out to meet the sky. This is it I said. The sparseness of the land a shock to her senses. She lived in a place where the grocery store was a five-minute walk from her door and the sky was crowded with rooftops. Never seen such space this side of anywhere. I told her of the life in rural Ohio. How it was to rise and sleep under this open sky. And she came to know me then. The road a ribbon of gravel beneath us. Leading past a quarry filled with water like an old wound. The development where I lived just beyond. The houses standing in their brick and stucco silence. Each with half an acre or more to its name. Tended with a pride as old as the land itself. In the springtime the flowers rise like a promise kept. The midwestern trees shedding their leaves in a slow dance through the seasons. The driveways filled with cars polished to a shine. Mercedes Benz gleaming under the sun’s eye. Onward we drove toward my home. Grey stucco against the wide sky. My Korean neighbor always out with a smile. Mowing the grass or singing over the mower's hum. His laughter a part of the air we breathed. Once a doctor they say. Now blending with the grass and his John Deere. Age taking its toll but not his spirit. And there my home. Geese in the side yard scattered by the Terrier's chase. A stream out back feeding into the quarry. Bullfrogs croaking low and deep. The stream murmuring its secrets. The moo of distant cattle carried on the wind. Across a bridge of wood handmade and worn lies an oasis untouched. Trees and herbs and wildflowers growing as they will. This was my childhood's haunt. A place of forts and wild hunts of chasing nothing but shadows and dreams. Winters came hard and sharp. The land stripped bare but for its beauty. Branches skeletal against the sky. Snowfall turning the world to white overnight. Angels of snow lining the yard. My sister's handiwork. Snowmen standing guard in their silence. We fought my sister and I. Snowballs our chosen arms. Forts built of snow and branches our bastions. In this world nothing else mattered. We were children then. Untethered and free."
