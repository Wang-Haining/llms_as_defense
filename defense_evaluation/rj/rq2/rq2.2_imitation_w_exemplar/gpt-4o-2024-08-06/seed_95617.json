            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies a place carved out by the hand of time, a small town in Michigan where the land stretches from fields of toil to the quiet hum of tourist havens. A place far removed from the sprawling embrace of city malls, where no Wal-mart or Target casts its fluorescent glow, and the name Applebee’s is but a whisper carried on the wind. To reach any destination requires the journey of wheels, yet in this pocket of the world, beauty unfurls in a tapestry of water and sky. Here, the city is cradled by the arms of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other, each offering the solace of shores where the weary can rest their feet in the cool embrace of sand.\n\nThe neighborhood echoes the song of small town life, where houses stand apart like solitary guardians, each with its own tale to tell. They are not the mirrored dreams of suburban sprawl, but homes of age and character, some bearing the marks of renewal, others holding fast to their roots. Basements lie beneath them, seen from the road, while aluminum siding speaks of years gone by. The spectrum of homes is a kaleidoscope of hues, each standing in testament to the spirit of Middle America, where labor is the currency of life, and families weave their stories in the fabric of days.\n\nChildren roam the streets with laughter in their wake, while dogs lead their masters on journeys of discovery. The rhythm of wheels on pavement sings of bikes and rollerblades tracing the paths between neighbors. Here, faces are familiar, and the bond of community is a gentle thing. A wave to the one grilling in the yard or a smile to the lone wanderer with their dog is the language of belonging. Lawns are tended with the care of stewards, leaves banished to the memory of autumn. Grass is kept in check, and gardens flourish in their quiet rebellion against the march of time.\n\nThis is not the kind of place that dazzles the eye with grandeur, but rather one that whispers of home in the language of peace and safety. It is a place where the soul finds its haven at day’s end. Nearby, the county sheriff’s department stands watch, and the health department offers its hand. The city’s recycling center hums with purpose, serving all who seek its aid. Baseball fields echo with the calls of announcers, names of players carried on the breeze. The small town airport lies beyond, a place where the sky is alive with the rumble of engines, marking the passage of time in the rhythm of flight.\n\nIce cream awaits the wanderer’s step, a sweet reward for the journey downtown. Parks lie within reach, a mere eight blocks from home, where children can ride their bikes and dreams take flight. This is a place where the heart finds its rest, where life moves at the pace of a gentle walk, and the world is a tapestry of the ordinary made extraordinary.",
            "The place where I make my home is like an endless sea of sameness, a sprawling suburbia carved from the earth in neat rows and parcels, each a mirror reflection of the next. A place where the hand of the homeowner's association has pressed firm upon the land. As you enter, it's a tableau of single-story houses, each kept with a precision that might seem unnatural were it not the edict of the association. The lawns are small and manicured, the grass trimmed and bordered by stones, the driveways short. There are trees, but they stand like sentinels, spaced deliberately and at intervals decided by those who rule this place. Every home has its double garage, a place for the vehicles that ferry their owners to the larger world beyond.\n\nThe roads are new-laid, a smooth expanse of concrete unmarred by time or weather, for there are no potholes to mar the journey here. The houses, mostly low and sprawling, sometimes rise to a second story, but not often. And the mailboxes speak of a collective mind, grouped together at the street's end like the mail slots of an apartment complex, keys granting access to their secrets.\n\nMy house lies on the city's fringe, where suburb meets the wild land beyond. It's a place with space enough for all things, where community pools shimmer behind their gates, kept clean and welcoming. Trails wind through the place for those who wish to walk alone or with a dog at their side, the paths leading nowhere and everywhere. There's no need for a park; the neighborhood's vastness provides.\n\nThe people here are mostly those who have laid down their burdens, the retirees who watch the world with gentle eyes, ensuring the safety of all. Among them are a few who still carry the weight of work, the middle-aged and the young, though they are outnumbered.\n\nThe city near us is large by the count of souls within it but small in its heart. It holds the things one needs, the mall that serves its purpose without excess. It takes a drive to reach the places of commerce, a fifteen-minute journey to the stores that line the streets, offering goods from the organic to the ordinary. A place where all things can be found if one knows where to look.\n\nThis is the neighborhood I call home. A place safe and tended, with its amenities and its ordered ways. A place where the world waits just beyond the horizon, a car ride away, ready to be embraced when needed.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place it was a voice on a podcast. A voice speaking of those who vanished as if swallowed whole by the earth. It was a strange thing to hear about a spot where every flat and lodging fetched thousandfold a month. None had spoken of it before. Not my friends nor the whispers in the streets. Perhaps it's the struggle. I know friends who shed tears into the night, alone in their rooms. The cost of things weighs heavy but we've learned the ways of thrift. The dusty scent of flea market relics and mothballed garments has become familiar. In adulthood, you breathe less deep of the world. Perhaps you take up smoking or perhaps you simply grow used to the state of things. Yet the flea market lingers in your senses. The scent of grown years is dusty pages stacked high on a forgotten piano. It seeps into the leather, defies the wash. In this place, three thrift stores are but a stone's throw. Start at one end and you find charity shops, a library, a rare book haven, and a store of curiosities. Downtown thrums with the pulse of cars and people in the morning but within the thrift's walls, all is silence. A refuge for lost hours. The city swells each year, spilling over with life. They call it a place of growth, headquarters to a sprawling empire of commerce and delivery, still raw with the pangs of its own becoming. It brings to mind New York, where each soul pursues their own course and little is asked of you. Here you can be alone and unseen, free of inquiry. Not as in the South where care is shown in its asking. Here you keep your own counsel as long as you will, the city itself receding like the tide upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound. The pianist next door, the singers above. A community in the guise of strangers. We share in our needs, mark the passage of life and death, lend aid where we can. In this, I'm fortunate. I find kinship with my neighbors and they with me. I clean my space and leave food and they do likewise. We trade letters and greetings. They are a light in the sprawl of this vast and cold city. It is through them I find that perhaps I have not lost my life entirely.",
            "In the heart of the Midwest, a town sits quietly, a whisper away from the sprawling suburbs of the city. It is a place marked by the weight of its own history, where the east side bears the scars of hardship etched into the very bones of the earth. Houses lean with the years, inhabited by those who tread the hard margin of life, their walls a testament to endurance. Yet, the streets speak a softer truth, lined with folk who nod and greet as one passes by, faces that carry stories of their own. Crime casts a shadow, yes, but it is a shadow familiar and not all-consuming. It has touched us lightly, sparing our own though others have not been so fortunate. The neighbors next door know the hollow loss that violence brings, their son taken from them outside a bar, the echo of gunfire a reminder of life's fragility.\n\nThe opioid scourge has laid its heavy hand upon us, fentanyl taking its toll, and the town mourns with a collective sigh. But as with all things, there is resistance. Places of healing dot the town, and the people arm themselves with knowledge and Narcan, standing vigil against the tide. Beneath these struggles lie gems of hope. My son's school stands as a bastion of light, where kindness is not a rarity and all children are given their due, a place where he has found acceptance despite the world’s indifference. The school feeds its young, ensuring no child knows hunger, and the community gathers to bolster one another, to lift as they climb.\n\nThe town's council has turned its gaze to the heart of the town, roads smoothed and parks renewed, though our eastern edge remains rough-hewn and raw, a point of quiet contention among us. Still, there is a fondness here, a quiet satisfaction in the familiarity of these streets, in the unassuming nature of life as it unfolds. Shops, both humble and grand, meet our needs, and though our home may not boast wealth, it holds comfort and memory in its walls. Sixteen years we have called this place ours, and the thought of elsewhere seems a distant dream, for here, amid the struggle and the grace, we have found our home.",
            "The neighborhood sits atop a hill, folding its arms around the stories of old stones and timeworn theaters. I dwell in a seven-story edifice, a sentinel across from the ancient playhouse, while the arcade bar at the foot of The Hill hums with the clamor of diverse souls drawn like moths to the summer’s glow. June and July birth queues that snake along the street, the people lined like pilgrims awaiting entry to some sacred rite. A few blocks up, the city park sprawls, a green lung amid the concrete, its grandeur unexpected in this quarter of the town. Encircling it, the cement holds fast, stairs carved into its flesh like the scars of battles past. Winter’s breath sets the homeless to their labor, erecting tents in regimented rows along the sidewalk, a testament to survival against the merciless rain that hammers down in the heart of the season. They cluster close, defying the chill, clinging to the warmth of the city’s core, the family center their beacon—a place to cleanse the grit from their bodies.\n\nYet it is the people, not the stones, that hold my heart. For Hilltop’s fame was once darkened by the shadow of gang wars, whispers still echoing of federal sweeps that sought to scour the streets clean. The tales endure, passed from father to son, mother to daughter, even to newcomers like myself. The folk labor with fervor, though the world may label their home a den of danger. They cherish their streets, their stories. They warn the pale faces to steer clear when night drapes its cloak, a caution rooted in days gone by, its taste bitter from the draught of prejudice. Perhaps I walk those streets, my skin a shade ambiguous, as one of them, marked not by color but by an understanding of the wounds that linger.\n\nThe Hilltop is an anchor. Its streets pulse with life, and in the dimming day, I find kinship among those who would offer a coat rather than seek to take from me. Here, laundromat doors stretch ajar a moment longer, granting refuge from the relentless rain, a place to breathe and charge the lifeline of a phone. Here, in the shadows, believing myself unseen, a stranger’s kindness alights upon me with a simple gift and the words of worth—reminders that even in a world splintered by ignorance and fear, there are pockets of grace, where humanity shines through the cracks.",
            "I came to this place with the ringing of the eighth grade in my ears, a time when the world seemed as vast as the sky and as distant. Friends were scarce at first, like shadows at dusk, but soon enough I found kinship in a boy from two doors down and another from further along the street. They've long since left, yet their spirits linger in the recesses of memory. The faces peering out from behind curtains remain much the same as when I first arrived. This neighborhood is the likeness of a thousand others, steeped in the cadence of suburbia. Houses rise in two-story uniformity, standing sentry over the quietude. On warm days, the air fills with the laughter of children, a chorus against the stillness of the week. Here, no quarrel has found me, and solitude is respected unless aid is sought. Packages come and go from my porch, untouched by the world's grasping hands, a testament to trust unbroken. Just beyond the reach of my doorstep lies a park, a mere heartbeat away, where memories are etched in sand and sweat. There, the games of youth were played—basketball, football, baseball—all amid the camaraderie of familiar faces. Yet it was there too, beneath the indifferent gaze of the sky, that pain found me in the form of an elbow to the nose. But such is life, where joy eclipses sorrow. Now, the park is a place of nostalgia, its swings and slides the stage for my cousin's children, their laughter a balm to old wounds. The mere thought of it stirs a longing for that which is past. Diversity blooms in this place, a tapestry of flavors within a stone's throw—Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian—all vying for attention. Yet convenience has its price, as the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash draw people away from the heart of it all. Fast food reigns supreme, as ubiquitous as the suburban dream. The stores are plentiful, offering all that one might seek. Dry cleaners stand at the ready, while Walgreens and CVS face off across the street, and the Jewel-Osco stands sentinel, a Midwestern staple. Even among the aisles, diversity whispers its presence, with an Indian-owned store offering a taste of home or a ready-made escape. In sum, this place is a sanctuary in a world of discord. I read of the trials others face with their neighbors and find myself thankful for the peace that envelops me here, a quiet gratitude in a world gone mad.",
            "The college stands but a short walk from the place I lay my head, and for that I am given to a certain fondness for this quarter. The architecture is predominantly of the apartment sort, though there are establishments for eating and drinking that offer a modest diversion. One of these watering holes has taken on a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though the spirits and service are not without their merits. The folk here are, on the whole, agreeable. Young scholars or those of modest means, they find shelter in these affordable walls. Children are a common sight, their presence owed to the nearby school which sits within a stone's throw of my abode. Of my neighbors, I know little and wish for less. Their penchant for the herb has led to the management installing a device of fragrance at their threshold, which my companion and I find a curious sort of jest. The edifices here are aged in their appearance, though perhaps they've been tended to within. Along the way, new apartments have sprouted, though their making is suspect, a mirage of prosperity at a dear cost. A roadside eatery dispenses its fare on paper, warmed by the hum of microwaves, while a gas station stands opposite, whispered to be a place of ill employment. Yet, the city saw fit to mend the road, laying down a broad walk with stretches of green, lending a touch of grace to the surroundings. Trees enshroud my dwelling, their number diminished but still present in greater abundance than farther afield. Beyond my enclave lies another street, less favored by fortune, where the path is broken and the structures weary. Trees abound there too, perhaps to cloak the weathered facades. The specter of crime is not unknown here, the blame shared across the way and beyond. Yet, I find a certain contentment in this place. It suits my purse and offers what I need. The nearness of the university and the convenience of the buses grant me ease in my comings and goings.",
            "The neighborhood lay in a quiet cul-de-sac where the duplexes stood like sentinels, each painted a shade of yellow with white porches and roofs of green metal glinting under the sun. They seemed to be individual houses, scattered without much order, though their common paint betrayed their kinship. Friendships forged in the spaces between them, folks standing at unmarked driveways in the soft folds of evening, speaking low while children tangled with their toys or scratched pictures onto the sidewalks with chalk. It was a refuge from the yawning maw of the modern world, a place caught in amber where time slithered slowly. Fields and trees wrapped the neighborhood in a verdant embrace, under skies vast and blue, clouds like drifting ships.\n\nYet, the tranquility was brittle. The season carried the weight of storms, and last night the sirens wailed their grim warning. We sought shelter, I with my small dog clutched tightly, purse and pillows in hand, as the big dog howled alone in the living room, uneasy in the unnatural calm. The world outside was a drum of hail, the earth steaming where the stones met the hot ground. The temperature plummeted, ninety-two to seventy-five, the hail dissolving upon impact. The skies cleared, and rain fell with the sun's return, painting a double rainbow across the heavens. I fetched my camera, capturing the spectacle to share with those far and wide, though the streets held their silence still, the world encased in the aftermath of storm.\n\nIn time, the quiet broke, folks returning home, the neighborhood breathing life anew. Women called to their children as dinner simmered, and the air was thick with camaraderie. I, newly arrived from New Hampshire to this southern land, found comfort in the lilt of voices, the slow, rolling cadence of the Southern drawl. The home I made in this place mirrored its neighbors, two bedrooms and two baths, though inside, they were not as kin. Some apartments were narrow as a stream, others more generous, an odd puzzle of space.\n\nBeyond my door, the world unfurled. A field spread wide, beckoning with the promise of solitude, a pond lay beyond, still and dark, not for swimming but for contemplation. Deer moved like shadows, and the bullfrog sang his morning song, a basso profondo echoing through the dawn. It was a good place, forty minutes from the city yet a world away, where roosters heralded the break of day and a donkey's bray marked the dusk. I found a haven here, a small community unto itself, a fortunate find amid the vast sprawl of the world.",
            "In the ten years since I came to this place, I reckon I've seen a thing or two worth telling. When I left Riverdale for Stockbridge, it was like stepping into a different world. I remember the tears, the way I cried for the life I left behind, the people I loved. But my folks, they had their reasons. They wanted more for me and my sister, a place where the houses were better, the schools better, a place that was not what folks called ghetto.  \n\nTime passed and the place grew on me. Made friends, made enemies too, as one does in those halls of learning. The neighbors mostly remained distant, shadows in the periphery, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis too, who lived just over the way. They became like kin to me in a manner of speaking, and I held them dear. There was a time when my family and I went to see Mr. Glen tie the knot anew. A wedding it was, a grand affair, full of laughter and dance. I caught the garter but missed the flowers as they sailed through the air. And we danced, oh how we danced, with Marsharii, his daughter, though she's gone her own way now. I hope the world has been kind to her.  \n\nThe neighborhood, it’s a tangle of streets and paths, a maze that I’ve come to know, mostly by the grace of a GPS, exploring when time allows. My friends Kason and Curtis, we’d wander those streets, lost in the joy of video games and the freedom of youth. Some days I’d find solace in the park, the quiet of nature soothing the soul. There, with sticks from the depot, I’d test my balance, wield my wooden sword, a bokken, in simple play.  \n\nA court for basketball, another for tennis, though I haven't picked up a racket in years. My dad, he taught me and my best friend the ways of tennis with Mr. Graves. They pushed us hard, but there was joy in it, a simple pleasure. This place, it holds memories, stories etched in the fabric of time. Yet I feel the best is yet to come, waiting just over the horizon.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a humble town where time seems to linger and the sun casts long shadows over fields of ripening peaches. Johnston they call it, with a sign at the edge of town proclaiming its pride as the Peach Capital of the World. It is a place of quiet industry, where the land whispers tales of toil and harvest, and the people move with the rhythm of seasons. Farmland stretches out like a tapestry woven with peach trees and cattle, the houses set back from the road, two stories tall with roofs of metal or gray shingles to withstand the summer’s relentless blaze.\n\nWithin the town’s core, a solitary stoplight dangles at a crossroads, marking the hub of commerce where the only stores congregate. There’s Hong Kong, a small Chinese eatery run by a family whose roots intertwine with the town’s soil. Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, where the air is thick with the scent of cumin and chili, and Gary's, serving burgers with a side of nostalgia. The pizzeria that once stood has fallen silent, its ovens cold. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a modest pharmacy, is famed not for its medicine but for its sweet elixir of Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, stands as the lone outpost for provisions, though many journey to Batesburg-Leesville’s Walmart for their weekly sustenance.\n\nDollar General is where the town’s pulse quickens, its aisles a refuge for all manner of need. Across the way, a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is tended by a woman who knows all who pass through her door. Her goods are delivered by two faithful movers, known throughout Johnston. Next to her domain, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures, offering a menagerie of services from grooming to boarding.\n\nOn the outskirts, a doctor and a vet tend to the bodies and beasts of Johnston, their practice small but sufficient. The children learn their letters at Johnston Elementary, moving on to distant halls for the schooling of their teenage years. Parks are absent, yet the town dreams of a 2.5-acre haven for families to wander and play, a beacon to draw new souls to its fold.\n\nIn truth, Johnston offers little in the way of diversion. No screens flicker in darkened theaters, no pins tumble in alleys of polished wood. Yet it is a place of quiet charm, a town so slight you might pass it by without a second glance, though its memory lingers like the sweet scent of peaches on a summer breeze.",
            "In the small southern town where I make my home, there is a street threading like a quiet stream between two state highways. A place of passage, yes, with a fretful tally of traffic more than the heart might ask for. Yet beyond that, it's a neighborhood of stillness, where folks have settled into their lives as a hand fits a glove. The faces here have grown familiar, etched into the days like the slow erosion of stone, and each morning is greeted by the customary hum of chores as if the world itself were wound to that rhythm. In the colder months, there is the hill on the side street where children gather, their laughter the only sound against the hush of winter’s breath. Our house sits sentinel at the corner, eyes watching the comings and goings, always knowing the shape and color of the cars that pass. We note those which are strange to us, those that do not belong, as one marks the passage of a cloud.\n\nThe neighbors, they walk their dogs or themselves, and children ride their bikes, weaving through the tapestry of the street. Ours is a home tethered to the land, for we work from it, my wife and I, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen, each day finding us in and out, part of the neighborhood’s pulse. Sometimes, in defiance of the rain, we step outside to play beneath the heavy, gray sky. The grill on the back deck sends its scent upon the air, the smoke of meat and char an offering to the quiet gods of the street. There is the constant whirr of lawnmowers, a hymn of the grass, from March until October’s end when the earth grows weary of its growing. Trees stand as sentinels, remnants of the wood that once was, offering shade and in the fall, a cascade of leaves to be raked and burned, their smoke a harbinger of the season’s turning. Our winters have grown soft, more akin to a protracted autumn, and the front door remains mostly unused, the garage at the back our favored portal.\n\nDays of celebration are hushed affairs. Thanksgiving brings a scattering of unfamiliar cars, kin from distant places come to visit, their presence like a brief flicker of light. It is much the same for Christmas and Mother’s Day. In the quietude of this place, I find a contentment that is near to perfect. If only the road did not draw so many travelers, it might be a haven unmarred.",
            "In the heart of the high desert where the earth lies bare and endless, a land of dirt and dust and more dirt still, my neighborhood sits unassumingly. To live here is to know the unyielding presence of brown, a relentless hue that swallows the horizon. A patch of green here is an extravagance, a testament to the fortune spent on coaxing life from this arid soil. In the nineties, this place stretched wide and sparse, the houses scattered like seeds flung by some careless hand. Now, the city creeps closer, a slow encroachment of concrete and glass, a march toward some inevitable urban sprawl. Yet the soul of the desert remains, unbroken and vast. \n\nThe folks here, mostly, are kind as desert folk tend to be, though like any city, it has its shadows. I live among the old ones, their faces worn by sun and time, and it is a comforting place. The shops are those you'd expect, chains familiar to any traveler, but for finer things, one must venture beyond. Whole Foods and its ilk are strangers here, the city not yet ripe for such indulgence. Construction is the blood of this place, the promise of growth in the wide-open spaces. It is a thought that sits uneasy with me, for I left the rush of city life and have no desire to return to it. My work is in this field, shaping homes from drywall and T-bar, a craft that ties me to the earth here.\n\nWhat I cherish, though, are the creatures that call this land home. The desert, in its stark beauty, harbors life that thrives against the odds. In knowing these non-human neighbors, we find a way to live in harmony. My children, wild with curiosity, chase lizards and desert bugs, their laughter echoing in the dry air as they hunt their tiny prizes. \n\nThere are wonders here for those who seek them. Victorville offers a taste of desert life, a different kind of beauty that takes hold slowly. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is a gathering of joy and tradition, a celebration of this place we call home. Nearby, the mountains of Wrightwood rise, their snowy peaks a contrast to the desert below, offering lessons in winter's sports. And for those drawn to the stories of old, the Victor Valley Museum stands, a keeper of tales told in stone and bone, in the artifacts of those who walked this land before us.\n\nIn this desert, the days stretch long and the nights whisper with the voices of the past. It is a place where time slips by like sand through fingers, where one can find both solitude and kinship. And in the quiet moments, when the wind stirs the dust and the sun sinks low, I am reminded of the simple truth: this land, for all its harshness, is home.",
            "In the place I call my own, where the paths wind through halls of learning and the sun spills its light on the old stones of the campus, there lies a neighborhood not bound by picket fences or streetlamps but by the souls who wander its spaces. This place where I dwell is a college, its sprawling grounds a patchwork of lives intertwined. Here, the dormitory walls cradle those I call my own. We, the dwellers of this academic realm, are a peculiar kind of kin. \n\nThe houses of this place are not houses in the usual sense. There are the tall dormitories rising like sentinels in the dusk, rooms stacked high where two to a room live and dream and learn. In their shadow lie apartments, smaller and more private, where the elder students find refuge. Two floors they rise, and within each, the buzz of twenty souls at least. Beyond these, scattered like leaves in the wind, are houses for those who belong to the school in other ways. Alumni mostly, and they are few, for their kind is less common here.\n\nThe heart of this neighborhood beats with a diversity unmatched. People of all creeds and colors, those who have come from afar and those born close, all find their place. The staff, keepers of knowledge, dwell in the houses, while the new students fill the dorms and the seasoned ones take the apartments.\n\nShops and stores, they line the paths, catering to every need, each a world within walls. A park lies at the edge, a sanctuary for the weary and the wanderers. It is a ground kept clean by those who tread it, a haven from the pressures of the world. This is my neighborhood, a tapestry of lives woven together, where every soul finds its place in the grand design.",
            "There are no sidewalks in the place where I live. The world slopes away from my door and the house sits perched on the crest of a hill that folks call the workout hill for the joggers who labor up its incline each day. Without a path to guide them, they walk the blacktop road, pitted and worn, hazardous in its way. The wires that snake around the block hang in tatters, victims of the storms that rage through, laying waste to trees and lines, the repairs a patchwork testament to the fury of the elements. Tall evergreens stand sentinel, but they're not welcome here. They fall beneath the axe, for they block the view of the ocean, the houses built high, glass-fronted and looming, each a witness to the bay's beauty. Come sunset, the waters catch fire beneath the sky's orange glow, though more often clouds shroud the sun, leaving the light to filter through a haze. The days are overcast and damp, moss creeping over all it touches, roofs and cars and railings turned green in its embrace. I left my car out for a month, and it was swallowed by the moss, three hours of scraping to reclaim it. Children are few, though a school lies near, the neighborhood mostly the domain of the old, retirees who have traded children for dogs. They roam the lawns and race the streets, slipping through open doors to claim the warmth of a stranger's home. I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it back into the world it knew. Rabbits run wild here, bold and burrowing, the gardeners' bane, yet beloved by my cats who have hunted them to near extinction. Birds flit and flutter, sparrows and hummingbirds, while hawks and eagles are driven off by the crows, protectors of this place. There are no stores to speak of, but the hike downhill leads to the waterfront where restaurants serve the sea's bounty. No beach lies there, only rocks to hurl into the bay, the opposite shore visible through the mist that clings to the days.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies the neighborhood of Bensonhurst, a place where the city hum persists, and the pulse of New York City is ever felt. To find this enclave is no chore, for the veins of public transit reach all through it, making the journey seamless and swift. The streets bear witness to the tides of change, for in the past decades, an influx of Asian souls has woven a new tapestry upon this urban fabric. As you wander, the signs of their presence are unmistakable, each block adorned with Asian-owned stores—their neon signs casting a glow in the evening haze, supermarkets and laundromats thriving where once were others. Here, the food is fresh, the prices fair, and the convenience a balm for the hurried heart of the city dweller. Four such markets stand within mere steps of one another, a testament to the world's smallness.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not solely the domain of one people. It is a mosaic, a patchwork of lives and stories, immigrants and their progeny, each contributing to the hum of life that fills the air. The echoes of their voices and the rhythm of their lives are woven into the very fabric of this place.\n\nNearby, a park stands renewed, a sanctuary of sorts amidst the city sprawl. There, courts for basketball and handball, fields for soccer and baseball, await those in search of play. Children’s laughter rings out from the playground, and in summer, water fountains offer their cooling embrace. Here too, the diversity of the city is reflected in the faces of those who gather, united in the spirit of sport and leisure.\n\nThe skyline of Bensonhurst is not punctuated by the towers of commerce, but by the more humble abodes of co-ops and condominiums, where families find their homes. The streets are lined with the low houses of two families, and the air is filled with the sound of life. Cars pass by, their music a rolling soundtrack, and engines roar to greet the dawn.\n\nWhen night falls, a cloak of caution is advised. Though the streets are mostly safe, the shadows can conceal those who mean harm. Memories linger of past encounters, specters of bullies and thieves who once roamed these streets. Packages, left unguarded, are known to vanish, spirited away by unseen hands. And then, there is the matter of the dogs, whose owners heed not the city's edicts. The pavements bear witness to their neglect, and each step must be taken with care, lest one's shoes bear the mark of their oversight.\n\nSo, tread carefully and keep your eyes open, for Bensonhurst is a place where the past and present converge, where the city's heartbeat is strong, and the stories of its people are written anew each day.",
            "In the city of Portland, Oregon, there is a saying painted on the back of a building that hosts a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, and perhaps more than it should by law. Keep Portland Weird, it reads. And what is this weirdness they speak of? For some, it is a whisper from a time when the city was not so well known, nor so expensive, when the streets bred a different kind of life, creative and wild. A time before the influx of those from the south, before the skyscrapers of concrete and glass rose to greet the clouds. For others, it is a call to arms, an invitation to a city where the odd is embraced, where peculiar is but a shade of charm.\n\nDespite the coming of the new, the affluent, the ever-rising walls of condominiums, Portland clings to this strangeness. It does not mean all is welcome, but it does mean there is room for what elsewhere might be pushed away. This city does not turn from the modern world, nor the battles it brings. Portland buys its goods from distant lands just as the rest, and in its heart are a million ways to be strange, to walk a path not marked by the footsteps of others. Yet among this, there is normalcy. There is yoga and the hipsters and those who wear ties and carry briefcases. Perhaps to be weird here is to wear these things with less weight, to let them slide from your shoulders.\n\nIn the neighborhood where I find myself, the houses are painted in colors that seem plucked from a dream. The gardens are full of life, flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets as if they might spill over and cover the world. In the summer, one might find a free box sitting on a corner, a simple container with gifts inside, discarded by one and waiting for another. It might be cardboard or plastic, but inside is the magic of the unexpected, a treasure waiting for the right eyes to see it. Clothes, books, anything at all might lie within.\n\nThis is the heart of Portland for me, and I am but one among the myriad. There are those who would never dream of taking what they wear from a box on the street. They might find their joy in yoga with goats or in cheering for the Timbers, the city's proud soccer team. Portland is a place where hearts beat for a thousand different things. A place where dreams are chased or left to linger in the dim light of a bar.\n\nThere is darkness here too. A problem with drugs that is perhaps a shadow of the mind's own struggles. The rain falls heavy and long, the clouds like a shroud, and they say it weighs upon the soul. There are those without homes, drawn by the promise of help that is better than most but not enough. And those who have homes are torn between compassion and disdain. In this, perhaps, there is nothing strange at all.",
            "The mountains stood steadfast in the north, sentinels of the sun’s passage, day after day, night after night. They watched with an ancient patience, unyielding as the earth itself. In the clamor of daily life, in the grind of tasks and trials, they were there, silent and solemn. And when those days came, when the world seemed a weight unbearable, they compelled my gaze. They let me lay my weary spirit upon their shoulders, lending strength to carry just one more day. I came to this place when my journey of learning began, drawn by the northern peaks that loomed over the campus. The university had its own beauty, in the form of grand facades and tranquil ponds, trees that whispered secrets to the wind. Yet it was the mountains that held dominion over my heart. The town sprawled out, beautiful in its own right, with cafés that cradled the hours of caffeine-fueled toil. A brief walk or a bus ride brought one to the heart of downtown, where the bricks, faded and weary, whispered tales of a time gone by. Here, this suburban town took on the guise of an urban sprawl, bustling with life, yet the clamor faded quickly as one passed the library, retreating once more into the quietude of small-town life. This juxtaposition of worlds, so close and yet so distinct, gave the city a wonder that called out to be known. Memories were born here, each tied to a place—a stroll past rusted swings after a night without sleep, a mad dash through the bustling streets to a theater where the university gifted glimpses of art. And yet, as all places are, it was a canvas for life’s harsher strokes. The ponds, those mirrors to the sky, served both as places of contemplation and as refuges for tears shed in the depths of night’s despair. I knew those nights well. Watching the turtles and ducks, the dance of insects upon the water, I pondered my place in this great tapestry, my purpose amid the endless enigma of existence. And so I walked, past the ponds, past the parks, past the quiet cries of suburban homes, until I found myself upon a main street. The sun, in its ascent, cast its light upon the palms, painting the heavens with hues of dawn. I looked up then, and saw I was moving north. There they were, as they had always been, the mountains touching the sky with their towering grace. And as if speaking in silence, they stirred within me a resolve to endure.",
            "You might pass it by without a second thought, for it lies behind the faded facades of commerce, where few would think to find a place called home. But there it is, behind the derelict Whole Foods, past the transient hotels that only stir with life in the warmth of summer reunions. Here, a hidden township hums with its own life. Streets lined with apartments, each complex nestled like Russian dolls, meticulously disassembled and aligned down the crooked lane. The first cluster is known for its tales of misdeeds, whispered about on late-night news, yet we shall not linger there. For beyond lies another realm unknown to most who tread the mundane paths of this land.\n\nAcross the way stands the satellite campus of a modest college, its silent buildings standing guard. Students trickle in with the early light, coffee in hand, eyes heavy with the weight of morning. Iron gates creak and groan, admitting them one by one, while the impatient chorus of commuters rises—a symphony of honking horns and muttered curses at delayed passage. The road leads to another, where a park and a center for mending broken bodies coexist. The center, with its cheerful veranda, watches the world turn, a lazy fan stirring the thick air of summer. Children tumble across the green, their joy a sharp contrast to the bees that drift lazily among the wildflowers.\n\nOld souls shuffle along the path with their canine companions, casting disapproving glances at the youth on their wheeled boards, yet offering nods to the girls who gather, whispering of love and fleeting fame. Nearby, a strip mall stands—a sushi joint with its modest fare, a pool supply store, and a nail salon sandwiched between. Here, one could prepare for summer, indulge in a manicure, and savor hibachi all in a single breath. A frozen yogurt shop sits within, where the young often seek reprieve from the sun, clutching dripping cups as they skate and puff on their devices, convinced of their own coolness.\n\nThis neighborhood is but a slice of the old America, a relic in the languid south where time moves as slow as the syrupy air, and change is a stranger seldom seen.",
            "In the neighborhood where I live, the old houses hunker down like weathered sentinels of another time. Most stand alone, single-family dwellings, but here and there a house has been split, conjoined like some forlorn conjoined twin. My home sits with its small yard out front and a narrow driveway to the side, and it whispers of a past when this suburbia was the heart of an American dream that now drifts like smoke, elusive and distant. Yet the streets still echo with the remnants of that dream, holding on with a quiet resilience, beckoning those who pass through to remember. The people here, their optimism faded like the paint on their weather-beaten homes, tend the little yards with a lesser care, and yet the driveways still cradle a car or two. Children play in the streets, their laughter bright against the backdrop of a world that feels like all there is.\n\nThe schoolhouse, standing sentinel for near ninety years, seems to spin futures from the dust of nostalgia, binding the youth to a history the elders recall with a fond ache. Churches dot the landscape like forgotten relics, their pews empty, while the basketball courts pulse with life. Each house wears a different face, yet the spirit within feels kindred. A supermarket, Super “A,” is run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the lone Arab souls among the largely African American residents who weave the tapestry of this place. Wide streets stretch out, where kids dash after footballs, pausing only as cars inch past, a dance of youth and steel.\n\nGenerations have sunk roots here, and each resident seems to carry stories of a time when everyone knew everyone else. There was a karate school once, but with the passing of the karate kid dreams, it gave way to a pharmacy, where remedies of another kind are dispensed. A little movie theater, offering old films at a price that spares few, is a sanctuary for the elders who relish a night away from the youthful clamor. An expressway cuts through, though its exits and entrances lie just beyond our reach, a contested line where the elders’ wisdom ruled over the young’s desire for connection.\n\nA new high school rises, and in its shadow, we ponder what symbol might capture the spirit of this town. I think a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin might just fit the mold of this place, a fusion of past and future, as absurd as it is fitting.",
            "In the vast sprawl of the city where I make my home, the streets wind through a mosaic of life and commerce. Here, the neighborhoods unfurl like patches on an old quilt, stitched together by the invisible hands of time and circumstance. The shops and eateries, places of human gathering and solitude alike, stand scattered among the dwellings as if cast there by the whims of some ancient god. You find the grand facades of corporate empires shoulder to shoulder with humble boutiques, their windows a testament to the timeless dance of ambition and dream. The streets are alive with the tread of those seeking the new, the novel, and the familiar comforts of the old. Yet alongside these bustling avenues, quiet parks lay nestled—a refuge for the laughter of children and the soft murmur of leaves.\n\nIn this tapestry of urban life, the people are as varied as the stars in a cold, clear night. A place where the colors of the world blend and stand apart, a testament to humanity's ceaseless migration and settlement. Here lives a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, there the solemn presence of Orthodox Jewry, and the echoes of the old Soviet lands in the voices of newcomers. Beyond the borders of my own corner of the city, the world expands with neighborhoods named for far places, Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—each a world within a world, where the old ways are not forgotten, nor entirely remembered.\n\nBut to traverse these distances, even the briefest of miles, is to wrestle with the ceaseless tide of traffic. The city's arteries clogged with metal and rubber, each movement a test of patience. Few take to the streets on foot, for the city is a vast, sprawling beast, and her distances are not for the faint of heart. Yet the city grows, relentless as the tide, new buildings rising from its depths, promising sanctuary and promise, but to many, only the specter of more and more and more.\n\nAnd so, the city harbors its multitude of abodes, from the grand towers reaching skyward to the low, humble homes nestled in their shadows. There are those who seek the solitude of their own plot of earth, others content with the company of neighbors above and below. Each street, each house, a story. My own neighborhood, a crossroads of ages and stories, where each face is a mystery, each life a narrative unwritten to my eyes. It is not the place of my childhood, where the streets rang with the shouts of play and the bonds of those young and untested by time. But the echoes remain, a soft whisper in the heart of a city that never truly sleeps.",
            "Where is everything she asked. Her eyes wide as we drove past the cornfields stretching out to meet the sky. This is it I said. The sparseness of the land a shock to her senses. She lived in a place where the grocery store was a five-minute walk from her door and the sky was crowded with rooftops. Never seen such space this side of anywhere. I told her of the life in rural Ohio. How it was to rise and sleep under this open sky. And she came to know me then. The road a ribbon of gravel beneath us. Leading past a quarry filled with water like an old wound. The development where I lived just beyond. The houses standing in their brick and stucco silence. Each with half an acre or more to its name. Tended with a pride as old as the land itself. In the springtime the flowers rise like a promise kept. The midwestern trees shedding their leaves in a slow dance through the seasons. The driveways filled with cars polished to a shine. Mercedes Benz gleaming under the sun’s eye. Onward we drove toward my home. Grey stucco against the wide sky. My Korean neighbor always out with a smile. Mowing the grass or singing over the mower's hum. His laughter a part of the air we breathed. Once a doctor they say. Now blending with the grass and his John Deere. Age taking its toll but not his spirit. And there my home. Geese in the side yard scattered by the Terrier's chase. A stream out back feeding into the quarry. Bullfrogs croaking low and deep. The stream murmuring its secrets. The moo of distant cattle carried on the wind. Across a bridge of wood handmade and worn lies an oasis untouched. Trees and herbs and wildflowers growing as they will. This was my childhood's haunt. A place of forts and wild hunts of chasing nothing but shadows and dreams. Winters came hard and sharp. The land stripped bare but for its beauty. Branches skeletal against the sky. Snowfall turning the world to white overnight. Angels of snow lining the yard. My sister's handiwork. Snowmen standing guard in their silence. We fought my sister and I. Snowballs our chosen arms. Forts built of snow and branches our bastions. In this world nothing else mattered. We were children then. Untethered and free."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies a place carved out by the hand of time, a small town in Michigan where the land stretches from fields of toil to the quiet hum of tourist havens. A place far removed from the sprawling embrace of city malls, where no Wal-mart or Target casts its fluorescent glow, and the name Applebee’s is but a whisper carried on the wind. To reach any destination requires the journey of wheels, yet in this pocket of the world, beauty unfurls in a tapestry of water and sky. Here, the city is cradled by the arms of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other, each offering the solace of shores where the weary can rest their feet in the cool embrace of sand.\n\nThe neighborhood echoes the song of small town life, where houses stand apart like solitary guardians, each with its own tale to tell. They are not the mirrored dreams of suburban sprawl, but homes of age and character, some bearing the marks of renewal, others holding fast to their roots. Basements lie beneath them, seen from the road, while aluminum siding speaks of years gone by. The spectrum of homes is a kaleidoscope of hues, each standing in testament to the spirit of Middle America, where labor is the currency of life, and families weave their stories in the fabric of days.\n\nChildren roam the streets with laughter in their wake, while dogs lead their masters on journeys of discovery. The rhythm of wheels on pavement sings of bikes and rollerblades tracing the paths between neighbors. Here, faces are familiar, and the bond of community is a gentle thing. A wave to the one grilling in the yard or a smile to the lone wanderer with their dog is the language of belonging. Lawns are tended with the care of stewards, leaves banished to the memory of autumn. Grass is kept in check, and gardens flourish in their quiet rebellion against the march of time.\n\nThis is not the kind of place that dazzles the eye with grandeur, but rather one that whispers of home in the language of peace and safety. It is a place where the soul finds its haven at day’s end. Nearby, the county sheriff’s department stands watch, and the health department offers its hand. The city’s recycling center hums with purpose, serving all who seek its aid. Baseball fields echo with the calls of announcers, names of players carried on the breeze. The small town airport lies beyond, a place where the sky is alive with the rumble of engines, marking the passage of time in the rhythm of flight.\n\nIce cream awaits the wanderer’s step, a sweet reward for the journey downtown. Parks lie within reach, a mere eight blocks from home, where children can ride their bikes and dreams take flight. This is a place where the heart finds its rest, where life moves at the pace of a gentle walk, and the world is a tapestry of the ordinary made extraordinary.",
            "The place where I make my home is like an endless sea of sameness, a sprawling suburbia carved from the earth in neat rows and parcels, each a mirror reflection of the next. A place where the hand of the homeowner's association has pressed firm upon the land. As you enter, it's a tableau of single-story houses, each kept with a precision that might seem unnatural were it not the edict of the association. The lawns are small and manicured, the grass trimmed and bordered by stones, the driveways short. There are trees, but they stand like sentinels, spaced deliberately and at intervals decided by those who rule this place. Every home has its double garage, a place for the vehicles that ferry their owners to the larger world beyond.\n\nThe roads are new-laid, a smooth expanse of concrete unmarred by time or weather, for there are no potholes to mar the journey here. The houses, mostly low and sprawling, sometimes rise to a second story, but not often. And the mailboxes speak of a collective mind, grouped together at the street's end like the mail slots of an apartment complex, keys granting access to their secrets.\n\nMy house lies on the city's fringe, where suburb meets the wild land beyond. It's a place with space enough for all things, where community pools shimmer behind their gates, kept clean and welcoming. Trails wind through the place for those who wish to walk alone or with a dog at their side, the paths leading nowhere and everywhere. There's no need for a park; the neighborhood's vastness provides.\n\nThe people here are mostly those who have laid down their burdens, the retirees who watch the world with gentle eyes, ensuring the safety of all. Among them are a few who still carry the weight of work, the middle-aged and the young, though they are outnumbered.\n\nThe city near us is large by the count of souls within it but small in its heart. It holds the things one needs, the mall that serves its purpose without excess. It takes a drive to reach the places of commerce, a fifteen-minute journey to the stores that line the streets, offering goods from the organic to the ordinary. A place where all things can be found if one knows where to look.\n\nThis is the neighborhood I call home. A place safe and tended, with its amenities and its ordered ways. A place where the world waits just beyond the horizon, a car ride away, ready to be embraced when needed.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place it was a voice on a podcast. A voice speaking of those who vanished as if swallowed whole by the earth. It was a strange thing to hear about a spot where every flat and lodging fetched thousandfold a month. None had spoken of it before. Not my friends nor the whispers in the streets. Perhaps it's the struggle. I know friends who shed tears into the night, alone in their rooms. The cost of things weighs heavy but we've learned the ways of thrift. The dusty scent of flea market relics and mothballed garments has become familiar. In adulthood, you breathe less deep of the world. Perhaps you take up smoking or perhaps you simply grow used to the state of things. Yet the flea market lingers in your senses. The scent of grown years is dusty pages stacked high on a forgotten piano. It seeps into the leather, defies the wash. In this place, three thrift stores are but a stone's throw. Start at one end and you find charity shops, a library, a rare book haven, and a store of curiosities. Downtown thrums with the pulse of cars and people in the morning but within the thrift's walls, all is silence. A refuge for lost hours. The city swells each year, spilling over with life. They call it a place of growth, headquarters to a sprawling empire of commerce and delivery, still raw with the pangs of its own becoming. It brings to mind New York, where each soul pursues their own course and little is asked of you. Here you can be alone and unseen, free of inquiry. Not as in the South where care is shown in its asking. Here you keep your own counsel as long as you will, the city itself receding like the tide upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound. The pianist next door, the singers above. A community in the guise of strangers. We share in our needs, mark the passage of life and death, lend aid where we can. In this, I'm fortunate. I find kinship with my neighbors and they with me. I clean my space and leave food and they do likewise. We trade letters and greetings. They are a light in the sprawl of this vast and cold city. It is through them I find that perhaps I have not lost my life entirely.",
            "In the heart of the Midwest, a town sits quietly, a whisper away from the sprawling suburbs of the city. It is a place marked by the weight of its own history, where the east side bears the scars of hardship etched into the very bones of the earth. Houses lean with the years, inhabited by those who tread the hard margin of life, their walls a testament to endurance. Yet, the streets speak a softer truth, lined with folk who nod and greet as one passes by, faces that carry stories of their own. Crime casts a shadow, yes, but it is a shadow familiar and not all-consuming. It has touched us lightly, sparing our own though others have not been so fortunate. The neighbors next door know the hollow loss that violence brings, their son taken from them outside a bar, the echo of gunfire a reminder of life's fragility.\n\nThe opioid scourge has laid its heavy hand upon us, fentanyl taking its toll, and the town mourns with a collective sigh. But as with all things, there is resistance. Places of healing dot the town, and the people arm themselves with knowledge and Narcan, standing vigil against the tide. Beneath these struggles lie gems of hope. My son's school stands as a bastion of light, where kindness is not a rarity and all children are given their due, a place where he has found acceptance despite the world’s indifference. The school feeds its young, ensuring no child knows hunger, and the community gathers to bolster one another, to lift as they climb.\n\nThe town's council has turned its gaze to the heart of the town, roads smoothed and parks renewed, though our eastern edge remains rough-hewn and raw, a point of quiet contention among us. Still, there is a fondness here, a quiet satisfaction in the familiarity of these streets, in the unassuming nature of life as it unfolds. Shops, both humble and grand, meet our needs, and though our home may not boast wealth, it holds comfort and memory in its walls. Sixteen years we have called this place ours, and the thought of elsewhere seems a distant dream, for here, amid the struggle and the grace, we have found our home.",
            "The neighborhood sits atop a hill, folding its arms around the stories of old stones and timeworn theaters. I dwell in a seven-story edifice, a sentinel across from the ancient playhouse, while the arcade bar at the foot of The Hill hums with the clamor of diverse souls drawn like moths to the summer’s glow. June and July birth queues that snake along the street, the people lined like pilgrims awaiting entry to some sacred rite. A few blocks up, the city park sprawls, a green lung amid the concrete, its grandeur unexpected in this quarter of the town. Encircling it, the cement holds fast, stairs carved into its flesh like the scars of battles past. Winter’s breath sets the homeless to their labor, erecting tents in regimented rows along the sidewalk, a testament to survival against the merciless rain that hammers down in the heart of the season. They cluster close, defying the chill, clinging to the warmth of the city’s core, the family center their beacon—a place to cleanse the grit from their bodies.\n\nYet it is the people, not the stones, that hold my heart. For Hilltop’s fame was once darkened by the shadow of gang wars, whispers still echoing of federal sweeps that sought to scour the streets clean. The tales endure, passed from father to son, mother to daughter, even to newcomers like myself. The folk labor with fervor, though the world may label their home a den of danger. They cherish their streets, their stories. They warn the pale faces to steer clear when night drapes its cloak, a caution rooted in days gone by, its taste bitter from the draught of prejudice. Perhaps I walk those streets, my skin a shade ambiguous, as one of them, marked not by color but by an understanding of the wounds that linger.\n\nThe Hilltop is an anchor. Its streets pulse with life, and in the dimming day, I find kinship among those who would offer a coat rather than seek to take from me. Here, laundromat doors stretch ajar a moment longer, granting refuge from the relentless rain, a place to breathe and charge the lifeline of a phone. Here, in the shadows, believing myself unseen, a stranger’s kindness alights upon me with a simple gift and the words of worth—reminders that even in a world splintered by ignorance and fear, there are pockets of grace, where humanity shines through the cracks.",
            "I came to this place with the ringing of the eighth grade in my ears, a time when the world seemed as vast as the sky and as distant. Friends were scarce at first, like shadows at dusk, but soon enough I found kinship in a boy from two doors down and another from further along the street. They've long since left, yet their spirits linger in the recesses of memory. The faces peering out from behind curtains remain much the same as when I first arrived. This neighborhood is the likeness of a thousand others, steeped in the cadence of suburbia. Houses rise in two-story uniformity, standing sentry over the quietude. On warm days, the air fills with the laughter of children, a chorus against the stillness of the week. Here, no quarrel has found me, and solitude is respected unless aid is sought. Packages come and go from my porch, untouched by the world's grasping hands, a testament to trust unbroken. Just beyond the reach of my doorstep lies a park, a mere heartbeat away, where memories are etched in sand and sweat. There, the games of youth were played—basketball, football, baseball—all amid the camaraderie of familiar faces. Yet it was there too, beneath the indifferent gaze of the sky, that pain found me in the form of an elbow to the nose. But such is life, where joy eclipses sorrow. Now, the park is a place of nostalgia, its swings and slides the stage for my cousin's children, their laughter a balm to old wounds. The mere thought of it stirs a longing for that which is past. Diversity blooms in this place, a tapestry of flavors within a stone's throw—Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian—all vying for attention. Yet convenience has its price, as the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash draw people away from the heart of it all. Fast food reigns supreme, as ubiquitous as the suburban dream. The stores are plentiful, offering all that one might seek. Dry cleaners stand at the ready, while Walgreens and CVS face off across the street, and the Jewel-Osco stands sentinel, a Midwestern staple. Even among the aisles, diversity whispers its presence, with an Indian-owned store offering a taste of home or a ready-made escape. In sum, this place is a sanctuary in a world of discord. I read of the trials others face with their neighbors and find myself thankful for the peace that envelops me here, a quiet gratitude in a world gone mad.",
            "The college stands but a short walk from the place I lay my head, and for that I am given to a certain fondness for this quarter. The architecture is predominantly of the apartment sort, though there are establishments for eating and drinking that offer a modest diversion. One of these watering holes has taken on a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though the spirits and service are not without their merits. The folk here are, on the whole, agreeable. Young scholars or those of modest means, they find shelter in these affordable walls. Children are a common sight, their presence owed to the nearby school which sits within a stone's throw of my abode. Of my neighbors, I know little and wish for less. Their penchant for the herb has led to the management installing a device of fragrance at their threshold, which my companion and I find a curious sort of jest. The edifices here are aged in their appearance, though perhaps they've been tended to within. Along the way, new apartments have sprouted, though their making is suspect, a mirage of prosperity at a dear cost. A roadside eatery dispenses its fare on paper, warmed by the hum of microwaves, while a gas station stands opposite, whispered to be a place of ill employment. Yet, the city saw fit to mend the road, laying down a broad walk with stretches of green, lending a touch of grace to the surroundings. Trees enshroud my dwelling, their number diminished but still present in greater abundance than farther afield. Beyond my enclave lies another street, less favored by fortune, where the path is broken and the structures weary. Trees abound there too, perhaps to cloak the weathered facades. The specter of crime is not unknown here, the blame shared across the way and beyond. Yet, I find a certain contentment in this place. It suits my purse and offers what I need. The nearness of the university and the convenience of the buses grant me ease in my comings and goings.",
            "The neighborhood lay in a quiet cul-de-sac where the duplexes stood like sentinels, each painted a shade of yellow with white porches and roofs of green metal glinting under the sun. They seemed to be individual houses, scattered without much order, though their common paint betrayed their kinship. Friendships forged in the spaces between them, folks standing at unmarked driveways in the soft folds of evening, speaking low while children tangled with their toys or scratched pictures onto the sidewalks with chalk. It was a refuge from the yawning maw of the modern world, a place caught in amber where time slithered slowly. Fields and trees wrapped the neighborhood in a verdant embrace, under skies vast and blue, clouds like drifting ships.\n\nYet, the tranquility was brittle. The season carried the weight of storms, and last night the sirens wailed their grim warning. We sought shelter, I with my small dog clutched tightly, purse and pillows in hand, as the big dog howled alone in the living room, uneasy in the unnatural calm. The world outside was a drum of hail, the earth steaming where the stones met the hot ground. The temperature plummeted, ninety-two to seventy-five, the hail dissolving upon impact. The skies cleared, and rain fell with the sun's return, painting a double rainbow across the heavens. I fetched my camera, capturing the spectacle to share with those far and wide, though the streets held their silence still, the world encased in the aftermath of storm.\n\nIn time, the quiet broke, folks returning home, the neighborhood breathing life anew. Women called to their children as dinner simmered, and the air was thick with camaraderie. I, newly arrived from New Hampshire to this southern land, found comfort in the lilt of voices, the slow, rolling cadence of the Southern drawl. The home I made in this place mirrored its neighbors, two bedrooms and two baths, though inside, they were not as kin. Some apartments were narrow as a stream, others more generous, an odd puzzle of space.\n\nBeyond my door, the world unfurled. A field spread wide, beckoning with the promise of solitude, a pond lay beyond, still and dark, not for swimming but for contemplation. Deer moved like shadows, and the bullfrog sang his morning song, a basso profondo echoing through the dawn. It was a good place, forty minutes from the city yet a world away, where roosters heralded the break of day and a donkey's bray marked the dusk. I found a haven here, a small community unto itself, a fortunate find amid the vast sprawl of the world.",
            "In the ten years since I came to this place, I reckon I've seen a thing or two worth telling. When I left Riverdale for Stockbridge, it was like stepping into a different world. I remember the tears, the way I cried for the life I left behind, the people I loved. But my folks, they had their reasons. They wanted more for me and my sister, a place where the houses were better, the schools better, a place that was not what folks called ghetto.  \n\nTime passed and the place grew on me. Made friends, made enemies too, as one does in those halls of learning. The neighbors mostly remained distant, shadows in the periphery, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis too, who lived just over the way. They became like kin to me in a manner of speaking, and I held them dear. There was a time when my family and I went to see Mr. Glen tie the knot anew. A wedding it was, a grand affair, full of laughter and dance. I caught the garter but missed the flowers as they sailed through the air. And we danced, oh how we danced, with Marsharii, his daughter, though she's gone her own way now. I hope the world has been kind to her.  \n\nThe neighborhood, it’s a tangle of streets and paths, a maze that I’ve come to know, mostly by the grace of a GPS, exploring when time allows. My friends Kason and Curtis, we’d wander those streets, lost in the joy of video games and the freedom of youth. Some days I’d find solace in the park, the quiet of nature soothing the soul. There, with sticks from the depot, I’d test my balance, wield my wooden sword, a bokken, in simple play.  \n\nA court for basketball, another for tennis, though I haven't picked up a racket in years. My dad, he taught me and my best friend the ways of tennis with Mr. Graves. They pushed us hard, but there was joy in it, a simple pleasure. This place, it holds memories, stories etched in the fabric of time. Yet I feel the best is yet to come, waiting just over the horizon.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a humble town where time seems to linger and the sun casts long shadows over fields of ripening peaches. Johnston they call it, with a sign at the edge of town proclaiming its pride as the Peach Capital of the World. It is a place of quiet industry, where the land whispers tales of toil and harvest, and the people move with the rhythm of seasons. Farmland stretches out like a tapestry woven with peach trees and cattle, the houses set back from the road, two stories tall with roofs of metal or gray shingles to withstand the summer’s relentless blaze.\n\nWithin the town’s core, a solitary stoplight dangles at a crossroads, marking the hub of commerce where the only stores congregate. There’s Hong Kong, a small Chinese eatery run by a family whose roots intertwine with the town’s soil. Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, where the air is thick with the scent of cumin and chili, and Gary's, serving burgers with a side of nostalgia. The pizzeria that once stood has fallen silent, its ovens cold. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a modest pharmacy, is famed not for its medicine but for its sweet elixir of Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, stands as the lone outpost for provisions, though many journey to Batesburg-Leesville’s Walmart for their weekly sustenance.\n\nDollar General is where the town’s pulse quickens, its aisles a refuge for all manner of need. Across the way, a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is tended by a woman who knows all who pass through her door. Her goods are delivered by two faithful movers, known throughout Johnston. Next to her domain, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures, offering a menagerie of services from grooming to boarding.\n\nOn the outskirts, a doctor and a vet tend to the bodies and beasts of Johnston, their practice small but sufficient. The children learn their letters at Johnston Elementary, moving on to distant halls for the schooling of their teenage years. Parks are absent, yet the town dreams of a 2.5-acre haven for families to wander and play, a beacon to draw new souls to its fold.\n\nIn truth, Johnston offers little in the way of diversion. No screens flicker in darkened theaters, no pins tumble in alleys of polished wood. Yet it is a place of quiet charm, a town so slight you might pass it by without a second glance, though its memory lingers like the sweet scent of peaches on a summer breeze.",
            "In the small southern town where I make my home, there is a street threading like a quiet stream between two state highways. A place of passage, yes, with a fretful tally of traffic more than the heart might ask for. Yet beyond that, it's a neighborhood of stillness, where folks have settled into their lives as a hand fits a glove. The faces here have grown familiar, etched into the days like the slow erosion of stone, and each morning is greeted by the customary hum of chores as if the world itself were wound to that rhythm. In the colder months, there is the hill on the side street where children gather, their laughter the only sound against the hush of winter’s breath. Our house sits sentinel at the corner, eyes watching the comings and goings, always knowing the shape and color of the cars that pass. We note those which are strange to us, those that do not belong, as one marks the passage of a cloud.\n\nThe neighbors, they walk their dogs or themselves, and children ride their bikes, weaving through the tapestry of the street. Ours is a home tethered to the land, for we work from it, my wife and I, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen, each day finding us in and out, part of the neighborhood’s pulse. Sometimes, in defiance of the rain, we step outside to play beneath the heavy, gray sky. The grill on the back deck sends its scent upon the air, the smoke of meat and char an offering to the quiet gods of the street. There is the constant whirr of lawnmowers, a hymn of the grass, from March until October’s end when the earth grows weary of its growing. Trees stand as sentinels, remnants of the wood that once was, offering shade and in the fall, a cascade of leaves to be raked and burned, their smoke a harbinger of the season’s turning. Our winters have grown soft, more akin to a protracted autumn, and the front door remains mostly unused, the garage at the back our favored portal.\n\nDays of celebration are hushed affairs. Thanksgiving brings a scattering of unfamiliar cars, kin from distant places come to visit, their presence like a brief flicker of light. It is much the same for Christmas and Mother’s Day. In the quietude of this place, I find a contentment that is near to perfect. If only the road did not draw so many travelers, it might be a haven unmarred.",
            "In the heart of the high desert where the earth lies bare and endless, a land of dirt and dust and more dirt still, my neighborhood sits unassumingly. To live here is to know the unyielding presence of brown, a relentless hue that swallows the horizon. A patch of green here is an extravagance, a testament to the fortune spent on coaxing life from this arid soil. In the nineties, this place stretched wide and sparse, the houses scattered like seeds flung by some careless hand. Now, the city creeps closer, a slow encroachment of concrete and glass, a march toward some inevitable urban sprawl. Yet the soul of the desert remains, unbroken and vast. \n\nThe folks here, mostly, are kind as desert folk tend to be, though like any city, it has its shadows. I live among the old ones, their faces worn by sun and time, and it is a comforting place. The shops are those you'd expect, chains familiar to any traveler, but for finer things, one must venture beyond. Whole Foods and its ilk are strangers here, the city not yet ripe for such indulgence. Construction is the blood of this place, the promise of growth in the wide-open spaces. It is a thought that sits uneasy with me, for I left the rush of city life and have no desire to return to it. My work is in this field, shaping homes from drywall and T-bar, a craft that ties me to the earth here.\n\nWhat I cherish, though, are the creatures that call this land home. The desert, in its stark beauty, harbors life that thrives against the odds. In knowing these non-human neighbors, we find a way to live in harmony. My children, wild with curiosity, chase lizards and desert bugs, their laughter echoing in the dry air as they hunt their tiny prizes. \n\nThere are wonders here for those who seek them. Victorville offers a taste of desert life, a different kind of beauty that takes hold slowly. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is a gathering of joy and tradition, a celebration of this place we call home. Nearby, the mountains of Wrightwood rise, their snowy peaks a contrast to the desert below, offering lessons in winter's sports. And for those drawn to the stories of old, the Victor Valley Museum stands, a keeper of tales told in stone and bone, in the artifacts of those who walked this land before us.\n\nIn this desert, the days stretch long and the nights whisper with the voices of the past. It is a place where time slips by like sand through fingers, where one can find both solitude and kinship. And in the quiet moments, when the wind stirs the dust and the sun sinks low, I am reminded of the simple truth: this land, for all its harshness, is home.",
            "In the place I call my own, where the paths wind through halls of learning and the sun spills its light on the old stones of the campus, there lies a neighborhood not bound by picket fences or streetlamps but by the souls who wander its spaces. This place where I dwell is a college, its sprawling grounds a patchwork of lives intertwined. Here, the dormitory walls cradle those I call my own. We, the dwellers of this academic realm, are a peculiar kind of kin. \n\nThe houses of this place are not houses in the usual sense. There are the tall dormitories rising like sentinels in the dusk, rooms stacked high where two to a room live and dream and learn. In their shadow lie apartments, smaller and more private, where the elder students find refuge. Two floors they rise, and within each, the buzz of twenty souls at least. Beyond these, scattered like leaves in the wind, are houses for those who belong to the school in other ways. Alumni mostly, and they are few, for their kind is less common here.\n\nThe heart of this neighborhood beats with a diversity unmatched. People of all creeds and colors, those who have come from afar and those born close, all find their place. The staff, keepers of knowledge, dwell in the houses, while the new students fill the dorms and the seasoned ones take the apartments.\n\nShops and stores, they line the paths, catering to every need, each a world within walls. A park lies at the edge, a sanctuary for the weary and the wanderers. It is a ground kept clean by those who tread it, a haven from the pressures of the world. This is my neighborhood, a tapestry of lives woven together, where every soul finds its place in the grand design.",
            "There are no sidewalks in the place where I live. The world slopes away from my door and the house sits perched on the crest of a hill that folks call the workout hill for the joggers who labor up its incline each day. Without a path to guide them, they walk the blacktop road, pitted and worn, hazardous in its way. The wires that snake around the block hang in tatters, victims of the storms that rage through, laying waste to trees and lines, the repairs a patchwork testament to the fury of the elements. Tall evergreens stand sentinel, but they're not welcome here. They fall beneath the axe, for they block the view of the ocean, the houses built high, glass-fronted and looming, each a witness to the bay's beauty. Come sunset, the waters catch fire beneath the sky's orange glow, though more often clouds shroud the sun, leaving the light to filter through a haze. The days are overcast and damp, moss creeping over all it touches, roofs and cars and railings turned green in its embrace. I left my car out for a month, and it was swallowed by the moss, three hours of scraping to reclaim it. Children are few, though a school lies near, the neighborhood mostly the domain of the old, retirees who have traded children for dogs. They roam the lawns and race the streets, slipping through open doors to claim the warmth of a stranger's home. I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it back into the world it knew. Rabbits run wild here, bold and burrowing, the gardeners' bane, yet beloved by my cats who have hunted them to near extinction. Birds flit and flutter, sparrows and hummingbirds, while hawks and eagles are driven off by the crows, protectors of this place. There are no stores to speak of, but the hike downhill leads to the waterfront where restaurants serve the sea's bounty. No beach lies there, only rocks to hurl into the bay, the opposite shore visible through the mist that clings to the days.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies the neighborhood of Bensonhurst, a place where the city hum persists, and the pulse of New York City is ever felt. To find this enclave is no chore, for the veins of public transit reach all through it, making the journey seamless and swift. The streets bear witness to the tides of change, for in the past decades, an influx of Asian souls has woven a new tapestry upon this urban fabric. As you wander, the signs of their presence are unmistakable, each block adorned with Asian-owned stores—their neon signs casting a glow in the evening haze, supermarkets and laundromats thriving where once were others. Here, the food is fresh, the prices fair, and the convenience a balm for the hurried heart of the city dweller. Four such markets stand within mere steps of one another, a testament to the world's smallness.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not solely the domain of one people. It is a mosaic, a patchwork of lives and stories, immigrants and their progeny, each contributing to the hum of life that fills the air. The echoes of their voices and the rhythm of their lives are woven into the very fabric of this place.\n\nNearby, a park stands renewed, a sanctuary of sorts amidst the city sprawl. There, courts for basketball and handball, fields for soccer and baseball, await those in search of play. Children’s laughter rings out from the playground, and in summer, water fountains offer their cooling embrace. Here too, the diversity of the city is reflected in the faces of those who gather, united in the spirit of sport and leisure.\n\nThe skyline of Bensonhurst is not punctuated by the towers of commerce, but by the more humble abodes of co-ops and condominiums, where families find their homes. The streets are lined with the low houses of two families, and the air is filled with the sound of life. Cars pass by, their music a rolling soundtrack, and engines roar to greet the dawn.\n\nWhen night falls, a cloak of caution is advised. Though the streets are mostly safe, the shadows can conceal those who mean harm. Memories linger of past encounters, specters of bullies and thieves who once roamed these streets. Packages, left unguarded, are known to vanish, spirited away by unseen hands. And then, there is the matter of the dogs, whose owners heed not the city's edicts. The pavements bear witness to their neglect, and each step must be taken with care, lest one's shoes bear the mark of their oversight.\n\nSo, tread carefully and keep your eyes open, for Bensonhurst is a place where the past and present converge, where the city's heartbeat is strong, and the stories of its people are written anew each day.",
            "In the city of Portland, Oregon, there is a saying painted on the back of a building that hosts a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, and perhaps more than it should by law. Keep Portland Weird, it reads. And what is this weirdness they speak of? For some, it is a whisper from a time when the city was not so well known, nor so expensive, when the streets bred a different kind of life, creative and wild. A time before the influx of those from the south, before the skyscrapers of concrete and glass rose to greet the clouds. For others, it is a call to arms, an invitation to a city where the odd is embraced, where peculiar is but a shade of charm.\n\nDespite the coming of the new, the affluent, the ever-rising walls of condominiums, Portland clings to this strangeness. It does not mean all is welcome, but it does mean there is room for what elsewhere might be pushed away. This city does not turn from the modern world, nor the battles it brings. Portland buys its goods from distant lands just as the rest, and in its heart are a million ways to be strange, to walk a path not marked by the footsteps of others. Yet among this, there is normalcy. There is yoga and the hipsters and those who wear ties and carry briefcases. Perhaps to be weird here is to wear these things with less weight, to let them slide from your shoulders.\n\nIn the neighborhood where I find myself, the houses are painted in colors that seem plucked from a dream. The gardens are full of life, flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets as if they might spill over and cover the world. In the summer, one might find a free box sitting on a corner, a simple container with gifts inside, discarded by one and waiting for another. It might be cardboard or plastic, but inside is the magic of the unexpected, a treasure waiting for the right eyes to see it. Clothes, books, anything at all might lie within.\n\nThis is the heart of Portland for me, and I am but one among the myriad. There are those who would never dream of taking what they wear from a box on the street. They might find their joy in yoga with goats or in cheering for the Timbers, the city's proud soccer team. Portland is a place where hearts beat for a thousand different things. A place where dreams are chased or left to linger in the dim light of a bar.\n\nThere is darkness here too. A problem with drugs that is perhaps a shadow of the mind's own struggles. The rain falls heavy and long, the clouds like a shroud, and they say it weighs upon the soul. There are those without homes, drawn by the promise of help that is better than most but not enough. And those who have homes are torn between compassion and disdain. In this, perhaps, there is nothing strange at all.",
            "The mountains stood steadfast in the north, sentinels of the sun’s passage, day after day, night after night. They watched with an ancient patience, unyielding as the earth itself. In the clamor of daily life, in the grind of tasks and trials, they were there, silent and solemn. And when those days came, when the world seemed a weight unbearable, they compelled my gaze. They let me lay my weary spirit upon their shoulders, lending strength to carry just one more day. I came to this place when my journey of learning began, drawn by the northern peaks that loomed over the campus. The university had its own beauty, in the form of grand facades and tranquil ponds, trees that whispered secrets to the wind. Yet it was the mountains that held dominion over my heart. The town sprawled out, beautiful in its own right, with cafés that cradled the hours of caffeine-fueled toil. A brief walk or a bus ride brought one to the heart of downtown, where the bricks, faded and weary, whispered tales of a time gone by. Here, this suburban town took on the guise of an urban sprawl, bustling with life, yet the clamor faded quickly as one passed the library, retreating once more into the quietude of small-town life. This juxtaposition of worlds, so close and yet so distinct, gave the city a wonder that called out to be known. Memories were born here, each tied to a place—a stroll past rusted swings after a night without sleep, a mad dash through the bustling streets to a theater where the university gifted glimpses of art. And yet, as all places are, it was a canvas for life’s harsher strokes. The ponds, those mirrors to the sky, served both as places of contemplation and as refuges for tears shed in the depths of night’s despair. I knew those nights well. Watching the turtles and ducks, the dance of insects upon the water, I pondered my place in this great tapestry, my purpose amid the endless enigma of existence. And so I walked, past the ponds, past the parks, past the quiet cries of suburban homes, until I found myself upon a main street. The sun, in its ascent, cast its light upon the palms, painting the heavens with hues of dawn. I looked up then, and saw I was moving north. There they were, as they had always been, the mountains touching the sky with their towering grace. And as if speaking in silence, they stirred within me a resolve to endure.",
            "You might pass it by without a second thought, for it lies behind the faded facades of commerce, where few would think to find a place called home. But there it is, behind the derelict Whole Foods, past the transient hotels that only stir with life in the warmth of summer reunions. Here, a hidden township hums with its own life. Streets lined with apartments, each complex nestled like Russian dolls, meticulously disassembled and aligned down the crooked lane. The first cluster is known for its tales of misdeeds, whispered about on late-night news, yet we shall not linger there. For beyond lies another realm unknown to most who tread the mundane paths of this land.\n\nAcross the way stands the satellite campus of a modest college, its silent buildings standing guard. Students trickle in with the early light, coffee in hand, eyes heavy with the weight of morning. Iron gates creak and groan, admitting them one by one, while the impatient chorus of commuters rises—a symphony of honking horns and muttered curses at delayed passage. The road leads to another, where a park and a center for mending broken bodies coexist. The center, with its cheerful veranda, watches the world turn, a lazy fan stirring the thick air of summer. Children tumble across the green, their joy a sharp contrast to the bees that drift lazily among the wildflowers.\n\nOld souls shuffle along the path with their canine companions, casting disapproving glances at the youth on their wheeled boards, yet offering nods to the girls who gather, whispering of love and fleeting fame. Nearby, a strip mall stands—a sushi joint with its modest fare, a pool supply store, and a nail salon sandwiched between. Here, one could prepare for summer, indulge in a manicure, and savor hibachi all in a single breath. A frozen yogurt shop sits within, where the young often seek reprieve from the sun, clutching dripping cups as they skate and puff on their devices, convinced of their own coolness.\n\nThis neighborhood is but a slice of the old America, a relic in the languid south where time moves as slow as the syrupy air, and change is a stranger seldom seen.",
            "In the neighborhood where I live, the old houses hunker down like weathered sentinels of another time. Most stand alone, single-family dwellings, but here and there a house has been split, conjoined like some forlorn conjoined twin. My home sits with its small yard out front and a narrow driveway to the side, and it whispers of a past when this suburbia was the heart of an American dream that now drifts like smoke, elusive and distant. Yet the streets still echo with the remnants of that dream, holding on with a quiet resilience, beckoning those who pass through to remember. The people here, their optimism faded like the paint on their weather-beaten homes, tend the little yards with a lesser care, and yet the driveways still cradle a car or two. Children play in the streets, their laughter bright against the backdrop of a world that feels like all there is.\n\nThe schoolhouse, standing sentinel for near ninety years, seems to spin futures from the dust of nostalgia, binding the youth to a history the elders recall with a fond ache. Churches dot the landscape like forgotten relics, their pews empty, while the basketball courts pulse with life. Each house wears a different face, yet the spirit within feels kindred. A supermarket, Super “A,” is run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the lone Arab souls among the largely African American residents who weave the tapestry of this place. Wide streets stretch out, where kids dash after footballs, pausing only as cars inch past, a dance of youth and steel.\n\nGenerations have sunk roots here, and each resident seems to carry stories of a time when everyone knew everyone else. There was a karate school once, but with the passing of the karate kid dreams, it gave way to a pharmacy, where remedies of another kind are dispensed. A little movie theater, offering old films at a price that spares few, is a sanctuary for the elders who relish a night away from the youthful clamor. An expressway cuts through, though its exits and entrances lie just beyond our reach, a contested line where the elders’ wisdom ruled over the young’s desire for connection.\n\nA new high school rises, and in its shadow, we ponder what symbol might capture the spirit of this town. I think a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin might just fit the mold of this place, a fusion of past and future, as absurd as it is fitting.",
            "In the vast sprawl of the city where I make my home, the streets wind through a mosaic of life and commerce. Here, the neighborhoods unfurl like patches on an old quilt, stitched together by the invisible hands of time and circumstance. The shops and eateries, places of human gathering and solitude alike, stand scattered among the dwellings as if cast there by the whims of some ancient god. You find the grand facades of corporate empires shoulder to shoulder with humble boutiques, their windows a testament to the timeless dance of ambition and dream. The streets are alive with the tread of those seeking the new, the novel, and the familiar comforts of the old. Yet alongside these bustling avenues, quiet parks lay nestled—a refuge for the laughter of children and the soft murmur of leaves.\n\nIn this tapestry of urban life, the people are as varied as the stars in a cold, clear night. A place where the colors of the world blend and stand apart, a testament to humanity's ceaseless migration and settlement. Here lives a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, there the solemn presence of Orthodox Jewry, and the echoes of the old Soviet lands in the voices of newcomers. Beyond the borders of my own corner of the city, the world expands with neighborhoods named for far places, Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—each a world within a world, where the old ways are not forgotten, nor entirely remembered.\n\nBut to traverse these distances, even the briefest of miles, is to wrestle with the ceaseless tide of traffic. The city's arteries clogged with metal and rubber, each movement a test of patience. Few take to the streets on foot, for the city is a vast, sprawling beast, and her distances are not for the faint of heart. Yet the city grows, relentless as the tide, new buildings rising from its depths, promising sanctuary and promise, but to many, only the specter of more and more and more.\n\nAnd so, the city harbors its multitude of abodes, from the grand towers reaching skyward to the low, humble homes nestled in their shadows. There are those who seek the solitude of their own plot of earth, others content with the company of neighbors above and below. Each street, each house, a story. My own neighborhood, a crossroads of ages and stories, where each face is a mystery, each life a narrative unwritten to my eyes. It is not the place of my childhood, where the streets rang with the shouts of play and the bonds of those young and untested by time. But the echoes remain, a soft whisper in the heart of a city that never truly sleeps.",
            "Where is everything she asked. Her eyes wide as we drove past the cornfields stretching out to meet the sky. This is it I said. The sparseness of the land a shock to her senses. She lived in a place where the grocery store was a five-minute walk from her door and the sky was crowded with rooftops. Never seen such space this side of anywhere. I told her of the life in rural Ohio. How it was to rise and sleep under this open sky. And she came to know me then. The road a ribbon of gravel beneath us. Leading past a quarry filled with water like an old wound. The development where I lived just beyond. The houses standing in their brick and stucco silence. Each with half an acre or more to its name. Tended with a pride as old as the land itself. In the springtime the flowers rise like a promise kept. The midwestern trees shedding their leaves in a slow dance through the seasons. The driveways filled with cars polished to a shine. Mercedes Benz gleaming under the sun’s eye. Onward we drove toward my home. Grey stucco against the wide sky. My Korean neighbor always out with a smile. Mowing the grass or singing over the mower's hum. His laughter a part of the air we breathed. Once a doctor they say. Now blending with the grass and his John Deere. Age taking its toll but not his spirit. And there my home. Geese in the side yard scattered by the Terrier's chase. A stream out back feeding into the quarry. Bullfrogs croaking low and deep. The stream murmuring its secrets. The moo of distant cattle carried on the wind. Across a bridge of wood handmade and worn lies an oasis untouched. Trees and herbs and wildflowers growing as they will. This was my childhood's haunt. A place of forts and wild hunts of chasing nothing but shadows and dreams. Winters came hard and sharp. The land stripped bare but for its beauty. Branches skeletal against the sky. Snowfall turning the world to white overnight. Angels of snow lining the yard. My sister's handiwork. Snowmen standing guard in their silence. We fought my sister and I. Snowballs our chosen arms. Forts built of snow and branches our bastions. In this world nothing else mattered. We were children then. Untethered and free."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies a place carved out by the hand of time, a small town in Michigan where the land stretches from fields of toil to the quiet hum of tourist havens. A place far removed from the sprawling embrace of city malls, where no Wal-mart or Target casts its fluorescent glow, and the name Applebee’s is but a whisper carried on the wind. To reach any destination requires the journey of wheels, yet in this pocket of the world, beauty unfurls in a tapestry of water and sky. Here, the city is cradled by the arms of Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other, each offering the solace of shores where the weary can rest their feet in the cool embrace of sand.\n\nThe neighborhood echoes the song of small town life, where houses stand apart like solitary guardians, each with its own tale to tell. They are not the mirrored dreams of suburban sprawl, but homes of age and character, some bearing the marks of renewal, others holding fast to their roots. Basements lie beneath them, seen from the road, while aluminum siding speaks of years gone by. The spectrum of homes is a kaleidoscope of hues, each standing in testament to the spirit of Middle America, where labor is the currency of life, and families weave their stories in the fabric of days.\n\nChildren roam the streets with laughter in their wake, while dogs lead their masters on journeys of discovery. The rhythm of wheels on pavement sings of bikes and rollerblades tracing the paths between neighbors. Here, faces are familiar, and the bond of community is a gentle thing. A wave to the one grilling in the yard or a smile to the lone wanderer with their dog is the language of belonging. Lawns are tended with the care of stewards, leaves banished to the memory of autumn. Grass is kept in check, and gardens flourish in their quiet rebellion against the march of time.\n\nThis is not the kind of place that dazzles the eye with grandeur, but rather one that whispers of home in the language of peace and safety. It is a place where the soul finds its haven at day’s end. Nearby, the county sheriff’s department stands watch, and the health department offers its hand. The city’s recycling center hums with purpose, serving all who seek its aid. Baseball fields echo with the calls of announcers, names of players carried on the breeze. The small town airport lies beyond, a place where the sky is alive with the rumble of engines, marking the passage of time in the rhythm of flight.\n\nIce cream awaits the wanderer’s step, a sweet reward for the journey downtown. Parks lie within reach, a mere eight blocks from home, where children can ride their bikes and dreams take flight. This is a place where the heart finds its rest, where life moves at the pace of a gentle walk, and the world is a tapestry of the ordinary made extraordinary.",
            "The place where I make my home is like an endless sea of sameness, a sprawling suburbia carved from the earth in neat rows and parcels, each a mirror reflection of the next. A place where the hand of the homeowner's association has pressed firm upon the land. As you enter, it's a tableau of single-story houses, each kept with a precision that might seem unnatural were it not the edict of the association. The lawns are small and manicured, the grass trimmed and bordered by stones, the driveways short. There are trees, but they stand like sentinels, spaced deliberately and at intervals decided by those who rule this place. Every home has its double garage, a place for the vehicles that ferry their owners to the larger world beyond.\n\nThe roads are new-laid, a smooth expanse of concrete unmarred by time or weather, for there are no potholes to mar the journey here. The houses, mostly low and sprawling, sometimes rise to a second story, but not often. And the mailboxes speak of a collective mind, grouped together at the street's end like the mail slots of an apartment complex, keys granting access to their secrets.\n\nMy house lies on the city's fringe, where suburb meets the wild land beyond. It's a place with space enough for all things, where community pools shimmer behind their gates, kept clean and welcoming. Trails wind through the place for those who wish to walk alone or with a dog at their side, the paths leading nowhere and everywhere. There's no need for a park; the neighborhood's vastness provides.\n\nThe people here are mostly those who have laid down their burdens, the retirees who watch the world with gentle eyes, ensuring the safety of all. Among them are a few who still carry the weight of work, the middle-aged and the young, though they are outnumbered.\n\nThe city near us is large by the count of souls within it but small in its heart. It holds the things one needs, the mall that serves its purpose without excess. It takes a drive to reach the places of commerce, a fifteen-minute journey to the stores that line the streets, offering goods from the organic to the ordinary. A place where all things can be found if one knows where to look.\n\nThis is the neighborhood I call home. A place safe and tended, with its amenities and its ordered ways. A place where the world waits just beyond the horizon, a car ride away, ready to be embraced when needed.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place it was a voice on a podcast. A voice speaking of those who vanished as if swallowed whole by the earth. It was a strange thing to hear about a spot where every flat and lodging fetched thousandfold a month. None had spoken of it before. Not my friends nor the whispers in the streets. Perhaps it's the struggle. I know friends who shed tears into the night, alone in their rooms. The cost of things weighs heavy but we've learned the ways of thrift. The dusty scent of flea market relics and mothballed garments has become familiar. In adulthood, you breathe less deep of the world. Perhaps you take up smoking or perhaps you simply grow used to the state of things. Yet the flea market lingers in your senses. The scent of grown years is dusty pages stacked high on a forgotten piano. It seeps into the leather, defies the wash. In this place, three thrift stores are but a stone's throw. Start at one end and you find charity shops, a library, a rare book haven, and a store of curiosities. Downtown thrums with the pulse of cars and people in the morning but within the thrift's walls, all is silence. A refuge for lost hours. The city swells each year, spilling over with life. They call it a place of growth, headquarters to a sprawling empire of commerce and delivery, still raw with the pangs of its own becoming. It brings to mind New York, where each soul pursues their own course and little is asked of you. Here you can be alone and unseen, free of inquiry. Not as in the South where care is shown in its asking. Here you keep your own counsel as long as you will, the city itself receding like the tide upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound. The pianist next door, the singers above. A community in the guise of strangers. We share in our needs, mark the passage of life and death, lend aid where we can. In this, I'm fortunate. I find kinship with my neighbors and they with me. I clean my space and leave food and they do likewise. We trade letters and greetings. They are a light in the sprawl of this vast and cold city. It is through them I find that perhaps I have not lost my life entirely.",
            "In the heart of the Midwest, a town sits quietly, a whisper away from the sprawling suburbs of the city. It is a place marked by the weight of its own history, where the east side bears the scars of hardship etched into the very bones of the earth. Houses lean with the years, inhabited by those who tread the hard margin of life, their walls a testament to endurance. Yet, the streets speak a softer truth, lined with folk who nod and greet as one passes by, faces that carry stories of their own. Crime casts a shadow, yes, but it is a shadow familiar and not all-consuming. It has touched us lightly, sparing our own though others have not been so fortunate. The neighbors next door know the hollow loss that violence brings, their son taken from them outside a bar, the echo of gunfire a reminder of life's fragility.\n\nThe opioid scourge has laid its heavy hand upon us, fentanyl taking its toll, and the town mourns with a collective sigh. But as with all things, there is resistance. Places of healing dot the town, and the people arm themselves with knowledge and Narcan, standing vigil against the tide. Beneath these struggles lie gems of hope. My son's school stands as a bastion of light, where kindness is not a rarity and all children are given their due, a place where he has found acceptance despite the world’s indifference. The school feeds its young, ensuring no child knows hunger, and the community gathers to bolster one another, to lift as they climb.\n\nThe town's council has turned its gaze to the heart of the town, roads smoothed and parks renewed, though our eastern edge remains rough-hewn and raw, a point of quiet contention among us. Still, there is a fondness here, a quiet satisfaction in the familiarity of these streets, in the unassuming nature of life as it unfolds. Shops, both humble and grand, meet our needs, and though our home may not boast wealth, it holds comfort and memory in its walls. Sixteen years we have called this place ours, and the thought of elsewhere seems a distant dream, for here, amid the struggle and the grace, we have found our home.",
            "The neighborhood sits atop a hill, folding its arms around the stories of old stones and timeworn theaters. I dwell in a seven-story edifice, a sentinel across from the ancient playhouse, while the arcade bar at the foot of The Hill hums with the clamor of diverse souls drawn like moths to the summer’s glow. June and July birth queues that snake along the street, the people lined like pilgrims awaiting entry to some sacred rite. A few blocks up, the city park sprawls, a green lung amid the concrete, its grandeur unexpected in this quarter of the town. Encircling it, the cement holds fast, stairs carved into its flesh like the scars of battles past. Winter’s breath sets the homeless to their labor, erecting tents in regimented rows along the sidewalk, a testament to survival against the merciless rain that hammers down in the heart of the season. They cluster close, defying the chill, clinging to the warmth of the city’s core, the family center their beacon—a place to cleanse the grit from their bodies.\n\nYet it is the people, not the stones, that hold my heart. For Hilltop’s fame was once darkened by the shadow of gang wars, whispers still echoing of federal sweeps that sought to scour the streets clean. The tales endure, passed from father to son, mother to daughter, even to newcomers like myself. The folk labor with fervor, though the world may label their home a den of danger. They cherish their streets, their stories. They warn the pale faces to steer clear when night drapes its cloak, a caution rooted in days gone by, its taste bitter from the draught of prejudice. Perhaps I walk those streets, my skin a shade ambiguous, as one of them, marked not by color but by an understanding of the wounds that linger.\n\nThe Hilltop is an anchor. Its streets pulse with life, and in the dimming day, I find kinship among those who would offer a coat rather than seek to take from me. Here, laundromat doors stretch ajar a moment longer, granting refuge from the relentless rain, a place to breathe and charge the lifeline of a phone. Here, in the shadows, believing myself unseen, a stranger’s kindness alights upon me with a simple gift and the words of worth—reminders that even in a world splintered by ignorance and fear, there are pockets of grace, where humanity shines through the cracks.",
            "I came to this place with the ringing of the eighth grade in my ears, a time when the world seemed as vast as the sky and as distant. Friends were scarce at first, like shadows at dusk, but soon enough I found kinship in a boy from two doors down and another from further along the street. They've long since left, yet their spirits linger in the recesses of memory. The faces peering out from behind curtains remain much the same as when I first arrived. This neighborhood is the likeness of a thousand others, steeped in the cadence of suburbia. Houses rise in two-story uniformity, standing sentry over the quietude. On warm days, the air fills with the laughter of children, a chorus against the stillness of the week. Here, no quarrel has found me, and solitude is respected unless aid is sought. Packages come and go from my porch, untouched by the world's grasping hands, a testament to trust unbroken. Just beyond the reach of my doorstep lies a park, a mere heartbeat away, where memories are etched in sand and sweat. There, the games of youth were played—basketball, football, baseball—all amid the camaraderie of familiar faces. Yet it was there too, beneath the indifferent gaze of the sky, that pain found me in the form of an elbow to the nose. But such is life, where joy eclipses sorrow. Now, the park is a place of nostalgia, its swings and slides the stage for my cousin's children, their laughter a balm to old wounds. The mere thought of it stirs a longing for that which is past. Diversity blooms in this place, a tapestry of flavors within a stone's throw—Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian—all vying for attention. Yet convenience has its price, as the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash draw people away from the heart of it all. Fast food reigns supreme, as ubiquitous as the suburban dream. The stores are plentiful, offering all that one might seek. Dry cleaners stand at the ready, while Walgreens and CVS face off across the street, and the Jewel-Osco stands sentinel, a Midwestern staple. Even among the aisles, diversity whispers its presence, with an Indian-owned store offering a taste of home or a ready-made escape. In sum, this place is a sanctuary in a world of discord. I read of the trials others face with their neighbors and find myself thankful for the peace that envelops me here, a quiet gratitude in a world gone mad.",
            "The college stands but a short walk from the place I lay my head, and for that I am given to a certain fondness for this quarter. The architecture is predominantly of the apartment sort, though there are establishments for eating and drinking that offer a modest diversion. One of these watering holes has taken on a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though the spirits and service are not without their merits. The folk here are, on the whole, agreeable. Young scholars or those of modest means, they find shelter in these affordable walls. Children are a common sight, their presence owed to the nearby school which sits within a stone's throw of my abode. Of my neighbors, I know little and wish for less. Their penchant for the herb has led to the management installing a device of fragrance at their threshold, which my companion and I find a curious sort of jest. The edifices here are aged in their appearance, though perhaps they've been tended to within. Along the way, new apartments have sprouted, though their making is suspect, a mirage of prosperity at a dear cost. A roadside eatery dispenses its fare on paper, warmed by the hum of microwaves, while a gas station stands opposite, whispered to be a place of ill employment. Yet, the city saw fit to mend the road, laying down a broad walk with stretches of green, lending a touch of grace to the surroundings. Trees enshroud my dwelling, their number diminished but still present in greater abundance than farther afield. Beyond my enclave lies another street, less favored by fortune, where the path is broken and the structures weary. Trees abound there too, perhaps to cloak the weathered facades. The specter of crime is not unknown here, the blame shared across the way and beyond. Yet, I find a certain contentment in this place. It suits my purse and offers what I need. The nearness of the university and the convenience of the buses grant me ease in my comings and goings.",
            "The neighborhood lay in a quiet cul-de-sac where the duplexes stood like sentinels, each painted a shade of yellow with white porches and roofs of green metal glinting under the sun. They seemed to be individual houses, scattered without much order, though their common paint betrayed their kinship. Friendships forged in the spaces between them, folks standing at unmarked driveways in the soft folds of evening, speaking low while children tangled with their toys or scratched pictures onto the sidewalks with chalk. It was a refuge from the yawning maw of the modern world, a place caught in amber where time slithered slowly. Fields and trees wrapped the neighborhood in a verdant embrace, under skies vast and blue, clouds like drifting ships.\n\nYet, the tranquility was brittle. The season carried the weight of storms, and last night the sirens wailed their grim warning. We sought shelter, I with my small dog clutched tightly, purse and pillows in hand, as the big dog howled alone in the living room, uneasy in the unnatural calm. The world outside was a drum of hail, the earth steaming where the stones met the hot ground. The temperature plummeted, ninety-two to seventy-five, the hail dissolving upon impact. The skies cleared, and rain fell with the sun's return, painting a double rainbow across the heavens. I fetched my camera, capturing the spectacle to share with those far and wide, though the streets held their silence still, the world encased in the aftermath of storm.\n\nIn time, the quiet broke, folks returning home, the neighborhood breathing life anew. Women called to their children as dinner simmered, and the air was thick with camaraderie. I, newly arrived from New Hampshire to this southern land, found comfort in the lilt of voices, the slow, rolling cadence of the Southern drawl. The home I made in this place mirrored its neighbors, two bedrooms and two baths, though inside, they were not as kin. Some apartments were narrow as a stream, others more generous, an odd puzzle of space.\n\nBeyond my door, the world unfurled. A field spread wide, beckoning with the promise of solitude, a pond lay beyond, still and dark, not for swimming but for contemplation. Deer moved like shadows, and the bullfrog sang his morning song, a basso profondo echoing through the dawn. It was a good place, forty minutes from the city yet a world away, where roosters heralded the break of day and a donkey's bray marked the dusk. I found a haven here, a small community unto itself, a fortunate find amid the vast sprawl of the world.",
            "In the ten years since I came to this place, I reckon I've seen a thing or two worth telling. When I left Riverdale for Stockbridge, it was like stepping into a different world. I remember the tears, the way I cried for the life I left behind, the people I loved. But my folks, they had their reasons. They wanted more for me and my sister, a place where the houses were better, the schools better, a place that was not what folks called ghetto.  \n\nTime passed and the place grew on me. Made friends, made enemies too, as one does in those halls of learning. The neighbors mostly remained distant, shadows in the periphery, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis too, who lived just over the way. They became like kin to me in a manner of speaking, and I held them dear. There was a time when my family and I went to see Mr. Glen tie the knot anew. A wedding it was, a grand affair, full of laughter and dance. I caught the garter but missed the flowers as they sailed through the air. And we danced, oh how we danced, with Marsharii, his daughter, though she's gone her own way now. I hope the world has been kind to her.  \n\nThe neighborhood, it’s a tangle of streets and paths, a maze that I’ve come to know, mostly by the grace of a GPS, exploring when time allows. My friends Kason and Curtis, we’d wander those streets, lost in the joy of video games and the freedom of youth. Some days I’d find solace in the park, the quiet of nature soothing the soul. There, with sticks from the depot, I’d test my balance, wield my wooden sword, a bokken, in simple play.  \n\nA court for basketball, another for tennis, though I haven't picked up a racket in years. My dad, he taught me and my best friend the ways of tennis with Mr. Graves. They pushed us hard, but there was joy in it, a simple pleasure. This place, it holds memories, stories etched in the fabric of time. Yet I feel the best is yet to come, waiting just over the horizon.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a humble town where time seems to linger and the sun casts long shadows over fields of ripening peaches. Johnston they call it, with a sign at the edge of town proclaiming its pride as the Peach Capital of the World. It is a place of quiet industry, where the land whispers tales of toil and harvest, and the people move with the rhythm of seasons. Farmland stretches out like a tapestry woven with peach trees and cattle, the houses set back from the road, two stories tall with roofs of metal or gray shingles to withstand the summer’s relentless blaze.\n\nWithin the town’s core, a solitary stoplight dangles at a crossroads, marking the hub of commerce where the only stores congregate. There’s Hong Kong, a small Chinese eatery run by a family whose roots intertwine with the town’s soil. Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, where the air is thick with the scent of cumin and chili, and Gary's, serving burgers with a side of nostalgia. The pizzeria that once stood has fallen silent, its ovens cold. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a modest pharmacy, is famed not for its medicine but for its sweet elixir of Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, stands as the lone outpost for provisions, though many journey to Batesburg-Leesville’s Walmart for their weekly sustenance.\n\nDollar General is where the town’s pulse quickens, its aisles a refuge for all manner of need. Across the way, a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, is tended by a woman who knows all who pass through her door. Her goods are delivered by two faithful movers, known throughout Johnston. Next to her domain, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures, offering a menagerie of services from grooming to boarding.\n\nOn the outskirts, a doctor and a vet tend to the bodies and beasts of Johnston, their practice small but sufficient. The children learn their letters at Johnston Elementary, moving on to distant halls for the schooling of their teenage years. Parks are absent, yet the town dreams of a 2.5-acre haven for families to wander and play, a beacon to draw new souls to its fold.\n\nIn truth, Johnston offers little in the way of diversion. No screens flicker in darkened theaters, no pins tumble in alleys of polished wood. Yet it is a place of quiet charm, a town so slight you might pass it by without a second glance, though its memory lingers like the sweet scent of peaches on a summer breeze.",
            "In the small southern town where I make my home, there is a street threading like a quiet stream between two state highways. A place of passage, yes, with a fretful tally of traffic more than the heart might ask for. Yet beyond that, it's a neighborhood of stillness, where folks have settled into their lives as a hand fits a glove. The faces here have grown familiar, etched into the days like the slow erosion of stone, and each morning is greeted by the customary hum of chores as if the world itself were wound to that rhythm. In the colder months, there is the hill on the side street where children gather, their laughter the only sound against the hush of winter’s breath. Our house sits sentinel at the corner, eyes watching the comings and goings, always knowing the shape and color of the cars that pass. We note those which are strange to us, those that do not belong, as one marks the passage of a cloud.\n\nThe neighbors, they walk their dogs or themselves, and children ride their bikes, weaving through the tapestry of the street. Ours is a home tethered to the land, for we work from it, my wife and I, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen, each day finding us in and out, part of the neighborhood’s pulse. Sometimes, in defiance of the rain, we step outside to play beneath the heavy, gray sky. The grill on the back deck sends its scent upon the air, the smoke of meat and char an offering to the quiet gods of the street. There is the constant whirr of lawnmowers, a hymn of the grass, from March until October’s end when the earth grows weary of its growing. Trees stand as sentinels, remnants of the wood that once was, offering shade and in the fall, a cascade of leaves to be raked and burned, their smoke a harbinger of the season’s turning. Our winters have grown soft, more akin to a protracted autumn, and the front door remains mostly unused, the garage at the back our favored portal.\n\nDays of celebration are hushed affairs. Thanksgiving brings a scattering of unfamiliar cars, kin from distant places come to visit, their presence like a brief flicker of light. It is much the same for Christmas and Mother’s Day. In the quietude of this place, I find a contentment that is near to perfect. If only the road did not draw so many travelers, it might be a haven unmarred.",
            "In the heart of the high desert where the earth lies bare and endless, a land of dirt and dust and more dirt still, my neighborhood sits unassumingly. To live here is to know the unyielding presence of brown, a relentless hue that swallows the horizon. A patch of green here is an extravagance, a testament to the fortune spent on coaxing life from this arid soil. In the nineties, this place stretched wide and sparse, the houses scattered like seeds flung by some careless hand. Now, the city creeps closer, a slow encroachment of concrete and glass, a march toward some inevitable urban sprawl. Yet the soul of the desert remains, unbroken and vast. \n\nThe folks here, mostly, are kind as desert folk tend to be, though like any city, it has its shadows. I live among the old ones, their faces worn by sun and time, and it is a comforting place. The shops are those you'd expect, chains familiar to any traveler, but for finer things, one must venture beyond. Whole Foods and its ilk are strangers here, the city not yet ripe for such indulgence. Construction is the blood of this place, the promise of growth in the wide-open spaces. It is a thought that sits uneasy with me, for I left the rush of city life and have no desire to return to it. My work is in this field, shaping homes from drywall and T-bar, a craft that ties me to the earth here.\n\nWhat I cherish, though, are the creatures that call this land home. The desert, in its stark beauty, harbors life that thrives against the odds. In knowing these non-human neighbors, we find a way to live in harmony. My children, wild with curiosity, chase lizards and desert bugs, their laughter echoing in the dry air as they hunt their tiny prizes. \n\nThere are wonders here for those who seek them. Victorville offers a taste of desert life, a different kind of beauty that takes hold slowly. The annual San Bernardino County Fair is a gathering of joy and tradition, a celebration of this place we call home. Nearby, the mountains of Wrightwood rise, their snowy peaks a contrast to the desert below, offering lessons in winter's sports. And for those drawn to the stories of old, the Victor Valley Museum stands, a keeper of tales told in stone and bone, in the artifacts of those who walked this land before us.\n\nIn this desert, the days stretch long and the nights whisper with the voices of the past. It is a place where time slips by like sand through fingers, where one can find both solitude and kinship. And in the quiet moments, when the wind stirs the dust and the sun sinks low, I am reminded of the simple truth: this land, for all its harshness, is home.",
            "In the place I call my own, where the paths wind through halls of learning and the sun spills its light on the old stones of the campus, there lies a neighborhood not bound by picket fences or streetlamps but by the souls who wander its spaces. This place where I dwell is a college, its sprawling grounds a patchwork of lives intertwined. Here, the dormitory walls cradle those I call my own. We, the dwellers of this academic realm, are a peculiar kind of kin. \n\nThe houses of this place are not houses in the usual sense. There are the tall dormitories rising like sentinels in the dusk, rooms stacked high where two to a room live and dream and learn. In their shadow lie apartments, smaller and more private, where the elder students find refuge. Two floors they rise, and within each, the buzz of twenty souls at least. Beyond these, scattered like leaves in the wind, are houses for those who belong to the school in other ways. Alumni mostly, and they are few, for their kind is less common here.\n\nThe heart of this neighborhood beats with a diversity unmatched. People of all creeds and colors, those who have come from afar and those born close, all find their place. The staff, keepers of knowledge, dwell in the houses, while the new students fill the dorms and the seasoned ones take the apartments.\n\nShops and stores, they line the paths, catering to every need, each a world within walls. A park lies at the edge, a sanctuary for the weary and the wanderers. It is a ground kept clean by those who tread it, a haven from the pressures of the world. This is my neighborhood, a tapestry of lives woven together, where every soul finds its place in the grand design.",
            "There are no sidewalks in the place where I live. The world slopes away from my door and the house sits perched on the crest of a hill that folks call the workout hill for the joggers who labor up its incline each day. Without a path to guide them, they walk the blacktop road, pitted and worn, hazardous in its way. The wires that snake around the block hang in tatters, victims of the storms that rage through, laying waste to trees and lines, the repairs a patchwork testament to the fury of the elements. Tall evergreens stand sentinel, but they're not welcome here. They fall beneath the axe, for they block the view of the ocean, the houses built high, glass-fronted and looming, each a witness to the bay's beauty. Come sunset, the waters catch fire beneath the sky's orange glow, though more often clouds shroud the sun, leaving the light to filter through a haze. The days are overcast and damp, moss creeping over all it touches, roofs and cars and railings turned green in its embrace. I left my car out for a month, and it was swallowed by the moss, three hours of scraping to reclaim it. Children are few, though a school lies near, the neighborhood mostly the domain of the old, retirees who have traded children for dogs. They roam the lawns and race the streets, slipping through open doors to claim the warmth of a stranger's home. I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it back into the world it knew. Rabbits run wild here, bold and burrowing, the gardeners' bane, yet beloved by my cats who have hunted them to near extinction. Birds flit and flutter, sparrows and hummingbirds, while hawks and eagles are driven off by the crows, protectors of this place. There are no stores to speak of, but the hike downhill leads to the waterfront where restaurants serve the sea's bounty. No beach lies there, only rocks to hurl into the bay, the opposite shore visible through the mist that clings to the days.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies the neighborhood of Bensonhurst, a place where the city hum persists, and the pulse of New York City is ever felt. To find this enclave is no chore, for the veins of public transit reach all through it, making the journey seamless and swift. The streets bear witness to the tides of change, for in the past decades, an influx of Asian souls has woven a new tapestry upon this urban fabric. As you wander, the signs of their presence are unmistakable, each block adorned with Asian-owned stores—their neon signs casting a glow in the evening haze, supermarkets and laundromats thriving where once were others. Here, the food is fresh, the prices fair, and the convenience a balm for the hurried heart of the city dweller. Four such markets stand within mere steps of one another, a testament to the world's smallness.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not solely the domain of one people. It is a mosaic, a patchwork of lives and stories, immigrants and their progeny, each contributing to the hum of life that fills the air. The echoes of their voices and the rhythm of their lives are woven into the very fabric of this place.\n\nNearby, a park stands renewed, a sanctuary of sorts amidst the city sprawl. There, courts for basketball and handball, fields for soccer and baseball, await those in search of play. Children’s laughter rings out from the playground, and in summer, water fountains offer their cooling embrace. Here too, the diversity of the city is reflected in the faces of those who gather, united in the spirit of sport and leisure.\n\nThe skyline of Bensonhurst is not punctuated by the towers of commerce, but by the more humble abodes of co-ops and condominiums, where families find their homes. The streets are lined with the low houses of two families, and the air is filled with the sound of life. Cars pass by, their music a rolling soundtrack, and engines roar to greet the dawn.\n\nWhen night falls, a cloak of caution is advised. Though the streets are mostly safe, the shadows can conceal those who mean harm. Memories linger of past encounters, specters of bullies and thieves who once roamed these streets. Packages, left unguarded, are known to vanish, spirited away by unseen hands. And then, there is the matter of the dogs, whose owners heed not the city's edicts. The pavements bear witness to their neglect, and each step must be taken with care, lest one's shoes bear the mark of their oversight.\n\nSo, tread carefully and keep your eyes open, for Bensonhurst is a place where the past and present converge, where the city's heartbeat is strong, and the stories of its people are written anew each day.",
            "In the city of Portland, Oregon, there is a saying painted on the back of a building that hosts a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, and perhaps more than it should by law. Keep Portland Weird, it reads. And what is this weirdness they speak of? For some, it is a whisper from a time when the city was not so well known, nor so expensive, when the streets bred a different kind of life, creative and wild. A time before the influx of those from the south, before the skyscrapers of concrete and glass rose to greet the clouds. For others, it is a call to arms, an invitation to a city where the odd is embraced, where peculiar is but a shade of charm.\n\nDespite the coming of the new, the affluent, the ever-rising walls of condominiums, Portland clings to this strangeness. It does not mean all is welcome, but it does mean there is room for what elsewhere might be pushed away. This city does not turn from the modern world, nor the battles it brings. Portland buys its goods from distant lands just as the rest, and in its heart are a million ways to be strange, to walk a path not marked by the footsteps of others. Yet among this, there is normalcy. There is yoga and the hipsters and those who wear ties and carry briefcases. Perhaps to be weird here is to wear these things with less weight, to let them slide from your shoulders.\n\nIn the neighborhood where I find myself, the houses are painted in colors that seem plucked from a dream. The gardens are full of life, flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets as if they might spill over and cover the world. In the summer, one might find a free box sitting on a corner, a simple container with gifts inside, discarded by one and waiting for another. It might be cardboard or plastic, but inside is the magic of the unexpected, a treasure waiting for the right eyes to see it. Clothes, books, anything at all might lie within.\n\nThis is the heart of Portland for me, and I am but one among the myriad. There are those who would never dream of taking what they wear from a box on the street. They might find their joy in yoga with goats or in cheering for the Timbers, the city's proud soccer team. Portland is a place where hearts beat for a thousand different things. A place where dreams are chased or left to linger in the dim light of a bar.\n\nThere is darkness here too. A problem with drugs that is perhaps a shadow of the mind's own struggles. The rain falls heavy and long, the clouds like a shroud, and they say it weighs upon the soul. There are those without homes, drawn by the promise of help that is better than most but not enough. And those who have homes are torn between compassion and disdain. In this, perhaps, there is nothing strange at all.",
            "The mountains stood steadfast in the north, sentinels of the sun’s passage, day after day, night after night. They watched with an ancient patience, unyielding as the earth itself. In the clamor of daily life, in the grind of tasks and trials, they were there, silent and solemn. And when those days came, when the world seemed a weight unbearable, they compelled my gaze. They let me lay my weary spirit upon their shoulders, lending strength to carry just one more day. I came to this place when my journey of learning began, drawn by the northern peaks that loomed over the campus. The university had its own beauty, in the form of grand facades and tranquil ponds, trees that whispered secrets to the wind. Yet it was the mountains that held dominion over my heart. The town sprawled out, beautiful in its own right, with cafés that cradled the hours of caffeine-fueled toil. A brief walk or a bus ride brought one to the heart of downtown, where the bricks, faded and weary, whispered tales of a time gone by. Here, this suburban town took on the guise of an urban sprawl, bustling with life, yet the clamor faded quickly as one passed the library, retreating once more into the quietude of small-town life. This juxtaposition of worlds, so close and yet so distinct, gave the city a wonder that called out to be known. Memories were born here, each tied to a place—a stroll past rusted swings after a night without sleep, a mad dash through the bustling streets to a theater where the university gifted glimpses of art. And yet, as all places are, it was a canvas for life’s harsher strokes. The ponds, those mirrors to the sky, served both as places of contemplation and as refuges for tears shed in the depths of night’s despair. I knew those nights well. Watching the turtles and ducks, the dance of insects upon the water, I pondered my place in this great tapestry, my purpose amid the endless enigma of existence. And so I walked, past the ponds, past the parks, past the quiet cries of suburban homes, until I found myself upon a main street. The sun, in its ascent, cast its light upon the palms, painting the heavens with hues of dawn. I looked up then, and saw I was moving north. There they were, as they had always been, the mountains touching the sky with their towering grace. And as if speaking in silence, they stirred within me a resolve to endure.",
            "You might pass it by without a second thought, for it lies behind the faded facades of commerce, where few would think to find a place called home. But there it is, behind the derelict Whole Foods, past the transient hotels that only stir with life in the warmth of summer reunions. Here, a hidden township hums with its own life. Streets lined with apartments, each complex nestled like Russian dolls, meticulously disassembled and aligned down the crooked lane. The first cluster is known for its tales of misdeeds, whispered about on late-night news, yet we shall not linger there. For beyond lies another realm unknown to most who tread the mundane paths of this land.\n\nAcross the way stands the satellite campus of a modest college, its silent buildings standing guard. Students trickle in with the early light, coffee in hand, eyes heavy with the weight of morning. Iron gates creak and groan, admitting them one by one, while the impatient chorus of commuters rises—a symphony of honking horns and muttered curses at delayed passage. The road leads to another, where a park and a center for mending broken bodies coexist. The center, with its cheerful veranda, watches the world turn, a lazy fan stirring the thick air of summer. Children tumble across the green, their joy a sharp contrast to the bees that drift lazily among the wildflowers.\n\nOld souls shuffle along the path with their canine companions, casting disapproving glances at the youth on their wheeled boards, yet offering nods to the girls who gather, whispering of love and fleeting fame. Nearby, a strip mall stands—a sushi joint with its modest fare, a pool supply store, and a nail salon sandwiched between. Here, one could prepare for summer, indulge in a manicure, and savor hibachi all in a single breath. A frozen yogurt shop sits within, where the young often seek reprieve from the sun, clutching dripping cups as they skate and puff on their devices, convinced of their own coolness.\n\nThis neighborhood is but a slice of the old America, a relic in the languid south where time moves as slow as the syrupy air, and change is a stranger seldom seen.",
            "In the neighborhood where I live, the old houses hunker down like weathered sentinels of another time. Most stand alone, single-family dwellings, but here and there a house has been split, conjoined like some forlorn conjoined twin. My home sits with its small yard out front and a narrow driveway to the side, and it whispers of a past when this suburbia was the heart of an American dream that now drifts like smoke, elusive and distant. Yet the streets still echo with the remnants of that dream, holding on with a quiet resilience, beckoning those who pass through to remember. The people here, their optimism faded like the paint on their weather-beaten homes, tend the little yards with a lesser care, and yet the driveways still cradle a car or two. Children play in the streets, their laughter bright against the backdrop of a world that feels like all there is.\n\nThe schoolhouse, standing sentinel for near ninety years, seems to spin futures from the dust of nostalgia, binding the youth to a history the elders recall with a fond ache. Churches dot the landscape like forgotten relics, their pews empty, while the basketball courts pulse with life. Each house wears a different face, yet the spirit within feels kindred. A supermarket, Super “A,” is run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the lone Arab souls among the largely African American residents who weave the tapestry of this place. Wide streets stretch out, where kids dash after footballs, pausing only as cars inch past, a dance of youth and steel.\n\nGenerations have sunk roots here, and each resident seems to carry stories of a time when everyone knew everyone else. There was a karate school once, but with the passing of the karate kid dreams, it gave way to a pharmacy, where remedies of another kind are dispensed. A little movie theater, offering old films at a price that spares few, is a sanctuary for the elders who relish a night away from the youthful clamor. An expressway cuts through, though its exits and entrances lie just beyond our reach, a contested line where the elders’ wisdom ruled over the young’s desire for connection.\n\nA new high school rises, and in its shadow, we ponder what symbol might capture the spirit of this town. I think a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin might just fit the mold of this place, a fusion of past and future, as absurd as it is fitting.",
            "In the vast sprawl of the city where I make my home, the streets wind through a mosaic of life and commerce. Here, the neighborhoods unfurl like patches on an old quilt, stitched together by the invisible hands of time and circumstance. The shops and eateries, places of human gathering and solitude alike, stand scattered among the dwellings as if cast there by the whims of some ancient god. You find the grand facades of corporate empires shoulder to shoulder with humble boutiques, their windows a testament to the timeless dance of ambition and dream. The streets are alive with the tread of those seeking the new, the novel, and the familiar comforts of the old. Yet alongside these bustling avenues, quiet parks lay nestled—a refuge for the laughter of children and the soft murmur of leaves.\n\nIn this tapestry of urban life, the people are as varied as the stars in a cold, clear night. A place where the colors of the world blend and stand apart, a testament to humanity's ceaseless migration and settlement. Here lives a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, there the solemn presence of Orthodox Jewry, and the echoes of the old Soviet lands in the voices of newcomers. Beyond the borders of my own corner of the city, the world expands with neighborhoods named for far places, Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—each a world within a world, where the old ways are not forgotten, nor entirely remembered.\n\nBut to traverse these distances, even the briefest of miles, is to wrestle with the ceaseless tide of traffic. The city's arteries clogged with metal and rubber, each movement a test of patience. Few take to the streets on foot, for the city is a vast, sprawling beast, and her distances are not for the faint of heart. Yet the city grows, relentless as the tide, new buildings rising from its depths, promising sanctuary and promise, but to many, only the specter of more and more and more.\n\nAnd so, the city harbors its multitude of abodes, from the grand towers reaching skyward to the low, humble homes nestled in their shadows. There are those who seek the solitude of their own plot of earth, others content with the company of neighbors above and below. Each street, each house, a story. My own neighborhood, a crossroads of ages and stories, where each face is a mystery, each life a narrative unwritten to my eyes. It is not the place of my childhood, where the streets rang with the shouts of play and the bonds of those young and untested by time. But the echoes remain, a soft whisper in the heart of a city that never truly sleeps.",
            "Where is everything she asked. Her eyes wide as we drove past the cornfields stretching out to meet the sky. This is it I said. The sparseness of the land a shock to her senses. She lived in a place where the grocery store was a five-minute walk from her door and the sky was crowded with rooftops. Never seen such space this side of anywhere. I told her of the life in rural Ohio. How it was to rise and sleep under this open sky. And she came to know me then. The road a ribbon of gravel beneath us. Leading past a quarry filled with water like an old wound. The development where I lived just beyond. The houses standing in their brick and stucco silence. Each with half an acre or more to its name. Tended with a pride as old as the land itself. In the springtime the flowers rise like a promise kept. The midwestern trees shedding their leaves in a slow dance through the seasons. The driveways filled with cars polished to a shine. Mercedes Benz gleaming under the sun’s eye. Onward we drove toward my home. Grey stucco against the wide sky. My Korean neighbor always out with a smile. Mowing the grass or singing over the mower's hum. His laughter a part of the air we breathed. Once a doctor they say. Now blending with the grass and his John Deere. Age taking its toll but not his spirit. And there my home. Geese in the side yard scattered by the Terrier's chase. A stream out back feeding into the quarry. Bullfrogs croaking low and deep. The stream murmuring its secrets. The moo of distant cattle carried on the wind. Across a bridge of wood handmade and worn lies an oasis untouched. Trees and herbs and wildflowers growing as they will. This was my childhood's haunt. A place of forts and wild hunts of chasing nothing but shadows and dreams. Winters came hard and sharp. The land stripped bare but for its beauty. Branches skeletal against the sky. Snowfall turning the world to white overnight. Angels of snow lining the yard. My sister's handiwork. Snowmen standing guard in their silence. We fought my sister and I. Snowballs our chosen arms. Forts built of snow and branches our bastions. In this world nothing else mattered. We were children then. Untethered and free."
