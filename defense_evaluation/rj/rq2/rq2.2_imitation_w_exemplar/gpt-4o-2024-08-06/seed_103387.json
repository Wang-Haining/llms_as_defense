            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies my small town in Michigan, where the old roads meander through farmland and spill into quaint tourist cities. There are no sprawling malls or neon-lit Walmarts, no Targets or even an Applebee’s to speak of. The places you might need lie far off, and travel is a necessity. Yet, despite this, I find myself amidst a beauty unparalleled, encircled by the waters that have cradled this land. My town, if it can be called so, is a peninsula gripped by the arms of Lake Michigan on one flank and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Shores abound where one might wander and feel the cool kiss of the lake upon their feet.\n\nThe neighborhood I call home breathes the essence of small-town life. Houses stand solitary, each with its own story, not replicas of one another, but elder structures, some renewed, others bearing the weight of years. Basements lie beneath, full and visible from the roads that wind by. Aluminum siding clings to many, weathered and strong, and the color of the homes is a patchwork quilt that encircles my own. Yards stretch out before them, where children play upon trampolines and swingsets, where gardens grow and fences keep watch over the creatures within. It is Middle America, a testament to the toils of those who live within its boundaries, raising their kin or having done so.\n\nThe streets are alive with the laughter of children, the steady rhythm of bikes and rollerblades, the soft pad of dogs led by their masters. Neighbors nod in recognition, aware of who belongs and who is a stranger. A wave from a grill, a smile from a passerby with their dog, are the currency of this place. Lawns are tended with care, green and trim, free from the decay of autumn leaves. Plants and bushes stand in neat array, pruned and orderly. It is not a neighborhood that daunts with grandeur but one that whispers of solace and family, of quiet and safety. It is an average place made exceptional by the promise it holds—a sanctuary at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s department keeps vigil, and the health department stands in its shadow. The city recycling center lies just beyond, a hub for the surrounding folk. Baseball and softball fields echo with the voices of announcers and the names of players, and beside them, a small-town airport sends its planes skyward, their engines a low rumble in the air. Ice cream is within reach, a sweet reward at the end of a walk, and downtown beckons from a distance. My children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away, a testament to the spirit of this place. It is a good place to call home.",
            "In the place where I call home, the landscape is a tapestry of sameness, each thread meticulously placed by the unseen hand of the homeowners' association. Upon crossing the threshold into this suburban sprawl, you are met with a parade of houses, each a mirror to the next, their facades pristine and unyielding. The lawns are kept in a neat patchwork of green, sprinkled with stones for ornament, and short driveways lead to garages built for two. Here and there, a tree stands sentinel, a modest testament to nature’s incursion.\n\nThe roads, freshly paved, snake through this enclave of the ordinary, unmarred by potholes or the scars of time, a testament to the diligence of those who see to such matters. The homes stand mostly single-storied, though some dare to reach higher, their windows like eyes watching the quiet streets. Gone are the solitary mailboxes that once marked each plot; in their stead, a cluster waits at the street’s end, keys clinking in locks as neighbors retrieve their mail and packages from the shared boxes—a nod to the unyielding quest for uniformity.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, this neighborhood is a strange blend of the rural and the suburban, sprawling across ample land. Community pools lie behind gates, inviting yet untroubled, while paths wind through the area, offering solace to those who walk their dogs or seek solitude in the fading light. Parks are unnecessary here; the neighborhood itself is vast enough for any runner’s ambition.\n\nRetirees make up the bulk of this community, eyes watching out for one another, bringing a sense of safety that wraps around you like a well-worn coat. But among them, younger faces emerge—professionals who have found a place here, amidst the quiet.\n\nThe city itself looms larger in number than in spirit, a place where the pulse of a small town beats beneath the skin of a bustling populace. There’s a mall, modest in its offerings but sufficient to the needs of those who wander through its halls. Fifteen minutes is the measure of the distance to the heart of commerce, where stores line the streets, each a promise of goods, from the finest organic markets to the stark shelves of discount outlets.\n\nThis neighborhood is a haven of safety and order, with pools to cool the heat of summer and trails that wind like thoughts through the terrain. And though the shops lie further afield, a short drive delivers you to the doors of any chain you desire, convenience a mere engine's purr away.",
            "I first learned of my dwelling through a podcast about the vanished. Surprising in its own right. This place where apartments fetch a thousand a month and yet tales of the lost lingered unknown. Neither I nor my friends knew of such stories. Perhaps it's the struggle. Some nights, friends weep themselves into restless sleep. The cost of living steep, yet frugality's been our teacher over the years. The scent of flea market relics and mothballed garments becomes familiar, almost comforting. The smells of adulthood, subdued in their presence, cling to you like a second skin. Smoking or simply accustomed, you find the flea market's essence undeniable. Dusty magazines on a silent piano. The scent burrows into leather, stubborn against washing. Here, three thrift stores lie within steps. Start at the far end, wander through charity thrifts, past a library, a rare book shop, and a store of curiosities. Downtown, dense with life, cars and people throng the streets, yet within the thrift's walls, silence prevails. The perfect refuge for an afternoon adrift. Each year, more souls flood the city. A city swelling under the weight of its own burgeoning empire. A place reminiscent of New York, where people pursue their own paths, seldom asking of you. Alone, a quiet independence respected. Not like the South, where curiosity signals care. Here, lives remain unprobed, shells intact as the city ebbs and flows like tides. A place alive, between the pianist next door and the singers above. Strangers in apartments become a community. Needs met, birthdays marked, funerals mourned, aid given. Fortunate to be here, neighbors kind and well-meaning. I return the favor, tidying after myself, sharing food. Mail exchanged. A pleasure to see them, and perhaps they think the same of me. In this vast, impersonal sprawl, it's the neighbors who make it feel less like ruin.",
            "In a small town nestled in the Midwest, there lies the edge of the world, just beyond the reach of the city where the sprawling suburbs give way to a more modest existence. The neighborhood where I dwell stands on the eastern fringe, marked by economic struggle and homes that wear the years in their sagging frames. Low the worth of these lands, where tenants and owners alike count their pennies, yet there is a beauty that resists the sum of its parts. The people who pass by offer a nod, a greeting, their faces lined with stories untold. \n\nCrime has its own dance here, a little more frequent than in other quarters, yet it does not overshadow the day. Tales of violence linger in the air, whispers of past years where blood was spilled not far from where I lay my head. Our next-door neighbors, they lost a son to the night outside a bar where shadows stretch long. But fortune has spared us the worst, our losses confined to what the porch could not guard.\n\nThe town itself bears the scars of a different war, the kind fought with needles and pills. The scourge of opioids, fentanyl a ghostly reaper, has claimed many souls. Yet even in this, there is a battle waged, with centers for healing and hands that train others to bring back the lost from the brink.\n\nAmidst these trials, light finds its way. My son attends a school where the halls hum with a kindness that shields him from life's cruelties. The teachers there, the staff, they are a beacon, and the boy thrives in their care. The community gathers, a PTO that breathes life into the year with events that bind us all together. In a town where poverty stalks one in five, the school offers its children meals freely, a stand against hunger. No child there feels the weight of what they cannot pay.\n\nThe city fathers have turned their gaze to the heart of the town, paving roads, tending to the green, yet the east where I dwell remains a shadow in their plans. The center thrives, the west bustles with commerce, but here on the eastern edge, we wait for the light to reach us.\n\nStill, this town is home. Its people, its schools, the shops that line its streets, they meet our needs. The house we call ours may not boast of wealth, but it holds comfort, and that is its own treasure. Sixteen years we have stood upon this soil, and in our hearts, there lies no desire to be elsewhere.",
            "In the heart of the city stands a neighborhood steeped in tales of its own, perched upon a hill and hemmed in by the memories of structures long past. I dwell in a seven-story apartment, a lone sentinel across from the old theater where once voices soared and stories unfurled. Down the slope, a block away, lies a curious haunt, an arcade bar, where souls converge in the sultry throes of summer nights. June and July see them in clusters, a line snaking along the pavement, each waiting for a moment inside. Not far, the city park sprawls wide, a rare expanse of green amid the urban sprawl. Concrete girds it and stairs run steep, carved into the earth like secrets kept. When winter's breath bites, the homeless come, pitching tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk, the wide steps their refuge. Snow is scarce, but the rain comes relentless, a deluge that chills bones and spirits alike. They huddle close, seeking warmth in the city's core, not far from the family center where solace might be found, a chance to wash away the grime of wandering. But it is not these things that bind me to this place. It is not the grandeur of the past, nor the elegance of architecture that graces the hillsides sloping to the sea. What I cherish is the spirit of the people, the tapestry of lives woven through Hilltop. Once, it was a name spoken in fear, a haven for violence that painted the West Coast red. Stories linger still, whispers of the DEA and federal might sweeping through like a cleansing wind. The people remember, passing tales from one generation to the next, even to newcomers like myself. They toil in earnest, striving to shed the past, to nurture their streets with care and pride. Some say it's unwise to walk Hilltop by night if you're white, a caution rooted in bygone days and the bitter tang of prejudice. Yet, perhaps I tread unnoticed, just dark enough to blend, or maybe Hilltop sees in me a kindred soul, one who knows the weight of history that bears down upon us all. In a city that should be a mosaic of cultures, the old wounds still fester. But the Hilltop is my heart. Walking those streets under the cloak of night, I find life there, a kinship with people more likely to offer a coat than ill intent. It's a place where laundromat lights linger longer for a phone to find power, where I've sat shrouded in the night’s chill, only to be seen, handed a token of humanity, and told I am beautiful and worth something.",
            "I came to this place on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world was as uncertain as the shadows cast by the old elms at dusk. It was not easy to find kin in those early days. Yet I found myself drawn close to a lad who dwelt two doors down and another who lived along the same winding street. Those boys are gone now, their laughter and companionship scattered to the winds, but the echoes of our time remain etched into the fabric of this place. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still here, their lives woven into the quiet tapestry of this American suburb.\n\nThe houses here stand two stories tall, their facades reflecting the sameness of the world in which they stand. On warm days, the voices of children thread through the air, a symphony of innocence and joy. But for the most part, silence reigns here, and I have never found cause for discord among these neighbors. Solitude is a gift in this place, until the hour comes when you seek the hands of others. Packages arrive at my door, untouched by the specter of theft, and I find a strange solace in this trust.\n\nA park lies a stone’s throw from my door, a realm of memories both cherished and unwelcome. There I have played games of sport, felt the sting of a wayward elbow upon my nose, yet the warmth of camaraderie overshadows such fleeting pain. Nowadays, when my feet tread that familiar ground, it is with my cousin’s young ones, their delight in the swings and slides a balm for nostalgia's ache.\n\nThis neighborhood is a patchwork of souls and stories, diverse as the flavors that linger in the air. Within a mile's stride, one finds the spices of China, India, Mexico, and Italy. Yet the folk here often summon their meals through the ether, with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash delivering sustenance to their doors. The fast-food joints hold sway, as they do in many suburbs, their lights a beacon of sameness. Yet there is variety to be found, even an Indian-owned store that beckons with promises of distant lands.\n\nThe shops here are a bounty of necessity and indulgence, from dry cleaners to pharmacies, and the Jewel-Osco, a staple of the Midwest. This place, with its quiet streets and whispers of wind, has become a refuge. Tales from the world beyond, tales of strife and neighborly woe, serve only to deepen my gratitude for the peace I find here.",
            "The world as I find it lies close by the college where I spend my days, and I take some solace in that fact. The landscape is dotted with apartment blocks and the occasional refuge of dining and drink, places that offer a modicum of diversion without too severe a toll on the pocket. A certain tavern recently took on a new name and with it a heftier price, though the spirits and service could be worse. Folks here are largely amiable. They are students or else of modest means, drawn by the low rents. Children abound, their laughter mingling with the breeze from the nearby school. I keep to my own and have no need for the company of neighbors. They indulge in the smoke that clouds the halls, prompting management to install an air freshener outside their door, an action that my companion and I find near comical in its futility. \n\nThe buildings carry the weight of years in their visage though some hide modern interiors. Down the way, new homes rise, hollow in construction yet dressed in high rents, a charade tolerated due to their nearness to the campus. A mere five minutes’ walk finds a cheap eatery where food, served on paper, emerges from the hum of microwaves. Across the street stands a gas station, its reputation as an employer poor. Yet, the city’s hand has touched the road, granting it a fresh face with wide sidewalks and green spaces, an attempt at grace amidst decay. My own dwelling is cushioned by trees, though some have fallen to the axe, leaving behind stumps, reminders of what once was. Behind the apartment lies another street, less cared for, its walkways crumbling, its buildings weary. Trees line the avenue, perhaps to veil the neglect beneath. \n\nCrime is whispered of, particularly from a complex down yonder, though it is not alone in such tales. Across from my own abode, shadows flit through a transient populace, but I find contentment here. It suits my purse, and the conveniences are many—the university a short walk, the buses ready to carry me to the market or into the heart of the town.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawled beneath the wide and endless sky, where duplexes stood in quiet formation along the cul-de-sac, each painted in the same sun-drenched yellow with white porches and roofs of green metal. They seemed to stand as solitary houses, scattered like memories of another time. In the evenings, we gather, a cluster of souls at the end of a driveway not marked by plan or intent, while children spin their worlds in colored chalk and kites that strain against the tethering earth. It is a breath of yesterday in a world too quickened by machines and screens. The fields stretch wide around us, wrapped in the arms of trees, the sky above a canvas of blue and cloud, and yet there is a shadow that leans upon the land.  \n\nIn this season, the air is thick with the threat of storms, and last night the sirens rose, their wail cutting through the stillness, driving us to shelter. I found myself ensconced in the narrow womb of the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, a purse, a few pillows. The large dog refused the sanctuary of the bathroom, pacing and barking in the living room, unsettled by the strangeness of the hour. Outside, the world was silent save for the hammer of hail upon the earth, the neighborhood hushed in anticipation.  \n\nWhen the storm had passed, the road was a river of steam, the heat of the day fleeing before the sudden coolness. The temperature had fallen like a stone, the hail melting as it met the hot ground. I looked up, and the sky was clearing, the sun breaking through to paint a double rainbow across the heavens. I ran inside, fetched my camera, capturing the moment to share with kin and friends far distant, their awe echoing my own.  \n\nThe streets remained still for a time, until the people returned from where they had sought refuge, the rhythm of life resuming its gentle cadence. Mothers and children emerged, the scent of cooking meals drifting on the air. It is a place of warmth and welcome to this stranger from the north, where the voices are wrapped in the soft music of the southern drawl.  \n\nMy dwelling is like all the others, two bedrooms, two baths, though within each lies its own secret, some small, some spacious, a mystery of design. I find solace in the great field behind, where a path winds to a pond not meant for swimming, a place where deer wander and the bullfrog sings his morning song. It is a sanctuary, just beyond the city's reach, where each dawn is heralded by the crow of roosters, the farms that border our small enclave. And in the evening, the bray of a donkey calls out from a nearby farm, a voice in the gathering dusk. This place, this hidden gem of a neighborhood, has offered me its quiet grace.",
            "In the ten years I've wandered this patch of earth, there's been a reckonin' of sorts within me. When first my feet set upon this ground, I was adrift in sorrow. Riverdale lay behind, its memory a shadow clinging close. My tears fell, for I left behind kin and land I loved. But my mama and papa sought a better place, a place where my sister and I could grow like saplings unbent by the wind, in a house they deemed fit for us, in a school unmarred by the ghetto's whisper. \n\nTime, that old relentless river, carried me forward. In its flow, I found companions and foes, both. Of the neighbors, I came to know but a few. Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis, they were all in the circle of my knowing. They've been a solace, almost kin, and for that, I hold them dear. I recall, clear as day, the time when we all went to see Mr. Glen wed anew. It was a day of lightness, a day to dream of for my own future, of a life wrought in gold for some bride to be. When Miss Veda cast her garter into the air, it was I who caught it, though the flowers escaped my grasp. We danced beneath the stars, and I took joy with Marsharii, his daughter, a fleeting presence whose path I hope has led to grander things.\n\nThe streets here wind like a labyrinth, though now with the guide of a GPS, I find time to wander. My feet have carried me as far as they dared with Kason and Curtis at my side. We, who spent our days lost in games and laughter, living each moment as if it were our last. The park calls to me often, a balm for my spirit, offering solace beneath its boughs. There, among the trees, I find my balance with sticks from the depot, wielding my bokken like a samurai of old.\n\nCourts for tennis and basketball stand silent, though they remember the sweat and toil of our games. My father, alongside Mr. Graves, taught us the ways of tennis, and in their training, we found joy. Yes, this place has held many moments of delight, tales etched in the fabric of my being. Yet still, I sense the horizon holds more, a promise of the best yet to unfurl.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies Johnston, a town that whispers its own tales. It's not a place that strikes one as distinct, yet it holds its ground in the world of agriculture. They call it the Peach Capital of the World, a claim that stands bold against the sky on the town’s sign. Fields stretch wide, a patchwork of peach trees and cattle pastures, the land breathing in the sun's relentless gaze. Houses, those not within the town's narrow heart, scatter themselves across the countryside. Some rise two stories high, capped with metal against the summer blaze or clad in gray shingles. They sit back from the road, granting the front fields to animals or crops as though in quiet homage to the land.\n\nIn the town's core, a lone stoplight sways above the crossroads, marking the hub of commerce. A triad of eateries offers solace to the hungry traveler: Hong Kong, a small Chinese enclave run by one family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary’s, a humble burger joint. The pizzeria shuttered its doors not long ago, leaving its absence to echo in the town’s memory. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family pharmacy, finds renown not for its pills but for the Cherry Coca-Cola that bubbles within its walls. Then there’s the IGA, a grocery store both small and dear, where shoppers pick up just a thing or two before heading to the Walmart yonder in Batesburg-Leesville.\n\nDollar General stands as the town's beacon, its shelves laden with the essentials of everyday life, bustling from dawn till dusk. Nearby, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a woman known to all, has stood for a generation. Two men work there, delivering sofas and tables to those who call the town home. Attached is Clark’s Cuts and Kennels, where pets are groomed and tended, their services a comfort to the residents.\n\nA doctor and a veterinarian offer their care on the outskirts, small practices but sufficient. Johnston Elementary holds the town's children until fifth grade, after which they venture to the next town for further schooling. There’s talk of a park, 2.5 acres of promise, where families might gather and outsiders be drawn. For now, the town offers no theaters, no alleys for bowling, no places for idle gathering. But in its quiet, Johnston holds a charm, fleeting as it may be, that lingers even as one passes through, perhaps without noticing at all.",
            "In the small southern town of Tennessee where I live, there's a street that runs between two state highways, drawing more traffic than one might hope for. The neighborhood otherwise drifts in a quiet repose. Folks are settled here, not much coming and going. Faces familiar in the way of old photographs. The people tend to their yards, the rhythm of daily chores marking time. In winter, the children sled down the hill on the side street, laughter echoing in the brittle air. Our house stands at the corner, a sentinel to the comings and goings, and we've grown acquainted with the cars that pass. A strange vehicle catches the eye, a note taken. Neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs, children pedal their bikes, the usual dance of suburb life. We stay home often, working from the house, my wife and I, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. Our presence as much a fixture as the old oak at the edge of the yard. We play outside, even when the rain falls. Sometimes we grill on the back deck, the scent of barbecue a comfort and a call. The sound of lawn mowers is a constant from March to October, when the grass finally yields. The neighborhood is shaded by trees, remnants of the wood that once stood here, and in Fall, leaves carpet the ground, demanding rake and flame. The smell of burning leaves is a harbinger of the season's turn. Winter has grown mild, a long Fall stretching its fingers over the months. Our garage sits at the back, rendering the front door nearly forgotten. When I work on my truck or other projects with the garage doors thrown open, I feel a part of the neighborhood's pulse. Holidays bring a hush over the street, Thanksgiving drawing families together, cars lining the curbs with out-of-town plates. It's the same for Mother's Day, for Christmas. This place is home, settled in the bones. If only it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "In the barren expanse of the high desert where the land stretches out with a relentless constancy of dirt and more dirt and where the horizon is a line of ochre and dust, my neighborhood stands. The brown earth is ever-present, a constant reminder of the sun’s relentless gaze, and where a green lawn emerges it speaks to the wealth of water spent in its keeping. Back in the nineties, the houses lay scattered across the landscape, distant as stars in a vast sky. Now they grow closer, like the slow encroachment of civilization upon a forgotten land, and the city creeps into being with each passing day, a reflection of change echoed in many places.\n\nThe folk here are kind enough, old faces with gentle smiles, and the neighborhood is good, or so it seems, as places go. Chain stores pepper the streets, Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, but for anything finer, the kind that speaks to luxury, you must travel far. Whole Foods and such are strangers to this dust-choked realm. The work that calls most is construction, the skeletal rise of buildings in the open spaces that still linger, and it unnerves me to think of what may come. I left the city once and have no wish to return to its clamor. My own trade is in the craft of walls and ceilings, a labor of hands shaping spaces.\n\nYet there is a beauty here in the starkness, a draw that pulls people to the high desert, a wilderness forged by harsh climate and rugged topography, a home to creatures that wander this arid land. We, who dwell here, must learn to share this place with them, these non-human neighbors, and find a way to live side by side. My family and I, we have made peace with the wild. My children, three in number, chase lizards and insects beneath the sun’s glare, their laughter echoing in the dusty air.\n\nFor those who seek diversion, Victorville offers its own charm, a place where families may find the desert’s heart. The annual San Bernardino County Fair brings its own brand of joy, a blend of tradition and revelry. Venture to Wrightwood to witness snow upon the peaks, to feel the cold bite and perhaps learn the art of winter’s sport. The Victor Valley Museum stands as a testament to the land’s history, with relics of stone and bone, the artifacts of those who walked before us, and the stories of industry and life in this place called Victorville.",
            "When I think on where I live, the truth of it is a place set apart from those who dwell in houses with yards and picket fences. A place that is not a place in the sense of possession but in the sense of habitation. The college campus is the land I call home, and the dormitory my house, and the souls who occupy it my kin. The sprawl of the campus reaches out like a township, its bounds and borders dissolving into the world beyond. Yet for all its peculiarity, it is a neighborhood not unlike any other. There are structures and there are people, there are places to gather and to dwell, places to buy and places to play.\n\nLet us speak of the structures first. There are the apartments, small and clustered, where two to four souls share a room, and the floors stack upon each other like strata of rock in the earth, two deep, housing twenty lives or more. There are the houses, rare and scattered, for those tied to the institution in ways more permanent, alumni who dwell in the past and present all at once. And there are the dormitories, vast and teeming, where hundreds find shelter, two by two, under a single roof. This is the lay of the land.\n\nNow to the people. The school boasts of its diversity, and in truth it is a tapestry of cultures and ages, woven together in this place. The staff inhabit the scattered houses, the young ones fill the dormitories, and the elder students find a home in the apartments. But words alone cannot capture the essence of these people, and so we move on to speak of the stores and parks.\n\nWithin this self-contained world are the places of commerce, the dining halls and shops that bear the school's own mark. All that one seeks can be found within these confines. And there is a park, a common ground where all meet, kept clean and safe by the hands of those who call this place home. A playground for the diverse populace, a testament to the care of the community.\n\nThis then is my neighborhood, a place both peculiar and familiar, a microcosm of life in all its forms.",
            "There are no sidewalks where I live. The land slopes down as if the earth itself is weary, and my house perches atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood. They call it the \"work out hill,\" this incline where joggers labor in their ascent, their footsteps echoing on the hard, unyielding road. The street is a patchwork of pitted asphalt, a test for tires and nerves alike. Overhead, the wires dangle, a tangled web of electric and telephone lines, tattered by storm and time. The rain comes often, a relentless visitor that lashes the trees and tears at the power lines, leaving them mended in a checkered mosaic of repairs.\n\nTall evergreens stand sentinel, their presence a source of contention among the people who live here. They cut them down when they can, these trees that dare obscure the vista of the ocean. The houses climb the hill, glass-fronted and defiant, each seeking the horizon where the bay meets the sky. At sunset the water ignites with an inner flame, the sky a canvas of orange, but more often than not, clouds loom heavy, and the sun's light is but a ghostly glow through the mist. The days are gray, the air heavy with moisture. Moss claims its dominion over roofs, cars, railings, anything it can grasp. I left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned it was a green beast, furred with moss, and it took three hours of scraping to see it shine again.\n\nChildren are scarce in these parts, though a school stands not far off. The neighborhood is a haven for the old, the retired, lives lived in quiet rhythm. Dogs replace the laughter of children, and they roam the yards and chase one another down the street. Leave a door ajar, and you might find one in your living room, a trespasser to be gently shooed away. Rabbits abound, burrowing and rooting, much to the gardeners' despair, yet my cats delight in them, their presence an invitation to hunt. The birds come too, sparrows and hummingbirds flitting among the branches, while hawks and eagles circle until the crows rally to drive them away.\n\nThere are no stores here, but down the hill where the land meets the sea lie a few restaurants, their offerings of fresh seafood a draw to the weary traveler. The shore is rocky, no beach to speak of, only stones to cast into the bay. The water is not wide; you can see the land across, a faint outline even through the ever-present mist.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, if your compass is set for Bensonhurst, you'd find no travail in reaching it. The veins of the city, the subways and buses, carry the echo of a metropolis that never sleeps. Bensonhurst stands a testament to the very heart of New York City. As you tread these streets, be prepared for the sight of Asian emporiums that seem to have sprung as if by some invisible hand. Two decades past, a tide of Asian souls found harbor here, and now their presence marks every block with stores like sentinels in a foreign land. Supermarkets and laundromats, their windows ablaze with neon, call out with the promise of sustenance and cleanliness. The food is good and costs less, a siren’s song for the thrifty. Close by, where I reside, four such markets lie within but a two-minute stroll, a testament to the ease of life’s provisions here.\n\nYet do not think Bensonhurst solely a canvas painted in Asian hues. No, it is a mosaic of the world, a gathering of immigrants and their progeny, a tapestry of first and second-generation Americans. Still, the Asian influence is strong, their hands guiding the most prominent of ventures. Nearby, a park lies renewed, a paradise of play with its courts and fields, swings and fountains where children find joy in the summer’s heat. Diversity reigns here, a harmony of tongues and hues, united in the dance of sport and leisure.\n\nBuildings do not climb to the sky here. They are humble, two-family homes holding their ground against the encroaching shadows of co-ops and condominiums. The people, they are kind but loud, their voices rising with the blare of car radios, engines roaring like beasts unchained, rousing the slumbering dawn.\n\nAs night falls, tread with caution. Bensonhurst is safe, mostly, but the heart of man is a mystery. Trouble lurks in the guise of youth and thieves, shadows that once found me and left their mark. Packages vanish as if by magic, spirited away by unseen hands. And then there is the matter of dogs, their leavings a blight on the streets. It is the law here to clean after them, but the law is a whisper in the wind, often unheard. Daily, the waste litters the path to the train, to the market, a constant companion to the wary traveler. Tread carefully, lest your soles carry the stain of this place.",
            "The first thing you must grasp about Portland, Oregon is the notion of \"weird.\" A phrase scrawled across the backside of a building that stands as a pizza parlor, a bar, a music stage, a den of undress, and skirts the fringes of law like a thin veil, shouts \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it whispers of a bygone era, the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, less known and less dear, where subcultures bloomed like wildflowers in the cracks of pavement. To others, it's a siren's call, beckoning to those who wear their oddities as a badge of honor. Despite the flood of well-heeled Californians and the ceaseless rise of condominiums to shelter them, Portland remains in its peculiar embrace. Yet, weird does not always dance with acceptance, though it opens its arms to the unaccepted. It does not mean we shun the trappings of the modern age or the battles it brings. Like the rest of the land, our goods bear the mark of distant shores. A million shades of weirdness, each hue not quite normal, yet Portland wears its normalcy too: yoga and hipsters and suits of business. Perhaps weird means we hold all this with a lighter heart. In my corner of this city, as in many others, houses boast colors bright, gardens spill with blooms and herbs and vegetables, and the sidewalks are lined with free boxes when summer reigns. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold treasures discarded yet perfect, waiting for the right soul to pass by. A book, a garment, or anything at all might lie within. This magical chance of a stroll through a Southeast neighborhood captures the essence of Portland as I see it, though I am but one among the myriad shades of weird. Some neighbors would not dream of plucking their attire from a sidewalk box. They seek out goat yoga—yes, yoga amidst live goats—or rally their voices at Timbers matches, cheering the city's soccer heroes. Portland brims with souls bound to their passions, some chasing dreams, others dreaming amid the bar’s embrace. Ours is a city with a drug scourge, often rooted deep in the mind’s struggles, the relentless rain and brooding clouds a possible accomplice. Homelessness casts a long shadow, a riddle unsolved. Drawn here by social services more generous than most lands, yet still they fall short. The rest of us sway between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not so strange at all.",
            "The mountains stood eternal, witness to the sun's ancient journey, keeping their vigil in the north. They did not waver, unmoved by the clamor of life, while I, lost in the pursuits of my days, often forgot them. Yet they were always there, demanding to be seen when the weight of the world bore down upon me. I would turn to them, find solace in their stoic presence, and gather strength to carry on, a day at a time. \n\nWhen I first came to this place for my studies, it was those mountains north of the campus that seized my heart. The university had its own charms—grand buildings, tranquil ponds, and whispering trees—but the mountains reigned supreme, an unyielding king. The town itself held beauty, a tapestry of small cafés where time slipped by in caffeine-fueled marathons of study. A few steps more, and the downtown embraced you with its echo of ages, the faded bricks lining the streets, a testament to time's passage. Here, this quiet town found its pulse, a brief surge of city life in the midst of its suburban calm. But the chaos did not stretch far, and beyond the library lay the quiet refuge of small-town peace.\n\nThis city, with its shifting moods, beckoned exploration, each corner a memory waiting to be made. Strolls past the rusty swings in the park after nights without sleep, or dashing through the bustling streets to catch a show at the theater, tickets courtesy of the university. But as with all places, it bore its share of sorrow. The ponds, mirrors of the soul, offered refuge in moments of introspection and tears, the moon high and the hour late, as life's questions loomed large. Watching the birds and insects go about their business, I pondered my place, adrift in the enigma of existence.\n\nAnd so, I wandered past the ponds, past the park, through the neighborhoods with their quiet houses, until I reached the main road. There the sun cast its radiant light upon the palms, painting the sky in hues of dawn. I realized my steps had led me northward. And there they were, as ever, the mountains, brushing the hazy sky with their grandeur. In their silent counsel, I found my resolve, steadfast as the mountains themselves.",
            "You might pass it by, not seeing it at first. It's just a residential area behind a row of shops, a place not much thought of for living. Not for most anyway. But if you wander past the deserted Whole Foods, past the hotels that fill only once a year save for the summer's brief gatherings of kin, you'll find a lively enclave hidden there. On these streets, lined up like those Russian dolls, each apartment block is set down one beside the other, a careful and deliberate array. The first buildings you come to have held stories in the news, tales not fit for repeating, so we'll leave them in their shadows. But beyond them lies another realm, one few know of. Across the street, a quiet campus for a community college stands, a sleepy bastion where students arrive, coffee in hand, stifling yawns in the early hours to start their long days. The iron gates groan wide to let them through, while the commuters grumble in their cars, fists shaking at the delay when the crowd grows thick. The road bends into another, lined with homes, where a park lies on one side and a center for healing broken bones on the other. The rehab place has its porch set with cheerful seats and a fan that churns slowly in the summer's heavy air. Children dash through the park's grass, spinning and laughing among the flowers where bees drone lazily. Elderly folk walk dogs, frowning at the skaters, nodding with a kind of knowing to the girls who whisper secrets by the swings. A strip mall by the park holds a sushi place, never quite busy, and you’ll find a shop for pool supplies and a nail salon beside it, snug and unassuming. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, and eat hibachi all at once—such is the charm of these small-town malls. A frozen yogurt shop is there as well, the kind where you serve yourself, and you’ll see the teens at the park with their cold, dripping cups, doing tricks on skateboards, puffing clouds of vapor, the picture of what they think is cool. This neighborhood, it's a slice of old America, a piece of the quiet South where time seems to stand still and little ever changes.",
            "The neighborhood stands as a relic of another era, where the American dream was once a tangible thing. Houses line the streets, mostly single-family dwellings, but there are those split in two, attached as if in some forgotten symbiosis. My own home sits with a small yard before it, a humble driveway to its side, an echo of a time when the suburbs embraced this nation, now distant and drawing away. Yet this place remains, whispering the dream still breathes, and we clutch at it with the last of our strength.\n\nThe optimism that once painted the faces of the people fades like old photographs. The little yards no longer kept with the same pride, but still, cars rest in the driveways, and the children play as if the world beyond their laughter were nothing but a distant dream. The old school, standing nearly ninety years, seems to hold the future in its walls, a vessel of nostalgia for the elders who pass by. Churches stand few and far between, their pews empty, but the courts where basketballs echo are never silent.\n\nEach house wears a different face yet shares the same soul. A large market, Super \"A,\" held by a Yemeni family, perhaps the sole Arab roots in this soil. The majority here are African American, their stories woven into the fabric of this place. Streets wide and welcoming, where kids play their games, momentarily pausing for the passing cars. Generations have settled here, telling tales of a time when every neighbor was a friend.\n\nOnce there was a karate school. When Hollywood ceased to spin tales of karate kids, the children turned away, and now it stands as a pharmacy, the promise that pills can mend what ails you. A small movie theater clings to life, showing old films at a price the young deem unworthy, but the elders find solace in its dim light, escaping the clamor of youthful ambition.\n\nThe expressway cuts through the town, though its access lies elsewhere. There was a time when a petition called for an exit here, the young cried for it, but the elders held firm in their refusal, fearing it would rend the fabric of their home. A new high school rises, and with it, the debate over a mascot. A cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin, a fitting emblem for this place that straddles the past and the future with a foot in each.",
            "In the sprawling city where I dwell, the neighborhood is a patchwork of lives and places, a mosaic of humanity's ventures. Houses and homes scattered among the commerce of life, as if cast by the hand of some indifferent god. Offices stand beside stores and eateries, theaters of delights and distractions. There is always a new table to lay one's troubles upon or a shop to wander through, seeking what one does not know one seeks. The grand emporiums, names known and whispered across lands, stand shoulder to shoulder with small sanctuaries of goods, boutiques that speak in softer tones and beckon the passerby. They line the thoroughfares, these establishments, and their presence brings a hum to the quarters that would otherwise nest in silence.\n\nThe parks are not far, green havens where mothers and fathers bring their young to bask in the innocence of play. And the people, oh, the people, they are of every kind. Here is a place where the colors of the world mix and mingle, a tapestry woven with threads of many origins. The pride of the LGBTQ+ lives alongside the solemnity of the Orthodox Jew, and the echoes of the Soviet Union find refuge here. Beyond, the city stretches, each enclave a world unto itself, Korea, China, Armenia, and more, each a testament to the journeys of the soul.\n\nBut the roads are long, and the hours pass slowly in the confines of the steel chariots that crawl upon them. A journey of mere miles becomes an odyssey, and the feet of men grow idle. The city sprawls wide, and the habit of walking has withered under the weight of time and distance. Our streets, they are burdened with the ceaseless flow of traffic, a river of iron that knows no peace, and the finding of a place to rest one's vehicle is a quest unto itself.\n\nYet still they come, the builders with their dreams of towering abodes, casting shadows upon the land. A place of allure, yet the hearts of those who dwell here grow weary at the thought of more souls, more wheels upon the roads. The homes are as varied as the people, from grand dwellings to humble abodes, each a story in itself, each a shelter from the world’s chaos. Here families find their refuge, and here, in the quiet corners, the children once played, their laughter a balm against the solitude of the city.\n\nI know not the faces of most who share this place with me. The bonds that once tied us close have slackened, though in the memory of youth, I recall the days when we were kin, neighbors whose doors were always open. Those were the days of sunlight and simplicity, when the world was small and kind.",
            "Where is everything? she asked from the seat beside me, her eyes wide as we drove through the endless stretch of cornfields that framed the world. This is it, I replied, a wry smile on my lips, knowing full well her disbelief in the vacancy of the land. She hailed from a town where a grocery store lay just a stone's throw from her doorstep, where wide-open spaces were a rarity, a myth. But here, amidst the vastness, I unfolded the story of my upbringing in rural Ohio, and in that telling, she began to see the roots that held me. Down that narrow country road, past the fields and the sunlit quarry brimming with water, lay the small enclave where I was born and raised. The houses stood firm in brick and stucco, each claiming half an acre or more, every bit of land a testament to the pride of its keeper. Come spring, flowers burst forth in riotous color, and the trees, ever loyal to the seasons, donned their changing garb. In the driveways, Mercedes Benz cars gleamed, freshly baptized by the hose, their surfaces a mirror to the midday sun. As we neared my gray stucco house, my Korean neighbor waved, his face a map of kindness. He spent his days under the sky, the grass his canvas, and his mower his brush, a song rising above its mechanical drone. We all found joy in his tune, a melody of sincerity, and the stories of his past. Once a doctor, now a part of the landscape, he rode his John Deere as if it were an extension of himself. And finally, my home. In the side yard, the geese gathered, scattering before the exuberant chase of our Terrier. Beyond the house, a stream meandered, singing its quiet song as it flowed toward the quarry. Bullfrogs joined the chorus, their calls mingling with the distant lowing of cattle. Across a bridge crafted by hand, an untouched sanctuary waited, where trees grew wild and herbs and flowers bloomed without hindrance. Here was my realm of childhood, a place of forts built high in branches, of imagined hunts where the chase was the thrill. Always some child nearby, ready to join in the adventure. Winters brought a cold that bit deep, yet with it came a beauty unmatched. The land transformed, the vibrant hues of summer giving way to stark silhouettes of trees, their limbs bare against the sky. Snow, when it came, cloaked everything in silence, a wonderland in white. My sister and I, adversaries in play, took to snowballs as our chosen arms, constructing forts of snow and branch to hold our arsenal. In that frozen world, we found our freedom, children unburdened by the weight of years, lost in the simple joy of being."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies my small town in Michigan, where the old roads meander through farmland and spill into quaint tourist cities. There are no sprawling malls or neon-lit Walmarts, no Targets or even an Applebee’s to speak of. The places you might need lie far off, and travel is a necessity. Yet, despite this, I find myself amidst a beauty unparalleled, encircled by the waters that have cradled this land. My town, if it can be called so, is a peninsula gripped by the arms of Lake Michigan on one flank and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Shores abound where one might wander and feel the cool kiss of the lake upon their feet.\n\nThe neighborhood I call home breathes the essence of small-town life. Houses stand solitary, each with its own story, not replicas of one another, but elder structures, some renewed, others bearing the weight of years. Basements lie beneath, full and visible from the roads that wind by. Aluminum siding clings to many, weathered and strong, and the color of the homes is a patchwork quilt that encircles my own. Yards stretch out before them, where children play upon trampolines and swingsets, where gardens grow and fences keep watch over the creatures within. It is Middle America, a testament to the toils of those who live within its boundaries, raising their kin or having done so.\n\nThe streets are alive with the laughter of children, the steady rhythm of bikes and rollerblades, the soft pad of dogs led by their masters. Neighbors nod in recognition, aware of who belongs and who is a stranger. A wave from a grill, a smile from a passerby with their dog, are the currency of this place. Lawns are tended with care, green and trim, free from the decay of autumn leaves. Plants and bushes stand in neat array, pruned and orderly. It is not a neighborhood that daunts with grandeur but one that whispers of solace and family, of quiet and safety. It is an average place made exceptional by the promise it holds—a sanctuary at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s department keeps vigil, and the health department stands in its shadow. The city recycling center lies just beyond, a hub for the surrounding folk. Baseball and softball fields echo with the voices of announcers and the names of players, and beside them, a small-town airport sends its planes skyward, their engines a low rumble in the air. Ice cream is within reach, a sweet reward at the end of a walk, and downtown beckons from a distance. My children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away, a testament to the spirit of this place. It is a good place to call home.",
            "In the place where I call home, the landscape is a tapestry of sameness, each thread meticulously placed by the unseen hand of the homeowners' association. Upon crossing the threshold into this suburban sprawl, you are met with a parade of houses, each a mirror to the next, their facades pristine and unyielding. The lawns are kept in a neat patchwork of green, sprinkled with stones for ornament, and short driveways lead to garages built for two. Here and there, a tree stands sentinel, a modest testament to nature’s incursion.\n\nThe roads, freshly paved, snake through this enclave of the ordinary, unmarred by potholes or the scars of time, a testament to the diligence of those who see to such matters. The homes stand mostly single-storied, though some dare to reach higher, their windows like eyes watching the quiet streets. Gone are the solitary mailboxes that once marked each plot; in their stead, a cluster waits at the street’s end, keys clinking in locks as neighbors retrieve their mail and packages from the shared boxes—a nod to the unyielding quest for uniformity.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, this neighborhood is a strange blend of the rural and the suburban, sprawling across ample land. Community pools lie behind gates, inviting yet untroubled, while paths wind through the area, offering solace to those who walk their dogs or seek solitude in the fading light. Parks are unnecessary here; the neighborhood itself is vast enough for any runner’s ambition.\n\nRetirees make up the bulk of this community, eyes watching out for one another, bringing a sense of safety that wraps around you like a well-worn coat. But among them, younger faces emerge—professionals who have found a place here, amidst the quiet.\n\nThe city itself looms larger in number than in spirit, a place where the pulse of a small town beats beneath the skin of a bustling populace. There’s a mall, modest in its offerings but sufficient to the needs of those who wander through its halls. Fifteen minutes is the measure of the distance to the heart of commerce, where stores line the streets, each a promise of goods, from the finest organic markets to the stark shelves of discount outlets.\n\nThis neighborhood is a haven of safety and order, with pools to cool the heat of summer and trails that wind like thoughts through the terrain. And though the shops lie further afield, a short drive delivers you to the doors of any chain you desire, convenience a mere engine's purr away.",
            "I first learned of my dwelling through a podcast about the vanished. Surprising in its own right. This place where apartments fetch a thousand a month and yet tales of the lost lingered unknown. Neither I nor my friends knew of such stories. Perhaps it's the struggle. Some nights, friends weep themselves into restless sleep. The cost of living steep, yet frugality's been our teacher over the years. The scent of flea market relics and mothballed garments becomes familiar, almost comforting. The smells of adulthood, subdued in their presence, cling to you like a second skin. Smoking or simply accustomed, you find the flea market's essence undeniable. Dusty magazines on a silent piano. The scent burrows into leather, stubborn against washing. Here, three thrift stores lie within steps. Start at the far end, wander through charity thrifts, past a library, a rare book shop, and a store of curiosities. Downtown, dense with life, cars and people throng the streets, yet within the thrift's walls, silence prevails. The perfect refuge for an afternoon adrift. Each year, more souls flood the city. A city swelling under the weight of its own burgeoning empire. A place reminiscent of New York, where people pursue their own paths, seldom asking of you. Alone, a quiet independence respected. Not like the South, where curiosity signals care. Here, lives remain unprobed, shells intact as the city ebbs and flows like tides. A place alive, between the pianist next door and the singers above. Strangers in apartments become a community. Needs met, birthdays marked, funerals mourned, aid given. Fortunate to be here, neighbors kind and well-meaning. I return the favor, tidying after myself, sharing food. Mail exchanged. A pleasure to see them, and perhaps they think the same of me. In this vast, impersonal sprawl, it's the neighbors who make it feel less like ruin.",
            "In a small town nestled in the Midwest, there lies the edge of the world, just beyond the reach of the city where the sprawling suburbs give way to a more modest existence. The neighborhood where I dwell stands on the eastern fringe, marked by economic struggle and homes that wear the years in their sagging frames. Low the worth of these lands, where tenants and owners alike count their pennies, yet there is a beauty that resists the sum of its parts. The people who pass by offer a nod, a greeting, their faces lined with stories untold. \n\nCrime has its own dance here, a little more frequent than in other quarters, yet it does not overshadow the day. Tales of violence linger in the air, whispers of past years where blood was spilled not far from where I lay my head. Our next-door neighbors, they lost a son to the night outside a bar where shadows stretch long. But fortune has spared us the worst, our losses confined to what the porch could not guard.\n\nThe town itself bears the scars of a different war, the kind fought with needles and pills. The scourge of opioids, fentanyl a ghostly reaper, has claimed many souls. Yet even in this, there is a battle waged, with centers for healing and hands that train others to bring back the lost from the brink.\n\nAmidst these trials, light finds its way. My son attends a school where the halls hum with a kindness that shields him from life's cruelties. The teachers there, the staff, they are a beacon, and the boy thrives in their care. The community gathers, a PTO that breathes life into the year with events that bind us all together. In a town where poverty stalks one in five, the school offers its children meals freely, a stand against hunger. No child there feels the weight of what they cannot pay.\n\nThe city fathers have turned their gaze to the heart of the town, paving roads, tending to the green, yet the east where I dwell remains a shadow in their plans. The center thrives, the west bustles with commerce, but here on the eastern edge, we wait for the light to reach us.\n\nStill, this town is home. Its people, its schools, the shops that line its streets, they meet our needs. The house we call ours may not boast of wealth, but it holds comfort, and that is its own treasure. Sixteen years we have stood upon this soil, and in our hearts, there lies no desire to be elsewhere.",
            "In the heart of the city stands a neighborhood steeped in tales of its own, perched upon a hill and hemmed in by the memories of structures long past. I dwell in a seven-story apartment, a lone sentinel across from the old theater where once voices soared and stories unfurled. Down the slope, a block away, lies a curious haunt, an arcade bar, where souls converge in the sultry throes of summer nights. June and July see them in clusters, a line snaking along the pavement, each waiting for a moment inside. Not far, the city park sprawls wide, a rare expanse of green amid the urban sprawl. Concrete girds it and stairs run steep, carved into the earth like secrets kept. When winter's breath bites, the homeless come, pitching tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk, the wide steps their refuge. Snow is scarce, but the rain comes relentless, a deluge that chills bones and spirits alike. They huddle close, seeking warmth in the city's core, not far from the family center where solace might be found, a chance to wash away the grime of wandering. But it is not these things that bind me to this place. It is not the grandeur of the past, nor the elegance of architecture that graces the hillsides sloping to the sea. What I cherish is the spirit of the people, the tapestry of lives woven through Hilltop. Once, it was a name spoken in fear, a haven for violence that painted the West Coast red. Stories linger still, whispers of the DEA and federal might sweeping through like a cleansing wind. The people remember, passing tales from one generation to the next, even to newcomers like myself. They toil in earnest, striving to shed the past, to nurture their streets with care and pride. Some say it's unwise to walk Hilltop by night if you're white, a caution rooted in bygone days and the bitter tang of prejudice. Yet, perhaps I tread unnoticed, just dark enough to blend, or maybe Hilltop sees in me a kindred soul, one who knows the weight of history that bears down upon us all. In a city that should be a mosaic of cultures, the old wounds still fester. But the Hilltop is my heart. Walking those streets under the cloak of night, I find life there, a kinship with people more likely to offer a coat than ill intent. It's a place where laundromat lights linger longer for a phone to find power, where I've sat shrouded in the night’s chill, only to be seen, handed a token of humanity, and told I am beautiful and worth something.",
            "I came to this place on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world was as uncertain as the shadows cast by the old elms at dusk. It was not easy to find kin in those early days. Yet I found myself drawn close to a lad who dwelt two doors down and another who lived along the same winding street. Those boys are gone now, their laughter and companionship scattered to the winds, but the echoes of our time remain etched into the fabric of this place. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still here, their lives woven into the quiet tapestry of this American suburb.\n\nThe houses here stand two stories tall, their facades reflecting the sameness of the world in which they stand. On warm days, the voices of children thread through the air, a symphony of innocence and joy. But for the most part, silence reigns here, and I have never found cause for discord among these neighbors. Solitude is a gift in this place, until the hour comes when you seek the hands of others. Packages arrive at my door, untouched by the specter of theft, and I find a strange solace in this trust.\n\nA park lies a stone’s throw from my door, a realm of memories both cherished and unwelcome. There I have played games of sport, felt the sting of a wayward elbow upon my nose, yet the warmth of camaraderie overshadows such fleeting pain. Nowadays, when my feet tread that familiar ground, it is with my cousin’s young ones, their delight in the swings and slides a balm for nostalgia's ache.\n\nThis neighborhood is a patchwork of souls and stories, diverse as the flavors that linger in the air. Within a mile's stride, one finds the spices of China, India, Mexico, and Italy. Yet the folk here often summon their meals through the ether, with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash delivering sustenance to their doors. The fast-food joints hold sway, as they do in many suburbs, their lights a beacon of sameness. Yet there is variety to be found, even an Indian-owned store that beckons with promises of distant lands.\n\nThe shops here are a bounty of necessity and indulgence, from dry cleaners to pharmacies, and the Jewel-Osco, a staple of the Midwest. This place, with its quiet streets and whispers of wind, has become a refuge. Tales from the world beyond, tales of strife and neighborly woe, serve only to deepen my gratitude for the peace I find here.",
            "The world as I find it lies close by the college where I spend my days, and I take some solace in that fact. The landscape is dotted with apartment blocks and the occasional refuge of dining and drink, places that offer a modicum of diversion without too severe a toll on the pocket. A certain tavern recently took on a new name and with it a heftier price, though the spirits and service could be worse. Folks here are largely amiable. They are students or else of modest means, drawn by the low rents. Children abound, their laughter mingling with the breeze from the nearby school. I keep to my own and have no need for the company of neighbors. They indulge in the smoke that clouds the halls, prompting management to install an air freshener outside their door, an action that my companion and I find near comical in its futility. \n\nThe buildings carry the weight of years in their visage though some hide modern interiors. Down the way, new homes rise, hollow in construction yet dressed in high rents, a charade tolerated due to their nearness to the campus. A mere five minutes’ walk finds a cheap eatery where food, served on paper, emerges from the hum of microwaves. Across the street stands a gas station, its reputation as an employer poor. Yet, the city’s hand has touched the road, granting it a fresh face with wide sidewalks and green spaces, an attempt at grace amidst decay. My own dwelling is cushioned by trees, though some have fallen to the axe, leaving behind stumps, reminders of what once was. Behind the apartment lies another street, less cared for, its walkways crumbling, its buildings weary. Trees line the avenue, perhaps to veil the neglect beneath. \n\nCrime is whispered of, particularly from a complex down yonder, though it is not alone in such tales. Across from my own abode, shadows flit through a transient populace, but I find contentment here. It suits my purse, and the conveniences are many—the university a short walk, the buses ready to carry me to the market or into the heart of the town.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawled beneath the wide and endless sky, where duplexes stood in quiet formation along the cul-de-sac, each painted in the same sun-drenched yellow with white porches and roofs of green metal. They seemed to stand as solitary houses, scattered like memories of another time. In the evenings, we gather, a cluster of souls at the end of a driveway not marked by plan or intent, while children spin their worlds in colored chalk and kites that strain against the tethering earth. It is a breath of yesterday in a world too quickened by machines and screens. The fields stretch wide around us, wrapped in the arms of trees, the sky above a canvas of blue and cloud, and yet there is a shadow that leans upon the land.  \n\nIn this season, the air is thick with the threat of storms, and last night the sirens rose, their wail cutting through the stillness, driving us to shelter. I found myself ensconced in the narrow womb of the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, a purse, a few pillows. The large dog refused the sanctuary of the bathroom, pacing and barking in the living room, unsettled by the strangeness of the hour. Outside, the world was silent save for the hammer of hail upon the earth, the neighborhood hushed in anticipation.  \n\nWhen the storm had passed, the road was a river of steam, the heat of the day fleeing before the sudden coolness. The temperature had fallen like a stone, the hail melting as it met the hot ground. I looked up, and the sky was clearing, the sun breaking through to paint a double rainbow across the heavens. I ran inside, fetched my camera, capturing the moment to share with kin and friends far distant, their awe echoing my own.  \n\nThe streets remained still for a time, until the people returned from where they had sought refuge, the rhythm of life resuming its gentle cadence. Mothers and children emerged, the scent of cooking meals drifting on the air. It is a place of warmth and welcome to this stranger from the north, where the voices are wrapped in the soft music of the southern drawl.  \n\nMy dwelling is like all the others, two bedrooms, two baths, though within each lies its own secret, some small, some spacious, a mystery of design. I find solace in the great field behind, where a path winds to a pond not meant for swimming, a place where deer wander and the bullfrog sings his morning song. It is a sanctuary, just beyond the city's reach, where each dawn is heralded by the crow of roosters, the farms that border our small enclave. And in the evening, the bray of a donkey calls out from a nearby farm, a voice in the gathering dusk. This place, this hidden gem of a neighborhood, has offered me its quiet grace.",
            "In the ten years I've wandered this patch of earth, there's been a reckonin' of sorts within me. When first my feet set upon this ground, I was adrift in sorrow. Riverdale lay behind, its memory a shadow clinging close. My tears fell, for I left behind kin and land I loved. But my mama and papa sought a better place, a place where my sister and I could grow like saplings unbent by the wind, in a house they deemed fit for us, in a school unmarred by the ghetto's whisper. \n\nTime, that old relentless river, carried me forward. In its flow, I found companions and foes, both. Of the neighbors, I came to know but a few. Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis, they were all in the circle of my knowing. They've been a solace, almost kin, and for that, I hold them dear. I recall, clear as day, the time when we all went to see Mr. Glen wed anew. It was a day of lightness, a day to dream of for my own future, of a life wrought in gold for some bride to be. When Miss Veda cast her garter into the air, it was I who caught it, though the flowers escaped my grasp. We danced beneath the stars, and I took joy with Marsharii, his daughter, a fleeting presence whose path I hope has led to grander things.\n\nThe streets here wind like a labyrinth, though now with the guide of a GPS, I find time to wander. My feet have carried me as far as they dared with Kason and Curtis at my side. We, who spent our days lost in games and laughter, living each moment as if it were our last. The park calls to me often, a balm for my spirit, offering solace beneath its boughs. There, among the trees, I find my balance with sticks from the depot, wielding my bokken like a samurai of old.\n\nCourts for tennis and basketball stand silent, though they remember the sweat and toil of our games. My father, alongside Mr. Graves, taught us the ways of tennis, and in their training, we found joy. Yes, this place has held many moments of delight, tales etched in the fabric of my being. Yet still, I sense the horizon holds more, a promise of the best yet to unfurl.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies Johnston, a town that whispers its own tales. It's not a place that strikes one as distinct, yet it holds its ground in the world of agriculture. They call it the Peach Capital of the World, a claim that stands bold against the sky on the town’s sign. Fields stretch wide, a patchwork of peach trees and cattle pastures, the land breathing in the sun's relentless gaze. Houses, those not within the town's narrow heart, scatter themselves across the countryside. Some rise two stories high, capped with metal against the summer blaze or clad in gray shingles. They sit back from the road, granting the front fields to animals or crops as though in quiet homage to the land.\n\nIn the town's core, a lone stoplight sways above the crossroads, marking the hub of commerce. A triad of eateries offers solace to the hungry traveler: Hong Kong, a small Chinese enclave run by one family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary’s, a humble burger joint. The pizzeria shuttered its doors not long ago, leaving its absence to echo in the town’s memory. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family pharmacy, finds renown not for its pills but for the Cherry Coca-Cola that bubbles within its walls. Then there’s the IGA, a grocery store both small and dear, where shoppers pick up just a thing or two before heading to the Walmart yonder in Batesburg-Leesville.\n\nDollar General stands as the town's beacon, its shelves laden with the essentials of everyday life, bustling from dawn till dusk. Nearby, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a woman known to all, has stood for a generation. Two men work there, delivering sofas and tables to those who call the town home. Attached is Clark’s Cuts and Kennels, where pets are groomed and tended, their services a comfort to the residents.\n\nA doctor and a veterinarian offer their care on the outskirts, small practices but sufficient. Johnston Elementary holds the town's children until fifth grade, after which they venture to the next town for further schooling. There’s talk of a park, 2.5 acres of promise, where families might gather and outsiders be drawn. For now, the town offers no theaters, no alleys for bowling, no places for idle gathering. But in its quiet, Johnston holds a charm, fleeting as it may be, that lingers even as one passes through, perhaps without noticing at all.",
            "In the small southern town of Tennessee where I live, there's a street that runs between two state highways, drawing more traffic than one might hope for. The neighborhood otherwise drifts in a quiet repose. Folks are settled here, not much coming and going. Faces familiar in the way of old photographs. The people tend to their yards, the rhythm of daily chores marking time. In winter, the children sled down the hill on the side street, laughter echoing in the brittle air. Our house stands at the corner, a sentinel to the comings and goings, and we've grown acquainted with the cars that pass. A strange vehicle catches the eye, a note taken. Neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs, children pedal their bikes, the usual dance of suburb life. We stay home often, working from the house, my wife and I, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. Our presence as much a fixture as the old oak at the edge of the yard. We play outside, even when the rain falls. Sometimes we grill on the back deck, the scent of barbecue a comfort and a call. The sound of lawn mowers is a constant from March to October, when the grass finally yields. The neighborhood is shaded by trees, remnants of the wood that once stood here, and in Fall, leaves carpet the ground, demanding rake and flame. The smell of burning leaves is a harbinger of the season's turn. Winter has grown mild, a long Fall stretching its fingers over the months. Our garage sits at the back, rendering the front door nearly forgotten. When I work on my truck or other projects with the garage doors thrown open, I feel a part of the neighborhood's pulse. Holidays bring a hush over the street, Thanksgiving drawing families together, cars lining the curbs with out-of-town plates. It's the same for Mother's Day, for Christmas. This place is home, settled in the bones. If only it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "In the barren expanse of the high desert where the land stretches out with a relentless constancy of dirt and more dirt and where the horizon is a line of ochre and dust, my neighborhood stands. The brown earth is ever-present, a constant reminder of the sun’s relentless gaze, and where a green lawn emerges it speaks to the wealth of water spent in its keeping. Back in the nineties, the houses lay scattered across the landscape, distant as stars in a vast sky. Now they grow closer, like the slow encroachment of civilization upon a forgotten land, and the city creeps into being with each passing day, a reflection of change echoed in many places.\n\nThe folk here are kind enough, old faces with gentle smiles, and the neighborhood is good, or so it seems, as places go. Chain stores pepper the streets, Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, but for anything finer, the kind that speaks to luxury, you must travel far. Whole Foods and such are strangers to this dust-choked realm. The work that calls most is construction, the skeletal rise of buildings in the open spaces that still linger, and it unnerves me to think of what may come. I left the city once and have no wish to return to its clamor. My own trade is in the craft of walls and ceilings, a labor of hands shaping spaces.\n\nYet there is a beauty here in the starkness, a draw that pulls people to the high desert, a wilderness forged by harsh climate and rugged topography, a home to creatures that wander this arid land. We, who dwell here, must learn to share this place with them, these non-human neighbors, and find a way to live side by side. My family and I, we have made peace with the wild. My children, three in number, chase lizards and insects beneath the sun’s glare, their laughter echoing in the dusty air.\n\nFor those who seek diversion, Victorville offers its own charm, a place where families may find the desert’s heart. The annual San Bernardino County Fair brings its own brand of joy, a blend of tradition and revelry. Venture to Wrightwood to witness snow upon the peaks, to feel the cold bite and perhaps learn the art of winter’s sport. The Victor Valley Museum stands as a testament to the land’s history, with relics of stone and bone, the artifacts of those who walked before us, and the stories of industry and life in this place called Victorville.",
            "When I think on where I live, the truth of it is a place set apart from those who dwell in houses with yards and picket fences. A place that is not a place in the sense of possession but in the sense of habitation. The college campus is the land I call home, and the dormitory my house, and the souls who occupy it my kin. The sprawl of the campus reaches out like a township, its bounds and borders dissolving into the world beyond. Yet for all its peculiarity, it is a neighborhood not unlike any other. There are structures and there are people, there are places to gather and to dwell, places to buy and places to play.\n\nLet us speak of the structures first. There are the apartments, small and clustered, where two to four souls share a room, and the floors stack upon each other like strata of rock in the earth, two deep, housing twenty lives or more. There are the houses, rare and scattered, for those tied to the institution in ways more permanent, alumni who dwell in the past and present all at once. And there are the dormitories, vast and teeming, where hundreds find shelter, two by two, under a single roof. This is the lay of the land.\n\nNow to the people. The school boasts of its diversity, and in truth it is a tapestry of cultures and ages, woven together in this place. The staff inhabit the scattered houses, the young ones fill the dormitories, and the elder students find a home in the apartments. But words alone cannot capture the essence of these people, and so we move on to speak of the stores and parks.\n\nWithin this self-contained world are the places of commerce, the dining halls and shops that bear the school's own mark. All that one seeks can be found within these confines. And there is a park, a common ground where all meet, kept clean and safe by the hands of those who call this place home. A playground for the diverse populace, a testament to the care of the community.\n\nThis then is my neighborhood, a place both peculiar and familiar, a microcosm of life in all its forms.",
            "There are no sidewalks where I live. The land slopes down as if the earth itself is weary, and my house perches atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood. They call it the \"work out hill,\" this incline where joggers labor in their ascent, their footsteps echoing on the hard, unyielding road. The street is a patchwork of pitted asphalt, a test for tires and nerves alike. Overhead, the wires dangle, a tangled web of electric and telephone lines, tattered by storm and time. The rain comes often, a relentless visitor that lashes the trees and tears at the power lines, leaving them mended in a checkered mosaic of repairs.\n\nTall evergreens stand sentinel, their presence a source of contention among the people who live here. They cut them down when they can, these trees that dare obscure the vista of the ocean. The houses climb the hill, glass-fronted and defiant, each seeking the horizon where the bay meets the sky. At sunset the water ignites with an inner flame, the sky a canvas of orange, but more often than not, clouds loom heavy, and the sun's light is but a ghostly glow through the mist. The days are gray, the air heavy with moisture. Moss claims its dominion over roofs, cars, railings, anything it can grasp. I left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned it was a green beast, furred with moss, and it took three hours of scraping to see it shine again.\n\nChildren are scarce in these parts, though a school stands not far off. The neighborhood is a haven for the old, the retired, lives lived in quiet rhythm. Dogs replace the laughter of children, and they roam the yards and chase one another down the street. Leave a door ajar, and you might find one in your living room, a trespasser to be gently shooed away. Rabbits abound, burrowing and rooting, much to the gardeners' despair, yet my cats delight in them, their presence an invitation to hunt. The birds come too, sparrows and hummingbirds flitting among the branches, while hawks and eagles circle until the crows rally to drive them away.\n\nThere are no stores here, but down the hill where the land meets the sea lie a few restaurants, their offerings of fresh seafood a draw to the weary traveler. The shore is rocky, no beach to speak of, only stones to cast into the bay. The water is not wide; you can see the land across, a faint outline even through the ever-present mist.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, if your compass is set for Bensonhurst, you'd find no travail in reaching it. The veins of the city, the subways and buses, carry the echo of a metropolis that never sleeps. Bensonhurst stands a testament to the very heart of New York City. As you tread these streets, be prepared for the sight of Asian emporiums that seem to have sprung as if by some invisible hand. Two decades past, a tide of Asian souls found harbor here, and now their presence marks every block with stores like sentinels in a foreign land. Supermarkets and laundromats, their windows ablaze with neon, call out with the promise of sustenance and cleanliness. The food is good and costs less, a siren’s song for the thrifty. Close by, where I reside, four such markets lie within but a two-minute stroll, a testament to the ease of life’s provisions here.\n\nYet do not think Bensonhurst solely a canvas painted in Asian hues. No, it is a mosaic of the world, a gathering of immigrants and their progeny, a tapestry of first and second-generation Americans. Still, the Asian influence is strong, their hands guiding the most prominent of ventures. Nearby, a park lies renewed, a paradise of play with its courts and fields, swings and fountains where children find joy in the summer’s heat. Diversity reigns here, a harmony of tongues and hues, united in the dance of sport and leisure.\n\nBuildings do not climb to the sky here. They are humble, two-family homes holding their ground against the encroaching shadows of co-ops and condominiums. The people, they are kind but loud, their voices rising with the blare of car radios, engines roaring like beasts unchained, rousing the slumbering dawn.\n\nAs night falls, tread with caution. Bensonhurst is safe, mostly, but the heart of man is a mystery. Trouble lurks in the guise of youth and thieves, shadows that once found me and left their mark. Packages vanish as if by magic, spirited away by unseen hands. And then there is the matter of dogs, their leavings a blight on the streets. It is the law here to clean after them, but the law is a whisper in the wind, often unheard. Daily, the waste litters the path to the train, to the market, a constant companion to the wary traveler. Tread carefully, lest your soles carry the stain of this place.",
            "The first thing you must grasp about Portland, Oregon is the notion of \"weird.\" A phrase scrawled across the backside of a building that stands as a pizza parlor, a bar, a music stage, a den of undress, and skirts the fringes of law like a thin veil, shouts \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it whispers of a bygone era, the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, less known and less dear, where subcultures bloomed like wildflowers in the cracks of pavement. To others, it's a siren's call, beckoning to those who wear their oddities as a badge of honor. Despite the flood of well-heeled Californians and the ceaseless rise of condominiums to shelter them, Portland remains in its peculiar embrace. Yet, weird does not always dance with acceptance, though it opens its arms to the unaccepted. It does not mean we shun the trappings of the modern age or the battles it brings. Like the rest of the land, our goods bear the mark of distant shores. A million shades of weirdness, each hue not quite normal, yet Portland wears its normalcy too: yoga and hipsters and suits of business. Perhaps weird means we hold all this with a lighter heart. In my corner of this city, as in many others, houses boast colors bright, gardens spill with blooms and herbs and vegetables, and the sidewalks are lined with free boxes when summer reigns. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold treasures discarded yet perfect, waiting for the right soul to pass by. A book, a garment, or anything at all might lie within. This magical chance of a stroll through a Southeast neighborhood captures the essence of Portland as I see it, though I am but one among the myriad shades of weird. Some neighbors would not dream of plucking their attire from a sidewalk box. They seek out goat yoga—yes, yoga amidst live goats—or rally their voices at Timbers matches, cheering the city's soccer heroes. Portland brims with souls bound to their passions, some chasing dreams, others dreaming amid the bar’s embrace. Ours is a city with a drug scourge, often rooted deep in the mind’s struggles, the relentless rain and brooding clouds a possible accomplice. Homelessness casts a long shadow, a riddle unsolved. Drawn here by social services more generous than most lands, yet still they fall short. The rest of us sway between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not so strange at all.",
            "The mountains stood eternal, witness to the sun's ancient journey, keeping their vigil in the north. They did not waver, unmoved by the clamor of life, while I, lost in the pursuits of my days, often forgot them. Yet they were always there, demanding to be seen when the weight of the world bore down upon me. I would turn to them, find solace in their stoic presence, and gather strength to carry on, a day at a time. \n\nWhen I first came to this place for my studies, it was those mountains north of the campus that seized my heart. The university had its own charms—grand buildings, tranquil ponds, and whispering trees—but the mountains reigned supreme, an unyielding king. The town itself held beauty, a tapestry of small cafés where time slipped by in caffeine-fueled marathons of study. A few steps more, and the downtown embraced you with its echo of ages, the faded bricks lining the streets, a testament to time's passage. Here, this quiet town found its pulse, a brief surge of city life in the midst of its suburban calm. But the chaos did not stretch far, and beyond the library lay the quiet refuge of small-town peace.\n\nThis city, with its shifting moods, beckoned exploration, each corner a memory waiting to be made. Strolls past the rusty swings in the park after nights without sleep, or dashing through the bustling streets to catch a show at the theater, tickets courtesy of the university. But as with all places, it bore its share of sorrow. The ponds, mirrors of the soul, offered refuge in moments of introspection and tears, the moon high and the hour late, as life's questions loomed large. Watching the birds and insects go about their business, I pondered my place, adrift in the enigma of existence.\n\nAnd so, I wandered past the ponds, past the park, through the neighborhoods with their quiet houses, until I reached the main road. There the sun cast its radiant light upon the palms, painting the sky in hues of dawn. I realized my steps had led me northward. And there they were, as ever, the mountains, brushing the hazy sky with their grandeur. In their silent counsel, I found my resolve, steadfast as the mountains themselves.",
            "You might pass it by, not seeing it at first. It's just a residential area behind a row of shops, a place not much thought of for living. Not for most anyway. But if you wander past the deserted Whole Foods, past the hotels that fill only once a year save for the summer's brief gatherings of kin, you'll find a lively enclave hidden there. On these streets, lined up like those Russian dolls, each apartment block is set down one beside the other, a careful and deliberate array. The first buildings you come to have held stories in the news, tales not fit for repeating, so we'll leave them in their shadows. But beyond them lies another realm, one few know of. Across the street, a quiet campus for a community college stands, a sleepy bastion where students arrive, coffee in hand, stifling yawns in the early hours to start their long days. The iron gates groan wide to let them through, while the commuters grumble in their cars, fists shaking at the delay when the crowd grows thick. The road bends into another, lined with homes, where a park lies on one side and a center for healing broken bones on the other. The rehab place has its porch set with cheerful seats and a fan that churns slowly in the summer's heavy air. Children dash through the park's grass, spinning and laughing among the flowers where bees drone lazily. Elderly folk walk dogs, frowning at the skaters, nodding with a kind of knowing to the girls who whisper secrets by the swings. A strip mall by the park holds a sushi place, never quite busy, and you’ll find a shop for pool supplies and a nail salon beside it, snug and unassuming. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, and eat hibachi all at once—such is the charm of these small-town malls. A frozen yogurt shop is there as well, the kind where you serve yourself, and you’ll see the teens at the park with their cold, dripping cups, doing tricks on skateboards, puffing clouds of vapor, the picture of what they think is cool. This neighborhood, it's a slice of old America, a piece of the quiet South where time seems to stand still and little ever changes.",
            "The neighborhood stands as a relic of another era, where the American dream was once a tangible thing. Houses line the streets, mostly single-family dwellings, but there are those split in two, attached as if in some forgotten symbiosis. My own home sits with a small yard before it, a humble driveway to its side, an echo of a time when the suburbs embraced this nation, now distant and drawing away. Yet this place remains, whispering the dream still breathes, and we clutch at it with the last of our strength.\n\nThe optimism that once painted the faces of the people fades like old photographs. The little yards no longer kept with the same pride, but still, cars rest in the driveways, and the children play as if the world beyond their laughter were nothing but a distant dream. The old school, standing nearly ninety years, seems to hold the future in its walls, a vessel of nostalgia for the elders who pass by. Churches stand few and far between, their pews empty, but the courts where basketballs echo are never silent.\n\nEach house wears a different face yet shares the same soul. A large market, Super \"A,\" held by a Yemeni family, perhaps the sole Arab roots in this soil. The majority here are African American, their stories woven into the fabric of this place. Streets wide and welcoming, where kids play their games, momentarily pausing for the passing cars. Generations have settled here, telling tales of a time when every neighbor was a friend.\n\nOnce there was a karate school. When Hollywood ceased to spin tales of karate kids, the children turned away, and now it stands as a pharmacy, the promise that pills can mend what ails you. A small movie theater clings to life, showing old films at a price the young deem unworthy, but the elders find solace in its dim light, escaping the clamor of youthful ambition.\n\nThe expressway cuts through the town, though its access lies elsewhere. There was a time when a petition called for an exit here, the young cried for it, but the elders held firm in their refusal, fearing it would rend the fabric of their home. A new high school rises, and with it, the debate over a mascot. A cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin, a fitting emblem for this place that straddles the past and the future with a foot in each.",
            "In the sprawling city where I dwell, the neighborhood is a patchwork of lives and places, a mosaic of humanity's ventures. Houses and homes scattered among the commerce of life, as if cast by the hand of some indifferent god. Offices stand beside stores and eateries, theaters of delights and distractions. There is always a new table to lay one's troubles upon or a shop to wander through, seeking what one does not know one seeks. The grand emporiums, names known and whispered across lands, stand shoulder to shoulder with small sanctuaries of goods, boutiques that speak in softer tones and beckon the passerby. They line the thoroughfares, these establishments, and their presence brings a hum to the quarters that would otherwise nest in silence.\n\nThe parks are not far, green havens where mothers and fathers bring their young to bask in the innocence of play. And the people, oh, the people, they are of every kind. Here is a place where the colors of the world mix and mingle, a tapestry woven with threads of many origins. The pride of the LGBTQ+ lives alongside the solemnity of the Orthodox Jew, and the echoes of the Soviet Union find refuge here. Beyond, the city stretches, each enclave a world unto itself, Korea, China, Armenia, and more, each a testament to the journeys of the soul.\n\nBut the roads are long, and the hours pass slowly in the confines of the steel chariots that crawl upon them. A journey of mere miles becomes an odyssey, and the feet of men grow idle. The city sprawls wide, and the habit of walking has withered under the weight of time and distance. Our streets, they are burdened with the ceaseless flow of traffic, a river of iron that knows no peace, and the finding of a place to rest one's vehicle is a quest unto itself.\n\nYet still they come, the builders with their dreams of towering abodes, casting shadows upon the land. A place of allure, yet the hearts of those who dwell here grow weary at the thought of more souls, more wheels upon the roads. The homes are as varied as the people, from grand dwellings to humble abodes, each a story in itself, each a shelter from the world’s chaos. Here families find their refuge, and here, in the quiet corners, the children once played, their laughter a balm against the solitude of the city.\n\nI know not the faces of most who share this place with me. The bonds that once tied us close have slackened, though in the memory of youth, I recall the days when we were kin, neighbors whose doors were always open. Those were the days of sunlight and simplicity, when the world was small and kind.",
            "Where is everything? she asked from the seat beside me, her eyes wide as we drove through the endless stretch of cornfields that framed the world. This is it, I replied, a wry smile on my lips, knowing full well her disbelief in the vacancy of the land. She hailed from a town where a grocery store lay just a stone's throw from her doorstep, where wide-open spaces were a rarity, a myth. But here, amidst the vastness, I unfolded the story of my upbringing in rural Ohio, and in that telling, she began to see the roots that held me. Down that narrow country road, past the fields and the sunlit quarry brimming with water, lay the small enclave where I was born and raised. The houses stood firm in brick and stucco, each claiming half an acre or more, every bit of land a testament to the pride of its keeper. Come spring, flowers burst forth in riotous color, and the trees, ever loyal to the seasons, donned their changing garb. In the driveways, Mercedes Benz cars gleamed, freshly baptized by the hose, their surfaces a mirror to the midday sun. As we neared my gray stucco house, my Korean neighbor waved, his face a map of kindness. He spent his days under the sky, the grass his canvas, and his mower his brush, a song rising above its mechanical drone. We all found joy in his tune, a melody of sincerity, and the stories of his past. Once a doctor, now a part of the landscape, he rode his John Deere as if it were an extension of himself. And finally, my home. In the side yard, the geese gathered, scattering before the exuberant chase of our Terrier. Beyond the house, a stream meandered, singing its quiet song as it flowed toward the quarry. Bullfrogs joined the chorus, their calls mingling with the distant lowing of cattle. Across a bridge crafted by hand, an untouched sanctuary waited, where trees grew wild and herbs and flowers bloomed without hindrance. Here was my realm of childhood, a place of forts built high in branches, of imagined hunts where the chase was the thrill. Always some child nearby, ready to join in the adventure. Winters brought a cold that bit deep, yet with it came a beauty unmatched. The land transformed, the vibrant hues of summer giving way to stark silhouettes of trees, their limbs bare against the sky. Snow, when it came, cloaked everything in silence, a wonderland in white. My sister and I, adversaries in play, took to snowballs as our chosen arms, constructing forts of snow and branch to hold our arsenal. In that frozen world, we found our freedom, children unburdened by the weight of years, lost in the simple joy of being."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies my small town in Michigan, where the old roads meander through farmland and spill into quaint tourist cities. There are no sprawling malls or neon-lit Walmarts, no Targets or even an Applebee’s to speak of. The places you might need lie far off, and travel is a necessity. Yet, despite this, I find myself amidst a beauty unparalleled, encircled by the waters that have cradled this land. My town, if it can be called so, is a peninsula gripped by the arms of Lake Michigan on one flank and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Shores abound where one might wander and feel the cool kiss of the lake upon their feet.\n\nThe neighborhood I call home breathes the essence of small-town life. Houses stand solitary, each with its own story, not replicas of one another, but elder structures, some renewed, others bearing the weight of years. Basements lie beneath, full and visible from the roads that wind by. Aluminum siding clings to many, weathered and strong, and the color of the homes is a patchwork quilt that encircles my own. Yards stretch out before them, where children play upon trampolines and swingsets, where gardens grow and fences keep watch over the creatures within. It is Middle America, a testament to the toils of those who live within its boundaries, raising their kin or having done so.\n\nThe streets are alive with the laughter of children, the steady rhythm of bikes and rollerblades, the soft pad of dogs led by their masters. Neighbors nod in recognition, aware of who belongs and who is a stranger. A wave from a grill, a smile from a passerby with their dog, are the currency of this place. Lawns are tended with care, green and trim, free from the decay of autumn leaves. Plants and bushes stand in neat array, pruned and orderly. It is not a neighborhood that daunts with grandeur but one that whispers of solace and family, of quiet and safety. It is an average place made exceptional by the promise it holds—a sanctuary at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s department keeps vigil, and the health department stands in its shadow. The city recycling center lies just beyond, a hub for the surrounding folk. Baseball and softball fields echo with the voices of announcers and the names of players, and beside them, a small-town airport sends its planes skyward, their engines a low rumble in the air. Ice cream is within reach, a sweet reward at the end of a walk, and downtown beckons from a distance. My children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks away, a testament to the spirit of this place. It is a good place to call home.",
            "In the place where I call home, the landscape is a tapestry of sameness, each thread meticulously placed by the unseen hand of the homeowners' association. Upon crossing the threshold into this suburban sprawl, you are met with a parade of houses, each a mirror to the next, their facades pristine and unyielding. The lawns are kept in a neat patchwork of green, sprinkled with stones for ornament, and short driveways lead to garages built for two. Here and there, a tree stands sentinel, a modest testament to nature’s incursion.\n\nThe roads, freshly paved, snake through this enclave of the ordinary, unmarred by potholes or the scars of time, a testament to the diligence of those who see to such matters. The homes stand mostly single-storied, though some dare to reach higher, their windows like eyes watching the quiet streets. Gone are the solitary mailboxes that once marked each plot; in their stead, a cluster waits at the street’s end, keys clinking in locks as neighbors retrieve their mail and packages from the shared boxes—a nod to the unyielding quest for uniformity.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, this neighborhood is a strange blend of the rural and the suburban, sprawling across ample land. Community pools lie behind gates, inviting yet untroubled, while paths wind through the area, offering solace to those who walk their dogs or seek solitude in the fading light. Parks are unnecessary here; the neighborhood itself is vast enough for any runner’s ambition.\n\nRetirees make up the bulk of this community, eyes watching out for one another, bringing a sense of safety that wraps around you like a well-worn coat. But among them, younger faces emerge—professionals who have found a place here, amidst the quiet.\n\nThe city itself looms larger in number than in spirit, a place where the pulse of a small town beats beneath the skin of a bustling populace. There’s a mall, modest in its offerings but sufficient to the needs of those who wander through its halls. Fifteen minutes is the measure of the distance to the heart of commerce, where stores line the streets, each a promise of goods, from the finest organic markets to the stark shelves of discount outlets.\n\nThis neighborhood is a haven of safety and order, with pools to cool the heat of summer and trails that wind like thoughts through the terrain. And though the shops lie further afield, a short drive delivers you to the doors of any chain you desire, convenience a mere engine's purr away.",
            "I first learned of my dwelling through a podcast about the vanished. Surprising in its own right. This place where apartments fetch a thousand a month and yet tales of the lost lingered unknown. Neither I nor my friends knew of such stories. Perhaps it's the struggle. Some nights, friends weep themselves into restless sleep. The cost of living steep, yet frugality's been our teacher over the years. The scent of flea market relics and mothballed garments becomes familiar, almost comforting. The smells of adulthood, subdued in their presence, cling to you like a second skin. Smoking or simply accustomed, you find the flea market's essence undeniable. Dusty magazines on a silent piano. The scent burrows into leather, stubborn against washing. Here, three thrift stores lie within steps. Start at the far end, wander through charity thrifts, past a library, a rare book shop, and a store of curiosities. Downtown, dense with life, cars and people throng the streets, yet within the thrift's walls, silence prevails. The perfect refuge for an afternoon adrift. Each year, more souls flood the city. A city swelling under the weight of its own burgeoning empire. A place reminiscent of New York, where people pursue their own paths, seldom asking of you. Alone, a quiet independence respected. Not like the South, where curiosity signals care. Here, lives remain unprobed, shells intact as the city ebbs and flows like tides. A place alive, between the pianist next door and the singers above. Strangers in apartments become a community. Needs met, birthdays marked, funerals mourned, aid given. Fortunate to be here, neighbors kind and well-meaning. I return the favor, tidying after myself, sharing food. Mail exchanged. A pleasure to see them, and perhaps they think the same of me. In this vast, impersonal sprawl, it's the neighbors who make it feel less like ruin.",
            "In a small town nestled in the Midwest, there lies the edge of the world, just beyond the reach of the city where the sprawling suburbs give way to a more modest existence. The neighborhood where I dwell stands on the eastern fringe, marked by economic struggle and homes that wear the years in their sagging frames. Low the worth of these lands, where tenants and owners alike count their pennies, yet there is a beauty that resists the sum of its parts. The people who pass by offer a nod, a greeting, their faces lined with stories untold. \n\nCrime has its own dance here, a little more frequent than in other quarters, yet it does not overshadow the day. Tales of violence linger in the air, whispers of past years where blood was spilled not far from where I lay my head. Our next-door neighbors, they lost a son to the night outside a bar where shadows stretch long. But fortune has spared us the worst, our losses confined to what the porch could not guard.\n\nThe town itself bears the scars of a different war, the kind fought with needles and pills. The scourge of opioids, fentanyl a ghostly reaper, has claimed many souls. Yet even in this, there is a battle waged, with centers for healing and hands that train others to bring back the lost from the brink.\n\nAmidst these trials, light finds its way. My son attends a school where the halls hum with a kindness that shields him from life's cruelties. The teachers there, the staff, they are a beacon, and the boy thrives in their care. The community gathers, a PTO that breathes life into the year with events that bind us all together. In a town where poverty stalks one in five, the school offers its children meals freely, a stand against hunger. No child there feels the weight of what they cannot pay.\n\nThe city fathers have turned their gaze to the heart of the town, paving roads, tending to the green, yet the east where I dwell remains a shadow in their plans. The center thrives, the west bustles with commerce, but here on the eastern edge, we wait for the light to reach us.\n\nStill, this town is home. Its people, its schools, the shops that line its streets, they meet our needs. The house we call ours may not boast of wealth, but it holds comfort, and that is its own treasure. Sixteen years we have stood upon this soil, and in our hearts, there lies no desire to be elsewhere.",
            "In the heart of the city stands a neighborhood steeped in tales of its own, perched upon a hill and hemmed in by the memories of structures long past. I dwell in a seven-story apartment, a lone sentinel across from the old theater where once voices soared and stories unfurled. Down the slope, a block away, lies a curious haunt, an arcade bar, where souls converge in the sultry throes of summer nights. June and July see them in clusters, a line snaking along the pavement, each waiting for a moment inside. Not far, the city park sprawls wide, a rare expanse of green amid the urban sprawl. Concrete girds it and stairs run steep, carved into the earth like secrets kept. When winter's breath bites, the homeless come, pitching tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk, the wide steps their refuge. Snow is scarce, but the rain comes relentless, a deluge that chills bones and spirits alike. They huddle close, seeking warmth in the city's core, not far from the family center where solace might be found, a chance to wash away the grime of wandering. But it is not these things that bind me to this place. It is not the grandeur of the past, nor the elegance of architecture that graces the hillsides sloping to the sea. What I cherish is the spirit of the people, the tapestry of lives woven through Hilltop. Once, it was a name spoken in fear, a haven for violence that painted the West Coast red. Stories linger still, whispers of the DEA and federal might sweeping through like a cleansing wind. The people remember, passing tales from one generation to the next, even to newcomers like myself. They toil in earnest, striving to shed the past, to nurture their streets with care and pride. Some say it's unwise to walk Hilltop by night if you're white, a caution rooted in bygone days and the bitter tang of prejudice. Yet, perhaps I tread unnoticed, just dark enough to blend, or maybe Hilltop sees in me a kindred soul, one who knows the weight of history that bears down upon us all. In a city that should be a mosaic of cultures, the old wounds still fester. But the Hilltop is my heart. Walking those streets under the cloak of night, I find life there, a kinship with people more likely to offer a coat than ill intent. It's a place where laundromat lights linger longer for a phone to find power, where I've sat shrouded in the night’s chill, only to be seen, handed a token of humanity, and told I am beautiful and worth something.",
            "I came to this place on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world was as uncertain as the shadows cast by the old elms at dusk. It was not easy to find kin in those early days. Yet I found myself drawn close to a lad who dwelt two doors down and another who lived along the same winding street. Those boys are gone now, their laughter and companionship scattered to the winds, but the echoes of our time remain etched into the fabric of this place. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived are still here, their lives woven into the quiet tapestry of this American suburb.\n\nThe houses here stand two stories tall, their facades reflecting the sameness of the world in which they stand. On warm days, the voices of children thread through the air, a symphony of innocence and joy. But for the most part, silence reigns here, and I have never found cause for discord among these neighbors. Solitude is a gift in this place, until the hour comes when you seek the hands of others. Packages arrive at my door, untouched by the specter of theft, and I find a strange solace in this trust.\n\nA park lies a stone’s throw from my door, a realm of memories both cherished and unwelcome. There I have played games of sport, felt the sting of a wayward elbow upon my nose, yet the warmth of camaraderie overshadows such fleeting pain. Nowadays, when my feet tread that familiar ground, it is with my cousin’s young ones, their delight in the swings and slides a balm for nostalgia's ache.\n\nThis neighborhood is a patchwork of souls and stories, diverse as the flavors that linger in the air. Within a mile's stride, one finds the spices of China, India, Mexico, and Italy. Yet the folk here often summon their meals through the ether, with apps like GrubHub and DoorDash delivering sustenance to their doors. The fast-food joints hold sway, as they do in many suburbs, their lights a beacon of sameness. Yet there is variety to be found, even an Indian-owned store that beckons with promises of distant lands.\n\nThe shops here are a bounty of necessity and indulgence, from dry cleaners to pharmacies, and the Jewel-Osco, a staple of the Midwest. This place, with its quiet streets and whispers of wind, has become a refuge. Tales from the world beyond, tales of strife and neighborly woe, serve only to deepen my gratitude for the peace I find here.",
            "The world as I find it lies close by the college where I spend my days, and I take some solace in that fact. The landscape is dotted with apartment blocks and the occasional refuge of dining and drink, places that offer a modicum of diversion without too severe a toll on the pocket. A certain tavern recently took on a new name and with it a heftier price, though the spirits and service could be worse. Folks here are largely amiable. They are students or else of modest means, drawn by the low rents. Children abound, their laughter mingling with the breeze from the nearby school. I keep to my own and have no need for the company of neighbors. They indulge in the smoke that clouds the halls, prompting management to install an air freshener outside their door, an action that my companion and I find near comical in its futility. \n\nThe buildings carry the weight of years in their visage though some hide modern interiors. Down the way, new homes rise, hollow in construction yet dressed in high rents, a charade tolerated due to their nearness to the campus. A mere five minutes’ walk finds a cheap eatery where food, served on paper, emerges from the hum of microwaves. Across the street stands a gas station, its reputation as an employer poor. Yet, the city’s hand has touched the road, granting it a fresh face with wide sidewalks and green spaces, an attempt at grace amidst decay. My own dwelling is cushioned by trees, though some have fallen to the axe, leaving behind stumps, reminders of what once was. Behind the apartment lies another street, less cared for, its walkways crumbling, its buildings weary. Trees line the avenue, perhaps to veil the neglect beneath. \n\nCrime is whispered of, particularly from a complex down yonder, though it is not alone in such tales. Across from my own abode, shadows flit through a transient populace, but I find contentment here. It suits my purse, and the conveniences are many—the university a short walk, the buses ready to carry me to the market or into the heart of the town.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawled beneath the wide and endless sky, where duplexes stood in quiet formation along the cul-de-sac, each painted in the same sun-drenched yellow with white porches and roofs of green metal. They seemed to stand as solitary houses, scattered like memories of another time. In the evenings, we gather, a cluster of souls at the end of a driveway not marked by plan or intent, while children spin their worlds in colored chalk and kites that strain against the tethering earth. It is a breath of yesterday in a world too quickened by machines and screens. The fields stretch wide around us, wrapped in the arms of trees, the sky above a canvas of blue and cloud, and yet there is a shadow that leans upon the land.  \n\nIn this season, the air is thick with the threat of storms, and last night the sirens rose, their wail cutting through the stillness, driving us to shelter. I found myself ensconced in the narrow womb of the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, a purse, a few pillows. The large dog refused the sanctuary of the bathroom, pacing and barking in the living room, unsettled by the strangeness of the hour. Outside, the world was silent save for the hammer of hail upon the earth, the neighborhood hushed in anticipation.  \n\nWhen the storm had passed, the road was a river of steam, the heat of the day fleeing before the sudden coolness. The temperature had fallen like a stone, the hail melting as it met the hot ground. I looked up, and the sky was clearing, the sun breaking through to paint a double rainbow across the heavens. I ran inside, fetched my camera, capturing the moment to share with kin and friends far distant, their awe echoing my own.  \n\nThe streets remained still for a time, until the people returned from where they had sought refuge, the rhythm of life resuming its gentle cadence. Mothers and children emerged, the scent of cooking meals drifting on the air. It is a place of warmth and welcome to this stranger from the north, where the voices are wrapped in the soft music of the southern drawl.  \n\nMy dwelling is like all the others, two bedrooms, two baths, though within each lies its own secret, some small, some spacious, a mystery of design. I find solace in the great field behind, where a path winds to a pond not meant for swimming, a place where deer wander and the bullfrog sings his morning song. It is a sanctuary, just beyond the city's reach, where each dawn is heralded by the crow of roosters, the farms that border our small enclave. And in the evening, the bray of a donkey calls out from a nearby farm, a voice in the gathering dusk. This place, this hidden gem of a neighborhood, has offered me its quiet grace.",
            "In the ten years I've wandered this patch of earth, there's been a reckonin' of sorts within me. When first my feet set upon this ground, I was adrift in sorrow. Riverdale lay behind, its memory a shadow clinging close. My tears fell, for I left behind kin and land I loved. But my mama and papa sought a better place, a place where my sister and I could grow like saplings unbent by the wind, in a house they deemed fit for us, in a school unmarred by the ghetto's whisper. \n\nTime, that old relentless river, carried me forward. In its flow, I found companions and foes, both. Of the neighbors, I came to know but a few. Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis, they were all in the circle of my knowing. They've been a solace, almost kin, and for that, I hold them dear. I recall, clear as day, the time when we all went to see Mr. Glen wed anew. It was a day of lightness, a day to dream of for my own future, of a life wrought in gold for some bride to be. When Miss Veda cast her garter into the air, it was I who caught it, though the flowers escaped my grasp. We danced beneath the stars, and I took joy with Marsharii, his daughter, a fleeting presence whose path I hope has led to grander things.\n\nThe streets here wind like a labyrinth, though now with the guide of a GPS, I find time to wander. My feet have carried me as far as they dared with Kason and Curtis at my side. We, who spent our days lost in games and laughter, living each moment as if it were our last. The park calls to me often, a balm for my spirit, offering solace beneath its boughs. There, among the trees, I find my balance with sticks from the depot, wielding my bokken like a samurai of old.\n\nCourts for tennis and basketball stand silent, though they remember the sweat and toil of our games. My father, alongside Mr. Graves, taught us the ways of tennis, and in their training, we found joy. Yes, this place has held many moments of delight, tales etched in the fabric of my being. Yet still, I sense the horizon holds more, a promise of the best yet to unfurl.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies Johnston, a town that whispers its own tales. It's not a place that strikes one as distinct, yet it holds its ground in the world of agriculture. They call it the Peach Capital of the World, a claim that stands bold against the sky on the town’s sign. Fields stretch wide, a patchwork of peach trees and cattle pastures, the land breathing in the sun's relentless gaze. Houses, those not within the town's narrow heart, scatter themselves across the countryside. Some rise two stories high, capped with metal against the summer blaze or clad in gray shingles. They sit back from the road, granting the front fields to animals or crops as though in quiet homage to the land.\n\nIn the town's core, a lone stoplight sways above the crossroads, marking the hub of commerce. A triad of eateries offers solace to the hungry traveler: Hong Kong, a small Chinese enclave run by one family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary’s, a humble burger joint. The pizzeria shuttered its doors not long ago, leaving its absence to echo in the town’s memory. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family pharmacy, finds renown not for its pills but for the Cherry Coca-Cola that bubbles within its walls. Then there’s the IGA, a grocery store both small and dear, where shoppers pick up just a thing or two before heading to the Walmart yonder in Batesburg-Leesville.\n\nDollar General stands as the town's beacon, its shelves laden with the essentials of everyday life, bustling from dawn till dusk. Nearby, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a woman known to all, has stood for a generation. Two men work there, delivering sofas and tables to those who call the town home. Attached is Clark’s Cuts and Kennels, where pets are groomed and tended, their services a comfort to the residents.\n\nA doctor and a veterinarian offer their care on the outskirts, small practices but sufficient. Johnston Elementary holds the town's children until fifth grade, after which they venture to the next town for further schooling. There’s talk of a park, 2.5 acres of promise, where families might gather and outsiders be drawn. For now, the town offers no theaters, no alleys for bowling, no places for idle gathering. But in its quiet, Johnston holds a charm, fleeting as it may be, that lingers even as one passes through, perhaps without noticing at all.",
            "In the small southern town of Tennessee where I live, there's a street that runs between two state highways, drawing more traffic than one might hope for. The neighborhood otherwise drifts in a quiet repose. Folks are settled here, not much coming and going. Faces familiar in the way of old photographs. The people tend to their yards, the rhythm of daily chores marking time. In winter, the children sled down the hill on the side street, laughter echoing in the brittle air. Our house stands at the corner, a sentinel to the comings and goings, and we've grown acquainted with the cars that pass. A strange vehicle catches the eye, a note taken. Neighbors walk for exercise or with their dogs, children pedal their bikes, the usual dance of suburb life. We stay home often, working from the house, my wife and I, and our two daughters, eleven and fourteen. Our presence as much a fixture as the old oak at the edge of the yard. We play outside, even when the rain falls. Sometimes we grill on the back deck, the scent of barbecue a comfort and a call. The sound of lawn mowers is a constant from March to October, when the grass finally yields. The neighborhood is shaded by trees, remnants of the wood that once stood here, and in Fall, leaves carpet the ground, demanding rake and flame. The smell of burning leaves is a harbinger of the season's turn. Winter has grown mild, a long Fall stretching its fingers over the months. Our garage sits at the back, rendering the front door nearly forgotten. When I work on my truck or other projects with the garage doors thrown open, I feel a part of the neighborhood's pulse. Holidays bring a hush over the street, Thanksgiving drawing families together, cars lining the curbs with out-of-town plates. It's the same for Mother's Day, for Christmas. This place is home, settled in the bones. If only it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "In the barren expanse of the high desert where the land stretches out with a relentless constancy of dirt and more dirt and where the horizon is a line of ochre and dust, my neighborhood stands. The brown earth is ever-present, a constant reminder of the sun’s relentless gaze, and where a green lawn emerges it speaks to the wealth of water spent in its keeping. Back in the nineties, the houses lay scattered across the landscape, distant as stars in a vast sky. Now they grow closer, like the slow encroachment of civilization upon a forgotten land, and the city creeps into being with each passing day, a reflection of change echoed in many places.\n\nThe folk here are kind enough, old faces with gentle smiles, and the neighborhood is good, or so it seems, as places go. Chain stores pepper the streets, Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, but for anything finer, the kind that speaks to luxury, you must travel far. Whole Foods and such are strangers to this dust-choked realm. The work that calls most is construction, the skeletal rise of buildings in the open spaces that still linger, and it unnerves me to think of what may come. I left the city once and have no wish to return to its clamor. My own trade is in the craft of walls and ceilings, a labor of hands shaping spaces.\n\nYet there is a beauty here in the starkness, a draw that pulls people to the high desert, a wilderness forged by harsh climate and rugged topography, a home to creatures that wander this arid land. We, who dwell here, must learn to share this place with them, these non-human neighbors, and find a way to live side by side. My family and I, we have made peace with the wild. My children, three in number, chase lizards and insects beneath the sun’s glare, their laughter echoing in the dusty air.\n\nFor those who seek diversion, Victorville offers its own charm, a place where families may find the desert’s heart. The annual San Bernardino County Fair brings its own brand of joy, a blend of tradition and revelry. Venture to Wrightwood to witness snow upon the peaks, to feel the cold bite and perhaps learn the art of winter’s sport. The Victor Valley Museum stands as a testament to the land’s history, with relics of stone and bone, the artifacts of those who walked before us, and the stories of industry and life in this place called Victorville.",
            "When I think on where I live, the truth of it is a place set apart from those who dwell in houses with yards and picket fences. A place that is not a place in the sense of possession but in the sense of habitation. The college campus is the land I call home, and the dormitory my house, and the souls who occupy it my kin. The sprawl of the campus reaches out like a township, its bounds and borders dissolving into the world beyond. Yet for all its peculiarity, it is a neighborhood not unlike any other. There are structures and there are people, there are places to gather and to dwell, places to buy and places to play.\n\nLet us speak of the structures first. There are the apartments, small and clustered, where two to four souls share a room, and the floors stack upon each other like strata of rock in the earth, two deep, housing twenty lives or more. There are the houses, rare and scattered, for those tied to the institution in ways more permanent, alumni who dwell in the past and present all at once. And there are the dormitories, vast and teeming, where hundreds find shelter, two by two, under a single roof. This is the lay of the land.\n\nNow to the people. The school boasts of its diversity, and in truth it is a tapestry of cultures and ages, woven together in this place. The staff inhabit the scattered houses, the young ones fill the dormitories, and the elder students find a home in the apartments. But words alone cannot capture the essence of these people, and so we move on to speak of the stores and parks.\n\nWithin this self-contained world are the places of commerce, the dining halls and shops that bear the school's own mark. All that one seeks can be found within these confines. And there is a park, a common ground where all meet, kept clean and safe by the hands of those who call this place home. A playground for the diverse populace, a testament to the care of the community.\n\nThis then is my neighborhood, a place both peculiar and familiar, a microcosm of life in all its forms.",
            "There are no sidewalks where I live. The land slopes down as if the earth itself is weary, and my house perches atop the steepest hill in the neighborhood. They call it the \"work out hill,\" this incline where joggers labor in their ascent, their footsteps echoing on the hard, unyielding road. The street is a patchwork of pitted asphalt, a test for tires and nerves alike. Overhead, the wires dangle, a tangled web of electric and telephone lines, tattered by storm and time. The rain comes often, a relentless visitor that lashes the trees and tears at the power lines, leaving them mended in a checkered mosaic of repairs.\n\nTall evergreens stand sentinel, their presence a source of contention among the people who live here. They cut them down when they can, these trees that dare obscure the vista of the ocean. The houses climb the hill, glass-fronted and defiant, each seeking the horizon where the bay meets the sky. At sunset the water ignites with an inner flame, the sky a canvas of orange, but more often than not, clouds loom heavy, and the sun's light is but a ghostly glow through the mist. The days are gray, the air heavy with moisture. Moss claims its dominion over roofs, cars, railings, anything it can grasp. I left my car in the driveway for a month, and when I returned it was a green beast, furred with moss, and it took three hours of scraping to see it shine again.\n\nChildren are scarce in these parts, though a school stands not far off. The neighborhood is a haven for the old, the retired, lives lived in quiet rhythm. Dogs replace the laughter of children, and they roam the yards and chase one another down the street. Leave a door ajar, and you might find one in your living room, a trespasser to be gently shooed away. Rabbits abound, burrowing and rooting, much to the gardeners' despair, yet my cats delight in them, their presence an invitation to hunt. The birds come too, sparrows and hummingbirds flitting among the branches, while hawks and eagles circle until the crows rally to drive them away.\n\nThere are no stores here, but down the hill where the land meets the sea lie a few restaurants, their offerings of fresh seafood a draw to the weary traveler. The shore is rocky, no beach to speak of, only stones to cast into the bay. The water is not wide; you can see the land across, a faint outline even through the ever-present mist.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, if your compass is set for Bensonhurst, you'd find no travail in reaching it. The veins of the city, the subways and buses, carry the echo of a metropolis that never sleeps. Bensonhurst stands a testament to the very heart of New York City. As you tread these streets, be prepared for the sight of Asian emporiums that seem to have sprung as if by some invisible hand. Two decades past, a tide of Asian souls found harbor here, and now their presence marks every block with stores like sentinels in a foreign land. Supermarkets and laundromats, their windows ablaze with neon, call out with the promise of sustenance and cleanliness. The food is good and costs less, a siren’s song for the thrifty. Close by, where I reside, four such markets lie within but a two-minute stroll, a testament to the ease of life’s provisions here.\n\nYet do not think Bensonhurst solely a canvas painted in Asian hues. No, it is a mosaic of the world, a gathering of immigrants and their progeny, a tapestry of first and second-generation Americans. Still, the Asian influence is strong, their hands guiding the most prominent of ventures. Nearby, a park lies renewed, a paradise of play with its courts and fields, swings and fountains where children find joy in the summer’s heat. Diversity reigns here, a harmony of tongues and hues, united in the dance of sport and leisure.\n\nBuildings do not climb to the sky here. They are humble, two-family homes holding their ground against the encroaching shadows of co-ops and condominiums. The people, they are kind but loud, their voices rising with the blare of car radios, engines roaring like beasts unchained, rousing the slumbering dawn.\n\nAs night falls, tread with caution. Bensonhurst is safe, mostly, but the heart of man is a mystery. Trouble lurks in the guise of youth and thieves, shadows that once found me and left their mark. Packages vanish as if by magic, spirited away by unseen hands. And then there is the matter of dogs, their leavings a blight on the streets. It is the law here to clean after them, but the law is a whisper in the wind, often unheard. Daily, the waste litters the path to the train, to the market, a constant companion to the wary traveler. Tread carefully, lest your soles carry the stain of this place.",
            "The first thing you must grasp about Portland, Oregon is the notion of \"weird.\" A phrase scrawled across the backside of a building that stands as a pizza parlor, a bar, a music stage, a den of undress, and skirts the fringes of law like a thin veil, shouts \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it whispers of a bygone era, the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, less known and less dear, where subcultures bloomed like wildflowers in the cracks of pavement. To others, it's a siren's call, beckoning to those who wear their oddities as a badge of honor. Despite the flood of well-heeled Californians and the ceaseless rise of condominiums to shelter them, Portland remains in its peculiar embrace. Yet, weird does not always dance with acceptance, though it opens its arms to the unaccepted. It does not mean we shun the trappings of the modern age or the battles it brings. Like the rest of the land, our goods bear the mark of distant shores. A million shades of weirdness, each hue not quite normal, yet Portland wears its normalcy too: yoga and hipsters and suits of business. Perhaps weird means we hold all this with a lighter heart. In my corner of this city, as in many others, houses boast colors bright, gardens spill with blooms and herbs and vegetables, and the sidewalks are lined with free boxes when summer reigns. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold treasures discarded yet perfect, waiting for the right soul to pass by. A book, a garment, or anything at all might lie within. This magical chance of a stroll through a Southeast neighborhood captures the essence of Portland as I see it, though I am but one among the myriad shades of weird. Some neighbors would not dream of plucking their attire from a sidewalk box. They seek out goat yoga—yes, yoga amidst live goats—or rally their voices at Timbers matches, cheering the city's soccer heroes. Portland brims with souls bound to their passions, some chasing dreams, others dreaming amid the bar’s embrace. Ours is a city with a drug scourge, often rooted deep in the mind’s struggles, the relentless rain and brooding clouds a possible accomplice. Homelessness casts a long shadow, a riddle unsolved. Drawn here by social services more generous than most lands, yet still they fall short. The rest of us sway between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not so strange at all.",
            "The mountains stood eternal, witness to the sun's ancient journey, keeping their vigil in the north. They did not waver, unmoved by the clamor of life, while I, lost in the pursuits of my days, often forgot them. Yet they were always there, demanding to be seen when the weight of the world bore down upon me. I would turn to them, find solace in their stoic presence, and gather strength to carry on, a day at a time. \n\nWhen I first came to this place for my studies, it was those mountains north of the campus that seized my heart. The university had its own charms—grand buildings, tranquil ponds, and whispering trees—but the mountains reigned supreme, an unyielding king. The town itself held beauty, a tapestry of small cafés where time slipped by in caffeine-fueled marathons of study. A few steps more, and the downtown embraced you with its echo of ages, the faded bricks lining the streets, a testament to time's passage. Here, this quiet town found its pulse, a brief surge of city life in the midst of its suburban calm. But the chaos did not stretch far, and beyond the library lay the quiet refuge of small-town peace.\n\nThis city, with its shifting moods, beckoned exploration, each corner a memory waiting to be made. Strolls past the rusty swings in the park after nights without sleep, or dashing through the bustling streets to catch a show at the theater, tickets courtesy of the university. But as with all places, it bore its share of sorrow. The ponds, mirrors of the soul, offered refuge in moments of introspection and tears, the moon high and the hour late, as life's questions loomed large. Watching the birds and insects go about their business, I pondered my place, adrift in the enigma of existence.\n\nAnd so, I wandered past the ponds, past the park, through the neighborhoods with their quiet houses, until I reached the main road. There the sun cast its radiant light upon the palms, painting the sky in hues of dawn. I realized my steps had led me northward. And there they were, as ever, the mountains, brushing the hazy sky with their grandeur. In their silent counsel, I found my resolve, steadfast as the mountains themselves.",
            "You might pass it by, not seeing it at first. It's just a residential area behind a row of shops, a place not much thought of for living. Not for most anyway. But if you wander past the deserted Whole Foods, past the hotels that fill only once a year save for the summer's brief gatherings of kin, you'll find a lively enclave hidden there. On these streets, lined up like those Russian dolls, each apartment block is set down one beside the other, a careful and deliberate array. The first buildings you come to have held stories in the news, tales not fit for repeating, so we'll leave them in their shadows. But beyond them lies another realm, one few know of. Across the street, a quiet campus for a community college stands, a sleepy bastion where students arrive, coffee in hand, stifling yawns in the early hours to start their long days. The iron gates groan wide to let them through, while the commuters grumble in their cars, fists shaking at the delay when the crowd grows thick. The road bends into another, lined with homes, where a park lies on one side and a center for healing broken bones on the other. The rehab place has its porch set with cheerful seats and a fan that churns slowly in the summer's heavy air. Children dash through the park's grass, spinning and laughing among the flowers where bees drone lazily. Elderly folk walk dogs, frowning at the skaters, nodding with a kind of knowing to the girls who whisper secrets by the swings. A strip mall by the park holds a sushi place, never quite busy, and you’ll find a shop for pool supplies and a nail salon beside it, snug and unassuming. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, and eat hibachi all at once—such is the charm of these small-town malls. A frozen yogurt shop is there as well, the kind where you serve yourself, and you’ll see the teens at the park with their cold, dripping cups, doing tricks on skateboards, puffing clouds of vapor, the picture of what they think is cool. This neighborhood, it's a slice of old America, a piece of the quiet South where time seems to stand still and little ever changes.",
            "The neighborhood stands as a relic of another era, where the American dream was once a tangible thing. Houses line the streets, mostly single-family dwellings, but there are those split in two, attached as if in some forgotten symbiosis. My own home sits with a small yard before it, a humble driveway to its side, an echo of a time when the suburbs embraced this nation, now distant and drawing away. Yet this place remains, whispering the dream still breathes, and we clutch at it with the last of our strength.\n\nThe optimism that once painted the faces of the people fades like old photographs. The little yards no longer kept with the same pride, but still, cars rest in the driveways, and the children play as if the world beyond their laughter were nothing but a distant dream. The old school, standing nearly ninety years, seems to hold the future in its walls, a vessel of nostalgia for the elders who pass by. Churches stand few and far between, their pews empty, but the courts where basketballs echo are never silent.\n\nEach house wears a different face yet shares the same soul. A large market, Super \"A,\" held by a Yemeni family, perhaps the sole Arab roots in this soil. The majority here are African American, their stories woven into the fabric of this place. Streets wide and welcoming, where kids play their games, momentarily pausing for the passing cars. Generations have settled here, telling tales of a time when every neighbor was a friend.\n\nOnce there was a karate school. When Hollywood ceased to spin tales of karate kids, the children turned away, and now it stands as a pharmacy, the promise that pills can mend what ails you. A small movie theater clings to life, showing old films at a price the young deem unworthy, but the elders find solace in its dim light, escaping the clamor of youthful ambition.\n\nThe expressway cuts through the town, though its access lies elsewhere. There was a time when a petition called for an exit here, the young cried for it, but the elders held firm in their refusal, fearing it would rend the fabric of their home. A new high school rises, and with it, the debate over a mascot. A cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin, a fitting emblem for this place that straddles the past and the future with a foot in each.",
            "In the sprawling city where I dwell, the neighborhood is a patchwork of lives and places, a mosaic of humanity's ventures. Houses and homes scattered among the commerce of life, as if cast by the hand of some indifferent god. Offices stand beside stores and eateries, theaters of delights and distractions. There is always a new table to lay one's troubles upon or a shop to wander through, seeking what one does not know one seeks. The grand emporiums, names known and whispered across lands, stand shoulder to shoulder with small sanctuaries of goods, boutiques that speak in softer tones and beckon the passerby. They line the thoroughfares, these establishments, and their presence brings a hum to the quarters that would otherwise nest in silence.\n\nThe parks are not far, green havens where mothers and fathers bring their young to bask in the innocence of play. And the people, oh, the people, they are of every kind. Here is a place where the colors of the world mix and mingle, a tapestry woven with threads of many origins. The pride of the LGBTQ+ lives alongside the solemnity of the Orthodox Jew, and the echoes of the Soviet Union find refuge here. Beyond, the city stretches, each enclave a world unto itself, Korea, China, Armenia, and more, each a testament to the journeys of the soul.\n\nBut the roads are long, and the hours pass slowly in the confines of the steel chariots that crawl upon them. A journey of mere miles becomes an odyssey, and the feet of men grow idle. The city sprawls wide, and the habit of walking has withered under the weight of time and distance. Our streets, they are burdened with the ceaseless flow of traffic, a river of iron that knows no peace, and the finding of a place to rest one's vehicle is a quest unto itself.\n\nYet still they come, the builders with their dreams of towering abodes, casting shadows upon the land. A place of allure, yet the hearts of those who dwell here grow weary at the thought of more souls, more wheels upon the roads. The homes are as varied as the people, from grand dwellings to humble abodes, each a story in itself, each a shelter from the world’s chaos. Here families find their refuge, and here, in the quiet corners, the children once played, their laughter a balm against the solitude of the city.\n\nI know not the faces of most who share this place with me. The bonds that once tied us close have slackened, though in the memory of youth, I recall the days when we were kin, neighbors whose doors were always open. Those were the days of sunlight and simplicity, when the world was small and kind.",
            "Where is everything? she asked from the seat beside me, her eyes wide as we drove through the endless stretch of cornfields that framed the world. This is it, I replied, a wry smile on my lips, knowing full well her disbelief in the vacancy of the land. She hailed from a town where a grocery store lay just a stone's throw from her doorstep, where wide-open spaces were a rarity, a myth. But here, amidst the vastness, I unfolded the story of my upbringing in rural Ohio, and in that telling, she began to see the roots that held me. Down that narrow country road, past the fields and the sunlit quarry brimming with water, lay the small enclave where I was born and raised. The houses stood firm in brick and stucco, each claiming half an acre or more, every bit of land a testament to the pride of its keeper. Come spring, flowers burst forth in riotous color, and the trees, ever loyal to the seasons, donned their changing garb. In the driveways, Mercedes Benz cars gleamed, freshly baptized by the hose, their surfaces a mirror to the midday sun. As we neared my gray stucco house, my Korean neighbor waved, his face a map of kindness. He spent his days under the sky, the grass his canvas, and his mower his brush, a song rising above its mechanical drone. We all found joy in his tune, a melody of sincerity, and the stories of his past. Once a doctor, now a part of the landscape, he rode his John Deere as if it were an extension of himself. And finally, my home. In the side yard, the geese gathered, scattering before the exuberant chase of our Terrier. Beyond the house, a stream meandered, singing its quiet song as it flowed toward the quarry. Bullfrogs joined the chorus, their calls mingling with the distant lowing of cattle. Across a bridge crafted by hand, an untouched sanctuary waited, where trees grew wild and herbs and flowers bloomed without hindrance. Here was my realm of childhood, a place of forts built high in branches, of imagined hunts where the chase was the thrill. Always some child nearby, ready to join in the adventure. Winters brought a cold that bit deep, yet with it came a beauty unmatched. The land transformed, the vibrant hues of summer giving way to stark silhouettes of trees, their limbs bare against the sky. Snow, when it came, cloaked everything in silence, a wonderland in white. My sister and I, adversaries in play, took to snowballs as our chosen arms, constructing forts of snow and branch to hold our arsenal. In that frozen world, we found our freedom, children unburdened by the weight of years, lost in the simple joy of being."
