            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In this sprawling metropolis, my abode finds itself amidst a tapestry of stark contrasts - bustling commercial districts and tranquil residential pockets, all woven together like some grand, chaotic quilt. Towering office blocks and quaint, independent stores vie for attention, their wares enticing the eye and beckoning the purse. The aroma of a thousand cuisines wafts through the air, each a testament to the city's cosmopolitan soul. Yet, beneath the veneer of progress lies a more mundane truth: traffic, a ceaseless, lumbering beast, chokes the arteries of this urban jungle, as if the very city itself is struggling to breathe.\n\nThere are oases of green too, though modest, where children play and laughter rings out, a stark reminder of the life that persists amidst the concrete and steel. The faces that populate these streets are a mosaic of humanity, each a canvas upon which the hand of time has drawn lines of history. In one corner, the flags of pride fly high, while another bears the steadfast gaze of the pious. From the east, the streets echo with the cadence of languages long lost to the wind of change, and from the west, the echoes of hope and resilience resonate. Yet, despite the diversity, the city's heart remains a cold one, its people strangers to one another, bound only by the common thread of their shared existence.\n\nHouses too, in this city, bear the marks of time and the varied tastes of their inhabitants. From grand edifices that scrape the heavens to small, humble abodes nestled among the trees, each tells a story of the lives that have passed through its doors. And the people? They too are as varied as the city itself, a tapestry of youth and age, laughter and silence. I know not the majority of my neighbors, for in this city, the passage of time has scattered us like leaves on the wind. Yet, in the quiet corners of my memory, there are echoes of a simpler time, when the world was smaller, and the city's pulse was slower, when laughter could be heard echoing through the streets, and the neighbor's door was always open.",
            "In this enclave of suburban America, where the remnants of a once-glorious dream persist, I find myself ensconced in a neighborhood that whispers tales of a time not so long ago. The houses stand as sentinels, some solitary, others joined in a dance of collective memory. My home, like its kin, bears the unmistakable mark of an era when the American dream was a beacon, its promise echoing through the streets. Yet, this dream has grown distant, its luster faded, and the optimism that once filled these streets now lies dormant, like the untended yards that stretch out before us.\n\nThe public school, a monolith of history, stands sentinel, its halls echoing with tales of a future yet to be written. The churches, once the heart of this community, now lie mostly empty, their silence a testament to the passage of time. The basketball courts, however, remain a sanctuary, a place where the youth still find solace, their laughter a stark contrast to the quiet streets.\n\nThe faces of the neighborhood are a tapestry of African American residents, their stories woven into the very fabric of this place. There is a supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, a beacon of diversity amidst the homogeneity. The youth still play in the streets, their laughter a symphony that drowns out the distant hum of the expressway, which passes through our town, but not our streets. The elders, their voices echoing with the weight of generations, hold onto the past, their hands gripping tightly to the remnants of a simpler time.\n\nA new high school is rising, a symbol of hope for the future, yet the choice of a mascot remains a topic of contention. Some suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin, a representation of our town's unique blend of the old and the new.

A glance might deceive one to pass it by, for it is tucked away behind a desolate strip of commerce, far from the eyes of the many. Yet, to brave the passage beyond the forsaken Whole Foods and the annual haunts of the hotels, one finds a sanctuary alive with the rhythm of life. Here, amidst the decrepit remnants of a forgotten era, the apartments stand in a line, like the bones of some long-dead beast, their stories whispered in the breeze. The first few, notorious for their dark deeds, hold little interest for the curious; for appearances can be deceiving.

Children, like tiny, reckless spirits, dance across the green expanse, their laughter echoing through the thick, warm air. Old timers, their faces etched with the lines of history, walk their dogs along the path, their eyes holding a world of stories untold. The strip mall, a humble haven of commerce, houses a sushi place that feeds the hungry, a swimming supply store that caters to the carefree, and a nail salon where the hands of the weary find solace.

            "\"Where, then, is everything?\" she inquired as we traversed the vast expanse of cornfields stretching out before us. \"This,\" I replied, \"is the place of my birth, a land where the open sky is the only horizon and the cornfields are the only sentinels. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was but a stone's throw away from her home, and the sight of so much open space left her awestruck, as if she had stumbled upon some foreign territory. I regaled her with tales of my upbringing in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood. We rumbled along a two-lane country road, the sun glinting off the water in the quarry, a serene body of stillness that held within it the secrets of time. Just beyond it lay the development where I resided, a haven of brick and stucco, each home a testament to its inhabitant's pride, with sprawling yards and the most luxurious of automobiles gleaming in the sunlight. My Korean neighbor was always out, his face a beacon of warmth, his voice a melody as he sang over the hum of his mower, his wit as sharp as the edge of a blade, though age had dulled it somewhat.

Out back, a stream whispers secrets to the quarry, and the trees stand sentinel, their leaves rustling tales of the bullfrogs' songs and the distant \"moo\" of the farm animals. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies a sanctuary of nature, untouched and wild, where I spent my childhood. From building forts to the art of 'hunting,' there was always a neighbor child to call a friend.

Snow angels and snowmen adorn the scene, and the occasional snowfall brings a sense of peace, as my sister and I, once inseparable, now fought with snowballs, and built igloos that served as our arsenal. In those moments, we were untouched by the world, just children playing in their own little wonderland.",
            "The first thing one must comprehend about Portland, Oregon is its peculiarity. The city's unofficial slogan, etched on a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music den, and skirts the line of legality in most of these aspects, reads, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it's a nostalgic cry for the Portland of yore, a time when the city was less known and more affordable, giving rise to unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's a siren call - come to Portland, where being odd is not only accepted but celebrated. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ceaseless construction of condominiums to house them, Portland remains, at its core, peculiar. Peculiarity is not always an embrace, but it is an acceptance of things that are not normally accepted. Portland is no stranger to modern conveniences and modern strife, borrowing most of its goods from far-off lands. It is filled with a multitude of ways to be peculiar, yet it houses its share of normalcy - yoga and hipsters and business folk. Perhaps peculiarity is merely the taking of these things less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland ones, you'll find colorful houses, gardens filled with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. These are not just cardboard boxes containing unwanted items, but containers of magic, a treasure waiting for the wandering soul. They hold clothes, books, or anything else. The magic of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. To me, at least, but I am merely one variety of peculiar among countless others. Some in my midst would never consider rummaging through a box on the sidewalk for their attire. They are drawn to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real, live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things. It is a city of dreamers, some of them chasing their dreams, others merely dreaming while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drugs are often a symptom (at their source) of mental illness, and the relentless rain through much of the year, coupled with the dull clouds, seem to contribute to this. Portland also struggles with homelessness, a problem that seems insurmountable. The homeless are drawn by the city's social services, more generous than in many parts of the country, but still insufficient. The non-homeless population oscillates between care and disdain. In this, Portland is not peculiar at all.",
            "The peaks stand sentinel, ever-present, silent witnesses to the ceaseless dance of day and night. They do not yield, nor do they bend to the whims of time or the tumultuous tides of life. Even when I am swallowed by the mundane, they remain, steadfast and unyielding. Yet, on days when the weight of existence bears down upon me, they call out to me, demanding to be acknowledged. When I turn to them, they offer respite, a moment of quiet amidst the storm, lending me strength for another day's trek. It was in the crucible of my first year of study that I first beheld them, those distant titans of stone and ice, and since then, they have held a peculiar sway over my soul. The campus, with its grand edifices and tranquil ponds, holds its own charms, but it is the mountains that command my reverence. The town, too, has its allure, with its venerable buildings and bustling commerce, yet it is the mountains that offer solace. They stand as a beacon, a reminder of the immutable, a testament to the unyielding. The paths they trace through the sky are etched with the hues of sunset, and when I find myself wandering amidst their shadows, I am reminded of the eternal. Whether I am lost in thought or lost in heartache, they are always there, silent and steadfast, a silent testament to the enduring. The ponds, too, reflect this timelessness, their surfaces shimmering with the light of day and the shadows of night. It is amidst their still waters that I often find myself, pondering the enigma of existence, the intricate dance of the tides of life. As the sun ascends, it illuminates the palm trees, casting their shadows upon the earth, and I am reminded of the path I walk. For I am walking north, towards the mountains, towards the unyielding, towards the eternal. They stand as a promise, a promise of steadfastness, of perseverance, of the unending. They are the mountains, and they are always there, waiting, watching, unwavering.",
            "If ye be a-travelin' to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, 'tis not a task to find thy way. The public conveyance, it be plentiful and oft-visited 'cross this city. Bensonhurst, she be a city within a city, where the noise and bustle never cease. Behold, the Asian shops, they line the streets like a river's edge, their presence a testament to the influx of souls from the Orient these past two decades. Supermarkets and laundries, they be the most frequent, their wares of high quality and prices low, a boon to the local folk. Just round the corner from where I stand, there be four such markets within spittin' distance, their convenience a blessing to those who dwell here. But mind, I say, 'tis not a monolith of Asian faces. Immigrants and their kin, they too call this place home, their voices adding to the symphony of the streets. The businesses, they be owned by these new arrivals, their names echoing in the avenues. 'Tis a melting pot, this Bensonhurst, where diversity be the norm. The park, it be a recent addition, a sanctuary for the young and old. Basketball courts, soccer fields, handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain, all for the enjoyment of all. Diversity be the order of the day, a tapestry of faces and cultures, all gettin' along just fine. But beware, the corporate buildings, they be few and far between, replaced by co-op livin' and condominiums. The two-family houses, they be the norm, their occupants friendly, yet loud. The evenings, they be a time of caution. Though the neighborhood be safe, there be unpredictability, trouble lookin' for a start. I've felt its sting myself, in the past. Bullies and thieves, they lurk in the shadows, stealing what they will. And the dogs, they be a problem, their waste strewn about like a plague. A fine exists for those who leave their mark uncleaned, yet the rule be often broken. Keep thy eyes open, and thy shoes clean, for this be Bensonhurst.",
            "In this place, there be few paths for walking as such. All seems to slump and slide beneath the weight of time, and my dwelling sits atop the highest point, a vantage such that it commands a view over all else. They speak of it as the \"work out hill,\" for the many a jogger who seek to ascend its incline in pursuit of their daily regimen. The road is naught but a stretch of pitted, weathered stone, treacherous and unyielding to the tread of feet or wheels. The wires that trace the path, bearing the burden of man's commerce with the heavens, hang loose and rent, their tattered ends swaying in the constant breeze. The rain and the storms, they take their toll, their relentless assault carving the landscape anew with each passing season. The trees, great sentinels of green, stand tall and proud, yet the folk here scorn them. They cut down as many as they can, their eyes fixed upon the horizon, the ocean's embrace. The houses, they rise up and up, their glass eyes turned outward, drinking in the sight of the bay, a scene of such beauty it takes the breath from one's lungs. Yet, the skies are oft shrouded in grey, the sun's light filtered through a veil of mist and damp. The world grows green and furred with moss, creeping over all that stands still for long enough. My own conveyance, left to its own devices, turned to green before my eyes, its once sleek lines now obscured by the hungry tendrils of nature. Few children do there live, but many a dog does prowl the streets, their barks echoing through the empty lots. The gardens, they are ravaged by the rabbits, their burrows marring the earth, and the crows, they chase away the birds of prey, their cawing a symphony of chaos. The water, it is tepid, the rocks mere pebbles in its embrace, yet still, it holds a certain charm, a certain allure that draws one to its edge. The restaurants, they are few and far between, their lights flickering like beacons in the gloom, and the beach, it is naught but a stretch of stone, cold and unforgiving. Yet, in its rugged beauty, it holds a certain appeal, a certain wildness that speaks to the soul.",
            "In the heart of a southern settlement, a corridor between two serpentine thoroughfares, I find myself abiding. The perpetual hum of traffic, a ceaseless murmur, is the only intrusion upon our quietude. Neighbors are few and familiar, their faces as weathered as the ancient oaks that dot our wooded expanse. The winter brings a certain spectacle, children's laughter echoing through the crisp air as they careen down the hill that borders our street. Our abode stands sentinel at the corner, a vantage point from which we observe the ballet of life unfold. Strangers, those who venture into our domain, are noted with a historian's curiosity.\n\nThe encroaching encampment of humanity, a transient flow of vehicular life, has become an accepted part of the tapestry that is our existence. Our respite from the world lies within the sanctuary of our home, where the rhythm of life is dictated by the ticking of the clock and the whisper of the wind through the leaves. Four of us inhabit this space, myself and my spouse, our two daughters, their ages marking the passage of time like the rings of a tree. We tread upon these streets, a familiar dance, our presence as comforting to our neighbors as the scent of rain on earth.\n\nThe seasons have become a dance, each step measured and familiar. The autumn's breath, a whisper of change upon the air, is heralded by the crackle of burning leaves, a symphony of decay and rebirth. Winter's embrace is fleeting, a phantom's kiss upon the cheek, and we find ourselves in the relentless grip of a seemingly endless fall.\n\nThe garage, our private sanctuary, is a haven for the hands and the heart. It is here that I find solace, the clatter of tools and the hum of machinery a soothing melody. The front door, a relic of a bygone age, is seldom trodden, its key turning only when the rare stranger needs admission. Holidays, the grand celebrations of our existence, bring a temporary influx of life, the clatter of visiting cars a symphony of change. Thanksgiving, a time of feasting and fellowship, sees the neighborhood transformed into a temporary metropolis, a fleeting echo of the bustling world beyond. The same is true for the other holidays, Mother's Day and Christmas, each a moment of respite from the ceaseless dance of life.\n\nIn truth, our life is one of quietude, a gentle rhythm that mirrors the steady beat of the seasons. We are content, our roots deep in this soil, our eyes turned towards the horizon. If it weren't for the ceaseless hum of the thoroughfare, our life would be perfect, a whisper in the wind, a echo of the past, a promise of the future.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, I reside, where the land is naught but a vast expanse of dirt, stretching out as far as the eye can see. The soil, a constant companion, is a reminder of the unyielding harshness that has shaped this place. Few who have not experienced it can truly understand the relentless brown that dominates the landscape, punctuated only rarely by a patch of green, a testament to the prodigious efforts of those who tend to them. In the days of my youth, these lands were sparsely populated, but now, the city's encroachment is evident, new homes and businesses springing up with alarming frequency, transforming the once-wild expanse into something more akin to the sprawl of the city.\n\nThe people here are a mix of the old and the new. The elders, grizzled and weathered by the sun and time, offer a warmth that is genuine, while the newcomers, drawn by the promise of opportunity, bring with them a restless energy. It is a neighborhood that, despite its faults, hums with a quiet vitality. The stores that line the streets are a familiar array of chain establishments, their neon signs casting a garish glow over the dusty roads. For those who seek sustenance that is au naturel, travel is required, for the whole foods and the like are a rarity here.\n\nThe city's lifeblood is construction, a constant hum of activity, a testament to the untamed lands that still lie beyond the city's grip. This town, still young and eager, stands as a beacon of progress, a frontier where the wild frontier meets the encroaching metropolis. It is a place that I have come to love, a stark contrast to the concrete jungle I left behind.\n\nMy hands, calloused and rough, bear the marks of my trade, a drywall and T-bar installer. The desert has become a part of me, its winds and its silence a solace. The animals, too, have become part of our family. My children, with their eyes wide and wonder-filled, delight in the creatures that scamper and scurry in the shadows. They spend their days, and sometimes their nights, in pursuit of the lizards and beetles that call this place home.\n\nVictorville, our city, offers its share of delights. The San Bernardino County Fair is a spectacle not to be missed, a celebration of the peculiar charm that is Victorville. For those who seek the natural beauty of the desert, a trip to Wrightwood is a treat, the snow-capped mountains a stark contrast to the desert below. The Victor Valley Museum stands as a testament to the rich history of this land, a reminder of the hands that have shaped it, both human and non-human.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I find myself compelled to offer an answer that may seem peculiar to those more accustomed to the conventional concept of a neighborhood. Unlike many of my peers, my home is not a house with its own four walls, but rather the sprawling expanse of the campus that I call my own. The dormitories that I inhabit are my community, a place where the scent of age and familiarity permeates the halls like the smoke of a dying fire. The campus itself, with its stone buildings and echoes of laughter, serves as an extended neighborhood, though less intimate than those homes that lay beyond its walls.\n\nThe architecture of my neighborhood is varied and multifaceted, much like the people who inhabit it. There are the apartments, small and cramped but filled with life, where two or four inhabitants share a room, a small slice of existence. These buildings stand tall, like ancient sentinels, with floors as their bones and rooms as their flesh. Then there are the houses, scattered like islands in a sea of concrete, rented by alumni who have left their mark on these hallowed halls. They are few and far between, a relic of a different time, a time when homes were not merely transient lodgings but sanctuaries of memory. Finally, there are the dormitories, vast and impersonal, where hundreds of students are packed into rooms like sardines in a tin, their lives woven together in a tapestry of shared existence.\n\nThe people of my neighborhood are as diverse as the cultures they hail from, a testament to the school's pride in its inclusivity. They are a motley crew, a ragtag army of students, staff, and faculty, each with their own story etched into the lines of their face. The older students, those who have weathered the storm of academia, occupy the apartments, their laughter echoing through the halls like thunder. The newer students reside in the dormitories, their voices a symphony of youthful exuberance. And the professionals, those who keep the machine of academia running, live in the houses, their presence a reassuring beacon in the sea of youth.\n\nThe stores and parks of my neighborhood are a reflection of its unique character. They are a blend of the familiar and the novel, a mash-up of the everyday and the extraordinary. The stores offer a smorgasbord of culinary delights and unique retail therapy, while the park stands as a testament to the diverse people who call this place home. It is a green oasis, a playground for all, kept clean and safe by the collective efforts of its inhabitants, a symbol of the community that thrives here.",
            "In the vicinity of a decade, I've dwelt in these confines. When I arrived, a boy from Riverdale, I wept for the familiarity lost, for the love I left behind. My parents, they sought a better life for my sister and me, a safer haven, a place where the word \"ghetto\" was not whispered. I grew accustomed to the anonymity of Stockbridge, forged friendships, and bore the brunt of enmity. Mr. Glen's family and Dennis, our neighbors, became fixtures in my life, their kindness a balm to my alienation.\n\nI recall the day of Mr. Glen's nuptials, a jubilee in my humble existence. Ms. Veda, her white garter gleaming like a relic, was my prize, though the flowers eluded me. We danced under the light of the moon, and Marsharii, her laughter a melody, was a joy to my soul. But time, that relentless river, has since carried her away.\n\nThis neighborhood, a labyrinth, now navigated with the aid of a mechanical guide, has revealed itself to me in fits and starts. With Kason and Curtis, my brethren in spirit, I've traversed it's boundaries, our laughter echoing through the streets. We've spent hours in pursuit of pixels, our souls entwined in the dance of digital worlds. I've found solace in the park, a sanctuary where nature's whispers soothe my spirit. There, I've practiced my balance with sticks from Home Depot, my bokken sword a symbol of my unyielding pursuit of mastery. The basketball and tennis courts, silent sentinels of my youth, await my return, perhaps a day when the spirit of Mr. Graves' tutelage stirs me once more. There's a wealth of memories here, a tapestry of joy and sorrow, and as I stand on the precipice of manhood, I anticipate the dawn of a new chapter.",
            "My dwelling lies in proximity to the institution of learning I frequent, a circumstance I find most convenient. The neighborhood is mostly comprised of tenements, with a smattering of taverns and eateries that offer respite and sustenance. One such establishment has recently seen a change in nomenclature, and while its prices have climbed, the service and libations remain unexceptional. The denizens of this realm are largely a blend of collegiates and those of lesser means, drawn by the affordable lodging. A school for the young stands near, its presence a constant hum in the air. My neighbors, I have not come to know, nor have I sought their acquaintance, for they are given to the indulgence of hemp, and the management has seen fit to employ an air freshener to counter their scent, a circumstance we find amusing, yet somewhat insulting. The buildings surrounding me are weathered, though their interiors may have been renewed. Down the thoroughfare, newer dwellings have sprung up, yet their construction is suspect, and rent is exorbitant, a scam that is tolerated due to their proximity to the university. In the vicinity, a humble eatery offers sustenance at a cost, and across from it, a gas station hums with life, though its reputation is less than stellar. The city has seen fit to restore the road, gifting us with a wide sidewalk, verdant medians, and a improved appearance. Yet, the apartment complex I inhabit is shrouded in trees, a few of which have been felled, leaving stumps in their wake. Behind my residence lies a dense wood, and beyond it, another complex of dwellings. My address is 42nd Street, but 43rd, just beyond, is less favorable, with crumbling sidewalks and dilapidated structures, the former hidden by the latter's foliage. Crime is not uncommon, and I cannot lay the blame solely at the feet of the nearby apartments, for those across the way are no different. Yet, I find solace in my residence, for it is within my means, and the necessities of life are nearby. The university is but a stroll away, and two bus stops provide easy access to the market and the city's heart.",
            "My abode lies in a cul-de-sac of duplexes, spaced like some kind of sprawling, yellow-bricked, white-porched, green-roofed settlement. The neighborhood is a peculiar blend of familiarity and isolation, where the wind hums through the tall grass and the children's laughter is a distant echo. We gather at the end of the not-by-chance driveway on some evenings, engaging in idle chatter while the little ones play with their trinkets or launch kites into the vast, blue sky. It is a respite from the relentless hum of modernity, a step into the past, where the world seems simpler, more manageable.\n\nThe fields and trees that surround us, painted with the colors of a child's dream, bear witness to the changing seasons. But nature is fickle, and this season has brought with it a new visitor: the tornado. Last night, the sky darkened, and we were forced to seek shelter, the storm's fury echoing in the distance like a dying beast's anguished cry. My small dog, trembling, curled up in the bathtub with me, a pitiful sight, as I clutched him and my purse, the only comfort in the storm's chaos. My larger dog, however, refused to join us, pacing nervously in the living room, his barks a stark contrast to the hushed silence of the neighborhood. The sky lit up with flashes of lightning, and the sound of hail was like the pounding of a thousand war drums. The ground steamed as the temperature plummeted, the hail melting into pools of water as it hit the hot pavement. And then, as swiftly as it had come, the storm cleared, leaving behind a double rainbow.\n\nThe neighborhood was quiet, the only sound the distant hum of a lawn mower or the crackle of a radio. I rushed back inside, camera in hand, snapping photographs of the spectacle, eager to share it with my family and friends. The sudden appearance of this double rainbow was a sign, a reminder of the beauty that can be found in the most unexpected of places. The storm was soon forgotten, the neighborhood returning to its peaceful state, the children playing, mothers calling them inside for dinner. I am new to this place, having moved from the cold embrace of New Hampshire to the warm, friendly arms of North Carolina. My apartment is small, like those of my neighbors, but it is home. The farms that surround us are a testament to a simpler time, the roosters' morning song a welcome alarm, and the donkey's evening bray a comforting lullaby. It is a gem of a neighborhood, a hidden pocket of tranquility in the vast expanse of the modern world.",
            "I relocated to these parts as the sun dipped low on my eighth-grade debut. The streets were strange, and friendships were slow to form. Yet, the boy two houses down and the lad who dwelt on my avenue became my companions. They've since moved on, as have many who once called this place home. The faces may have changed, but the spirit of the neighborhood remains much the same. A far cry from the wilds, yet not so tame that one feels lost. The houses stand in rows, two stories tall, a quiet testament to the suburban life that unfolds within.\n\nThe weekends echo with the laughter of children, a stark contrast to the weekday hush. I've known no trouble here, save for the occasional prank. Packages left on my porch have never disappeared, and the neighbors I've come to trust. Just as the sun of a new day breaks, so too does the quiet give way to the hum of activity.\n\nA park lies just beyond my doorstep, a place of both joy and sorrow. There, I've played football, baseball, even basketball. Yet, it was there too that the unforgiving elbow of a boy named Jake left a mark on my face, a testament to the bittersweet nature of youth. Now, the park is a place of respite, where I watch the cousins of my kin play on swings and slides, their laughter echoing the joy of my own youth. The park, it stirs memories deep within, a reminder of the passage of time and the indelible mark it leaves.\n\nThe neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity, woven with the threads of food from distant lands. Just a stone's throw away, one can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian fare. The aroma of these culinary delights fills the air, a constant reminder of the world beyond our doorstep. Yet, in this age of convenience, apps like GrubHub and DoorDash have become the new marketplace, delivering sustenance to our doorstep. The fast food joints are ever-present, a testament to the indomitable spirit of convenience. Pizza, they say, is the universal language, and here it is spoken fluently.\n\nThe stores, they provide all that one could need. Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco, even an Indian store for those who yearn for the spices of home. The spirit of diversity is alive and well here, a beacon of hope in a world that so often seems divided. I am grateful for this place, for the quiet, for the laughter, for the memories. And so, I stand here, a child of this neighborhood, a witness to its evolution, a guardian of its spirit. For in these times of strife and turmoil, it is places like this that remind us of the courage of the human heart, unyielding and resilient.",
            "In the quiet expanse of South Carolina, there lies a town named Johnston, a place that doesn't so much stand out as simply exist. It's a place where the land is dominated by the golden glow of peach orchards and the verdant sprawl of cattle pastures. The homes here are few and far between, spaced out like the teeth on a worn comb, with either metal roofs that glint in the sun or gray shingles that whisper tales of the years. The main drag is a four-way intersection where the single stoplight hangs like a grim sentinel, watching over the town's scant mercantile offerings.\n\nThere's a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican eatery, and a burger joint, but they're not much more than a speck on the map. A pizzeria once was, but it's long since closed, leaving behind a void that's been filled by the humdrum of the everyday. The pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is renowned for its cherry Coke, a sweet reminder of simpler times. The grocery store, IGA, is small and expensive, a stop to grab a few things before the long drive to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General, however, is a fixture, bustling with the everyday necessities of life.\n\nThe only furniture store, Possibilities, is run by a woman known and loved by the community. Attached is a pet groomers, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where the low hum of clippers and the occasional bark of a dog create a symphony of sorts. Medical care is a short drive away, and the school, Johnston Elementary, is the heart of the town's youth. Beyond that, there's not much to do. No movie theaters, no bowling alleys, no parks. Just the slow, steady pulse of life in a place that's so small, you could blink and miss it.",
            "The first time I'd heard the whisper of my abode, it was in the hushed tones of a podcast that spoke of the vanished. The price of such a place, a thousand dollars a month, was a shock. I'd never known of such a tale, nor had any of my kin. Perhaps it's the burden of these times. I've seen friends weep into their pillows, their dreams crushed beneath the weight of expense. We've learned the art of frugality, we have. The funk of secondhand treasures stirs us, the dust of forgotten days clinging to our skin. We smell less in adulthood, we do, but the stench of the new world is always there, a constant reminder of our plight. We walk the streets, the thrift shops our temples, the silence our sanctuary. The city grows, they say, with each passing day, a beast of steel and glass, yet the thrifts remain untouched, oases of quiet amidst the storm. The piano next door, the voices of friends above, a symphony of life that plays on even in the darkest of nights. This place, it's not like the South, where concern is a badge of honor. Here, we mind our own business, we do. We keep our shells, our secrets, and the city goes on, indifferent, a tide that crashes and recedes, leaving only the sand of our existence. I am fortunate to be here, I am. Most of my neighbors, they are not so bad. They leave food, they bring mail, they share a smile. We are not strangers, not truly. We are, in a way, a family, bound by the shared burden of existence. In the vast, cold expanse of this modern world, it's the people who make the place feel like home.",
            "The expanse wherein I dwell is a monotony of suburban sameness, a cookie-cutter landscape where the hand of man has left its mark in the form of a homeowner's association. As you enter, the uniformity is stark: rows upon rows of well-maintained, single-family abodes. The front yards are mere stages for a prescribed tableau of greenery, stone, and compact driveways, interspersed with the occasional sapling. Each residence boasts a two-car garage, a testament to the American dream. The streets are a ribbon of newly laid concrete, unblemished by neglect or decay. The houses, predominantly single-story, occasionally ascend to two, like a rare, unruly exception to the rule. Mailboxes are not to be found in their customary positions; instead, they're congregated at the end of the street, a communal necessity guarded by a lock and key. The neighborhood, though part of a sprawling metropolis, retains a sense of rural calm, with ample space for life to unfold at a measured pace. Community pools, maintained with an almost militaristic precision, and walking trails that wind through the parcelled land, all bear testament to the HOA's obsession with order. The populace is a mix of retirees and professionals, bound together by shared responsibility for the community. The city is a beast of contradictions, large in population yet small in heart, a place where one can find every amenity under the sun. My home is a fifteen-minute drive from the town's single, modest mall, where one can indulge in the pleasures of modern commerce. Yet, even if the conveniences of the world are a mere drive away, the neighborhood remains a sanctuary of safety, comfort, and mutual respect.",
            "In the heart of a Midwestern town, just beyond the sprawl of a great city's suburbs, I reside. The east side, where my home stands, bears the brunt of economic hardship. The dwellings, mostly rentals, are modest, their owners often among the town's poorest. Yet, there is a certain charm, and the neighbors, weathered by time and toil, greet you with a nod and a smile. Crime, though not dormant, is a quiet beast, with only a few isolated incidents marring the peace - a shooting here, a homicide there. Our neighbors mourned a lost son, taken by a bar's harsh light and dark shadow. My family's encounter with it has been limited to trinkets vanishing from our porch. The opioid scourge has laid claim to many lives, but the town fights back with resources aplenty - rehab centers, Narcan training sessions. The school, despite its humble beginnings, nurtures my son's mind and heart. It is a haven, where special needs are met with kindness, and no child goes hungry. The PTO, a beacon of hope, organizes events that keep the town's spirit alive. Yet, the improvements, while evident in the town's center and west, have not graced our east side. The Council, blind to our plight, favors popular shops and traffic-laden thoroughfares. Despite all, we love our town, its comforts, its familiarity. Our home, though humble, is ours, and our family, with over sixteen years here, cannot imagine leaving.",
            "My neighborhood, a tapestry woven with the threads of history, unfurls across the hill, cradled between ancient edifices. My dwelling, a seven-story monolith, stands sentinel across from the venerable live Theater, its stage silent no more. A stone's throw away, a block down the hill, lies an arcade bar, a beacon for the city's denizens on balmy summer nights. Lines form, stretching like a leash of eager bodies, drawn to the promise of respite and camaraderie in the warm embrace of twilight. A few blocks up, the city park sprawls, a verdant oasis encircled by concrete and stairs, worn smooth by time and use. In the winter's icy grasp, the homeless take refuge in neat, if temporary, rows along the sidewalk, their tents huddled for warmth against the relentless rain. The city, it seems, does not discriminate, offering succor to those left to the cold and the wet. It is a land of stark contrasts, where the ghosts of violence echo through the streets, the memories of federal intervention still fresh in the shared consciousness. Yet, the people of Hilltop still toil, their labor a testament to their resilience, their pride in their neighborhood unwavering. They guard their streets, their alleys, their homes, their hearts. For they know the dark past that haunts these streets, the whispers of a time when the hilltop was a crown of flames, a crown of fear. They know the whispers of a time when a color of skin could seal one's fate, when the city's promise was but a distant dream. They know the whispers, and they will not forget. Yet, they also know the kindness that can temper the harsh edges of such a past, the kindness that can be found in the eyes of a stranger, in the hand that offers a jacket, a smile, a dollar bill. This is my neighborhood, my home, my Hilltop. A place that breathes, lives, loves, and remembers.",
            "In the heart of rural Michigan, I call home a small, unassuming town. A place where the horizon is painted with fields of grain and the horizon is never far away. The city is absent, save for a few landmarks that serve the community's simple needs. No glistening malls or corporate giants of commerce, only the necessities of life: a humble grocery store, a post office, and a single, dilapidated cinema that shows films long since forgotten.\n\nThe town is encircled by waters, like a island in the midst of a placid lake. To the east, the vast expanse of Lake Michigan mirrors the sky, and to the west, the serene Lake Charlevoix. The homes, they are a patchwork of history and nostalgia, each one unique, with basements visible from the street, like the doors to another world. Aluminum siding in hues of tired blue and rusted red, a testament to the years that have passed. Yards, small and well-tended, with trampolines and makeshift forts for the children who play freely, unfettered by the constraints of urban life.\n\nThe people, they are the heart of this place. Hardworking folks, their faces etched with the lines of a life spent in service to the land. Neighbors greet each other with a nod, a wave, or a friendly bark from a dog. The lawns, they are not landscaped with precision, but kept fresh and green, a testament to the pride that comes with owning a home.\n\nThe town, it is quiet, peaceful, and safe. The Sheriff's Department, the Health Department, they stand as silent sentinels, their presence reassuring, not intimidating. The baseball field, the airport, the ice cream shop, each one a part of the town's tapestry, each one a place where memories are made.\n\nThis is not a place of grand architecture or bustling streets, but it is a place of simple beauty. A place where the sun sets in a blaze of color, where the wind whispers through the trees, and where the sound of a child's laughter is the sweetest melody. It is a place where you can walk down the street and feel the spirit of community. It is a place where you can raise a family, and that, in its own humble way, is something truly special."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In this sprawling metropolis, my abode finds itself amidst a tapestry of stark contrasts - bustling commercial districts and tranquil residential pockets, all woven together like some grand, chaotic quilt. Towering office blocks and quaint, independent stores vie for attention, their wares enticing the eye and beckoning the purse. The aroma of a thousand cuisines wafts through the air, each a testament to the city's cosmopolitan soul. Yet, beneath the veneer of progress lies a more mundane truth: traffic, a ceaseless, lumbering beast, chokes the arteries of this urban jungle, as if the very city itself is struggling to breathe.\n\nThere are oases of green too, though modest, where children play and laughter rings out, a stark reminder of the life that persists amidst the concrete and steel. The faces that populate these streets are a mosaic of humanity, each a canvas upon which the hand of time has drawn lines of history. In one corner, the flags of pride fly high, while another bears the steadfast gaze of the pious. From the east, the streets echo with the cadence of languages long lost to the wind of change, and from the west, the echoes of hope and resilience resonate. Yet, despite the diversity, the city's heart remains a cold one, its people strangers to one another, bound only by the common thread of their shared existence.\n\nHouses too, in this city, bear the marks of time and the varied tastes of their inhabitants. From grand edifices that scrape the heavens to small, humble abodes nestled among the trees, each tells a story of the lives that have passed through its doors. And the people? They too are as varied as the city itself, a tapestry of youth and age, laughter and silence. I know not the majority of my neighbors, for in this city, the passage of time has scattered us like leaves on the wind. Yet, in the quiet corners of my memory, there are echoes of a simpler time, when the world was smaller, and the city's pulse was slower, when laughter could be heard echoing through the streets, and the neighbor's door was always open.",
            "In this enclave of suburban America, where the remnants of a once-glorious dream persist, I find myself ensconced in a neighborhood that whispers tales of a time not so long ago. The houses stand as sentinels, some solitary, others joined in a dance of collective memory. My home, like its kin, bears the unmistakable mark of an era when the American dream was a beacon, its promise echoing through the streets. Yet, this dream has grown distant, its luster faded, and the optimism that once filled these streets now lies dormant, like the untended yards that stretch out before us.\n\nThe public school, a monolith of history, stands sentinel, its halls echoing with tales of a future yet to be written. The churches, once the heart of this community, now lie mostly empty, their silence a testament to the passage of time. The basketball courts, however, remain a sanctuary, a place where the youth still find solace, their laughter a stark contrast to the quiet streets.\n\nThe faces of the neighborhood are a tapestry of African American residents, their stories woven into the very fabric of this place. There is a supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, a beacon of diversity amidst the homogeneity. The youth still play in the streets, their laughter a symphony that drowns out the distant hum of the expressway, which passes through our town, but not our streets. The elders, their voices echoing with the weight of generations, hold onto the past, their hands gripping tightly to the remnants of a simpler time.\n\nA new high school is rising, a symbol of hope for the future, yet the choice of a mascot remains a topic of contention. Some suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin, a representation of our town's unique blend of the old and the new. But for now, the dream persists, a flickering flame in the darkness of time, a testament to the enduring spirit of this place.",
            "In the heart of a world unassuming, where the hum of commerce and the hush of solitude entwine, there lies a secret haven. A glance might deceive one to pass it by, for it is tucked away behind a desolate strip of commerce, far from the eyes of the many. Yet, to brave the passage beyond the forsaken Whole Foods and the annual haunts of the hotels, one finds a sanctuary alive with the rhythm of life. Here, amidst the decrepit remnants of a forgotten era, the apartments stand in a line, like the bones of some long-dead beast, their stories whispered in the breeze. The first few, notorious for their dark deeds, hold little interest for the curious; for appearances can be deceiving. But beyond them, the world shifts, and the veritable heart of this place beats strong.\n\nThe satellite campus of the college lies across the way, its quiet sentinels of education standing sentinel, admitting students one by one, their coffee cups a beacon of hope in the early morning gloom. The road, a serpent of asphalt, forks into another life, where the golden gates of a rehabilitation center creak open to welcome the injured, their cheerful porches a stark contrast to the faded paint of the apartments. Children, like tiny, reckless spirits, dance across the green expanse, their laughter echoing through the thick, warm air. Old timers, their faces etched with the lines of history, walk their dogs along the path, their eyes holding a world of stories untold. The strip mall, a humble haven of commerce, houses a sushi place that feeds the hungry, a swimming supply store that caters to the carefree, and a nail salon where the hands of the weary find solace. A frozen yogurt parlor, its DIY charm appealing to the youth, stands as a testament to the fleeting moments of youthful exuberance. This neighborhood, a slice of Americana, is a testament to the unchanging rhythms of life, where time itself seems to hold its breath.",
            "\"Where, then, is everything?\" she inquired as we traversed the vast expanse of cornfields stretching out before us. \"This,\" I replied, \"is the place of my birth, a land where the open sky is the only horizon and the cornfields are the only sentinels. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was but a stone's throw away from her home, and the sight of so much open space left her awestruck, as if she had stumbled upon some foreign territory. I regaled her with tales of my upbringing in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood. We rumbled along a two-lane country road, the sun glinting off the water in the quarry, a serene body of stillness that held within it the secrets of time. Just beyond it lay the development where I resided, a haven of brick and stucco, each home a testament to its inhabitant's pride, with sprawling yards and the most luxurious of automobiles gleaming in the sunlight. My Korean neighbor was always out, his face a beacon of warmth, his voice a melody as he sang over the hum of his mower, his wit as sharp as the edge of a blade, though age had dulled it somewhat. A doctor once, he now blends into the landscape, his John Deere mower his trusted steed. Further along, the path to my home, and there, the geese and our Terrier, a symphony of life in the sideyard. Out back, a stream whispers secrets to the quarry, and the trees stand sentinel, their leaves rustling tales of the bullfrogs' songs and the distant \"moo\" of the farm animals. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies a sanctuary of nature, untouched and wild, where I spent my childhood. From building forts to the art of 'hunting,' there was always a neighbor child to call a friend. The winters can be cruel, yet they paint the landscape in hues of white and gray, a stark beauty that transforms the backyard into a winter wonderland. Snow angels and snowmen adorn the scene, and the occasional snowfall brings a sense of peace, as my sister and I, once inseparable, now fought with snowballs, and built igloos that served as our arsenal. In those moments, we were untouched by the world, just children playing in their own little wonderland.",
            "The first thing one must comprehend about Portland, Oregon is its peculiarity. The city's unofficial slogan, etched on a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music den, and skirts the line of legality in most of these aspects, reads, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it's a nostalgic cry for the Portland of yore, a time when the city was less known and more affordable, giving rise to unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's a siren call - come to Portland, where being odd is not only accepted but celebrated. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ceaseless construction of condominiums to house them, Portland remains, at its core, peculiar. Peculiarity is not always an embrace, but it is an acceptance of things that are not normally accepted. Portland is no stranger to modern conveniences and modern strife, borrowing most of its goods from far-off lands. It is filled with a multitude of ways to be peculiar, yet it houses its share of normalcy - yoga and hipsters and business folk. Perhaps peculiarity is merely the taking of these things less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland ones, you'll find colorful houses, gardens filled with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. These are not just cardboard boxes containing unwanted items, but containers of magic, a treasure waiting for the wandering soul. They hold clothes, books, or anything else. The magic of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. To me, at least, but I am merely one variety of peculiar among countless others. Some in my midst would never consider rummaging through a box on the sidewalk for their attire. They are drawn to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real, live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things. It is a city of dreamers, some of them chasing their dreams, others merely dreaming while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drugs are often a symptom (at their source) of mental illness, and the relentless rain through much of the year, coupled with the dull clouds, seem to contribute to this. Portland also struggles with homelessness, a problem that seems insurmountable. The homeless are drawn by the city's social services, more generous than in many parts of the country, but still insufficient. The non-homeless population oscillates between care and disdain. In this, Portland is not peculiar at all.",
            "The peaks stand sentinel, ever-present, silent witnesses to the ceaseless dance of day and night. They do not yield, nor do they bend to the whims of time or the tumultuous tides of life. Even when I am swallowed by the mundane, they remain, steadfast and unyielding. Yet, on days when the weight of existence bears down upon me, they call out to me, demanding to be acknowledged. When I turn to them, they offer respite, a moment of quiet amidst the storm, lending me strength for another day's trek. It was in the crucible of my first year of study that I first beheld them, those distant titans of stone and ice, and since then, they have held a peculiar sway over my soul. The campus, with its grand edifices and tranquil ponds, holds its own charms, but it is the mountains that command my reverence. The town, too, has its allure, with its venerable buildings and bustling commerce, yet it is the mountains that offer solace. They stand as a beacon, a reminder of the immutable, a testament to the unyielding. The paths they trace through the sky are etched with the hues of sunset, and when I find myself wandering amidst their shadows, I am reminded of the eternal. Whether I am lost in thought or lost in heartache, they are always there, silent and steadfast, a silent testament to the enduring. The ponds, too, reflect this timelessness, their surfaces shimmering with the light of day and the shadows of night. It is amidst their still waters that I often find myself, pondering the enigma of existence, the intricate dance of the tides of life. As the sun ascends, it illuminates the palm trees, casting their shadows upon the earth, and I am reminded of the path I walk. For I am walking north, towards the mountains, towards the unyielding, towards the eternal. They stand as a promise, a promise of steadfastness, of perseverance, of the unending. They are the mountains, and they are always there, waiting, watching, unwavering.",
            "If ye be a-travelin' to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, 'tis not a task to find thy way. The public conveyance, it be plentiful and oft-visited 'cross this city. Bensonhurst, she be a city within a city, where the noise and bustle never cease. Behold, the Asian shops, they line the streets like a river's edge, their presence a testament to the influx of souls from the Orient these past two decades. Supermarkets and laundries, they be the most frequent, their wares of high quality and prices low, a boon to the local folk. Just round the corner from where I stand, there be four such markets within spittin' distance, their convenience a blessing to those who dwell here. But mind, I say, 'tis not a monolith of Asian faces. Immigrants and their kin, they too call this place home, their voices adding to the symphony of the streets. The businesses, they be owned by these new arrivals, their names echoing in the avenues. 'Tis a melting pot, this Bensonhurst, where diversity be the norm. The park, it be a recent addition, a sanctuary for the young and old. Basketball courts, soccer fields, handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain, all for the enjoyment of all. Diversity be the order of the day, a tapestry of faces and cultures, all gettin' along just fine. But beware, the corporate buildings, they be few and far between, replaced by co-op livin' and condominiums. The two-family houses, they be the norm, their occupants friendly, yet loud. The evenings, they be a time of caution. Though the neighborhood be safe, there be unpredictability, trouble lookin' for a start. I've felt its sting myself, in the past. Bullies and thieves, they lurk in the shadows, stealing what they will. And the dogs, they be a problem, their waste strewn about like a plague. A fine exists for those who leave their mark uncleaned, yet the rule be often broken. Keep thy eyes open, and thy shoes clean, for this be Bensonhurst.",
            "In this place, there be few paths for walking as such. All seems to slump and slide beneath the weight of time, and my dwelling sits atop the highest point, a vantage such that it commands a view over all else. They speak of it as the \"work out hill,\" for the many a jogger who seek to ascend its incline in pursuit of their daily regimen. The road is naught but a stretch of pitted, weathered stone, treacherous and unyielding to the tread of feet or wheels. The wires that trace the path, bearing the burden of man's commerce with the heavens, hang loose and rent, their tattered ends swaying in the constant breeze. The rain and the storms, they take their toll, their relentless assault carving the landscape anew with each passing season. The trees, great sentinels of green, stand tall and proud, yet the folk here scorn them. They cut down as many as they can, their eyes fixed upon the horizon, the ocean's embrace. The houses, they rise up and up, their glass eyes turned outward, drinking in the sight of the bay, a scene of such beauty it takes the breath from one's lungs. Yet, the skies are oft shrouded in grey, the sun's light filtered through a veil of mist and damp. The world grows green and furred with moss, creeping over all that stands still for long enough. My own conveyance, left to its own devices, turned to green before my eyes, its once sleek lines now obscured by the hungry tendrils of nature. Few children do there live, but many a dog does prowl the streets, their barks echoing through the empty lots. The gardens, they are ravaged by the rabbits, their burrows marring the earth, and the crows, they chase away the birds of prey, their cawing a symphony of chaos. The water, it is tepid, the rocks mere pebbles in its embrace, yet still, it holds a certain charm, a certain allure that draws one to its edge. The restaurants, they are few and far between, their lights flickering like beacons in the gloom, and the beach, it is naught but a stretch of stone, cold and unforgiving. Yet, in its rugged beauty, it holds a certain appeal, a certain wildness that speaks to the soul.",
            "In the heart of a southern settlement, a corridor between two serpentine thoroughfares, I find myself abiding. The perpetual hum of traffic, a ceaseless murmur, is the only intrusion upon our quietude. Neighbors are few and familiar, their faces as weathered as the ancient oaks that dot our wooded expanse. The winter brings a certain spectacle, children's laughter echoing through the crisp air as they careen down the hill that borders our street. Our abode stands sentinel at the corner, a vantage point from which we observe the ballet of life unfold. Strangers, those who venture into our domain, are noted with a historian's curiosity.\n\nThe encroaching encampment of humanity, a transient flow of vehicular life, has become an accepted part of the tapestry that is our existence. Our respite from the world lies within the sanctuary of our home, where the rhythm of life is dictated by the ticking of the clock and the whisper of the wind through the leaves. Four of us inhabit this space, myself and my spouse, our two daughters, their ages marking the passage of time like the rings of a tree. We tread upon these streets, a familiar dance, our presence as comforting to our neighbors as the scent of rain on earth.\n\nThe seasons have become a dance, each step measured and familiar. The autumn's breath, a whisper of change upon the air, is heralded by the crackle of burning leaves, a symphony of decay and rebirth. Winter's embrace is fleeting, a phantom's kiss upon the cheek, and we find ourselves in the relentless grip of a seemingly endless fall.\n\nThe garage, our private sanctuary, is a haven for the hands and the heart. It is here that I find solace, the clatter of tools and the hum of machinery a soothing melody. The front door, a relic of a bygone age, is seldom trodden, its key turning only when the rare stranger needs admission. Holidays, the grand celebrations of our existence, bring a temporary influx of life, the clatter of visiting cars a symphony of change. Thanksgiving, a time of feasting and fellowship, sees the neighborhood transformed into a temporary metropolis, a fleeting echo of the bustling world beyond. The same is true for the other holidays, Mother's Day and Christmas, each a moment of respite from the ceaseless dance of life.\n\nIn truth, our life is one of quietude, a gentle rhythm that mirrors the steady beat of the seasons. We are content, our roots deep in this soil, our eyes turned towards the horizon. If it weren't for the ceaseless hum of the thoroughfare, our life would be perfect, a whisper in the wind, a echo of the past, a promise of the future.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, I reside, where the land is naught but a vast expanse of dirt, stretching out as far as the eye can see. The soil, a constant companion, is a reminder of the unyielding harshness that has shaped this place. Few who have not experienced it can truly understand the relentless brown that dominates the landscape, punctuated only rarely by a patch of green, a testament to the prodigious efforts of those who tend to them. In the days of my youth, these lands were sparsely populated, but now, the city's encroachment is evident, new homes and businesses springing up with alarming frequency, transforming the once-wild expanse into something more akin to the sprawl of the city.\n\nThe people here are a mix of the old and the new. The elders, grizzled and weathered by the sun and time, offer a warmth that is genuine, while the newcomers, drawn by the promise of opportunity, bring with them a restless energy. It is a neighborhood that, despite its faults, hums with a quiet vitality. The stores that line the streets are a familiar array of chain establishments, their neon signs casting a garish glow over the dusty roads. For those who seek sustenance that is au naturel, travel is required, for the whole foods and the like are a rarity here.\n\nThe city's lifeblood is construction, a constant hum of activity, a testament to the untamed lands that still lie beyond the city's grip. This town, still young and eager, stands as a beacon of progress, a frontier where the wild frontier meets the encroaching metropolis. It is a place that I have come to love, a stark contrast to the concrete jungle I left behind.\n\nMy hands, calloused and rough, bear the marks of my trade, a drywall and T-bar installer. The desert has become a part of me, its winds and its silence a solace. The animals, too, have become part of our family. My children, with their eyes wide and wonder-filled, delight in the creatures that scamper and scurry in the shadows. They spend their days, and sometimes their nights, in pursuit of the lizards and beetles that call this place home.\n\nVictorville, our city, offers its share of delights. The San Bernardino County Fair is a spectacle not to be missed, a celebration of the peculiar charm that is Victorville. For those who seek the natural beauty of the desert, a trip to Wrightwood is a treat, the snow-capped mountains a stark contrast to the desert below. The Victor Valley Museum stands as a testament to the rich history of this land, a reminder of the hands that have shaped it, both human and non-human.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I find myself compelled to offer an answer that may seem peculiar to those more accustomed to the conventional concept of a neighborhood. Unlike many of my peers, my home is not a house with its own four walls, but rather the sprawling expanse of the campus that I call my own. The dormitories that I inhabit are my community, a place where the scent of age and familiarity permeates the halls like the smoke of a dying fire. The campus itself, with its stone buildings and echoes of laughter, serves as an extended neighborhood, though less intimate than those homes that lay beyond its walls.\n\nThe architecture of my neighborhood is varied and multifaceted, much like the people who inhabit it. There are the apartments, small and cramped but filled with life, where two or four inhabitants share a room, a small slice of existence. These buildings stand tall, like ancient sentinels, with floors as their bones and rooms as their flesh. Then there are the houses, scattered like islands in a sea of concrete, rented by alumni who have left their mark on these hallowed halls. They are few and far between, a relic of a different time, a time when homes were not merely transient lodgings but sanctuaries of memory. Finally, there are the dormitories, vast and impersonal, where hundreds of students are packed into rooms like sardines in a tin, their lives woven together in a tapestry of shared existence.\n\nThe people of my neighborhood are as diverse as the cultures they hail from, a testament to the school's pride in its inclusivity. They are a motley crew, a ragtag army of students, staff, and faculty, each with their own story etched into the lines of their face. The older students, those who have weathered the storm of academia, occupy the apartments, their laughter echoing through the halls like thunder. The newer students reside in the dormitories, their voices a symphony of youthful exuberance. And the professionals, those who keep the machine of academia running, live in the houses, their presence a reassuring beacon in the sea of youth.\n\nThe stores and parks of my neighborhood are a reflection of its unique character. They are a blend of the familiar and the novel, a mash-up of the everyday and the extraordinary. The stores offer a smorgasbord of culinary delights and unique retail therapy, while the park stands as a testament to the diverse people who call this place home. It is a green oasis, a playground for all, kept clean and safe by the collective efforts of its inhabitants, a symbol of the community that thrives here.",
            "In the vicinity of a decade, I've dwelt in these confines. When I arrived, a boy from Riverdale, I wept for the familiarity lost, for the love I left behind. My parents, they sought a better life for my sister and me, a safer haven, a place where the word \"ghetto\" was not whispered. I grew accustomed to the anonymity of Stockbridge, forged friendships, and bore the brunt of enmity. Mr. Glen's family and Dennis, our neighbors, became fixtures in my life, their kindness a balm to my alienation.\n\nI recall the day of Mr. Glen's nuptials, a jubilee in my humble existence. Ms. Veda, her white garter gleaming like a relic, was my prize, though the flowers eluded me. We danced under the light of the moon, and Marsharii, her laughter a melody, was a joy to my soul. But time, that relentless river, has since carried her away.\n\nThis neighborhood, a labyrinth, now navigated with the aid of a mechanical guide, has revealed itself to me in fits and starts. With Kason and Curtis, my brethren in spirit, I've traversed it's boundaries, our laughter echoing through the streets. We've spent hours in pursuit of pixels, our souls entwined in the dance of digital worlds. I've found solace in the park, a sanctuary where nature's whispers soothe my spirit. There, I've practiced my balance with sticks from Home Depot, my bokken sword a symbol of my unyielding pursuit of mastery. The basketball and tennis courts, silent sentinels of my youth, await my return, perhaps a day when the spirit of Mr. Graves' tutelage stirs me once more. There's a wealth of memories here, a tapestry of joy and sorrow, and as I stand on the precipice of manhood, I anticipate the dawn of a new chapter.",
            "My dwelling lies in proximity to the institution of learning I frequent, a circumstance I find most convenient. The neighborhood is mostly comprised of tenements, with a smattering of taverns and eateries that offer respite and sustenance. One such establishment has recently seen a change in nomenclature, and while its prices have climbed, the service and libations remain unexceptional. The denizens of this realm are largely a blend of collegiates and those of lesser means, drawn by the affordable lodging. A school for the young stands near, its presence a constant hum in the air. My neighbors, I have not come to know, nor have I sought their acquaintance, for they are given to the indulgence of hemp, and the management has seen fit to employ an air freshener to counter their scent, a circumstance we find amusing, yet somewhat insulting. The buildings surrounding me are weathered, though their interiors may have been renewed. Down the thoroughfare, newer dwellings have sprung up, yet their construction is suspect, and rent is exorbitant, a scam that is tolerated due to their proximity to the university. In the vicinity, a humble eatery offers sustenance at a cost, and across from it, a gas station hums with life, though its reputation is less than stellar. The city has seen fit to restore the road, gifting us with a wide sidewalk, verdant medians, and a improved appearance. Yet, the apartment complex I inhabit is shrouded in trees, a few of which have been felled, leaving stumps in their wake. Behind my residence lies a dense wood, and beyond it, another complex of dwellings. My address is 42nd Street, but 43rd, just beyond, is less favorable, with crumbling sidewalks and dilapidated structures, the former hidden by the latter's foliage. Crime is not uncommon, and I cannot lay the blame solely at the feet of the nearby apartments, for those across the way are no different. Yet, I find solace in my residence, for it is within my means, and the necessities of life are nearby. The university is but a stroll away, and two bus stops provide easy access to the market and the city's heart.",
            "My abode lies in a cul-de-sac of duplexes, spaced like some kind of sprawling, yellow-bricked, white-porched, green-roofed settlement. The neighborhood is a peculiar blend of familiarity and isolation, where the wind hums through the tall grass and the children's laughter is a distant echo. We gather at the end of the not-by-chance driveway on some evenings, engaging in idle chatter while the little ones play with their trinkets or launch kites into the vast, blue sky. It is a respite from the relentless hum of modernity, a step into the past, where the world seems simpler, more manageable.\n\nThe fields and trees that surround us, painted with the colors of a child's dream, bear witness to the changing seasons. But nature is fickle, and this season has brought with it a new visitor: the tornado. Last night, the sky darkened, and we were forced to seek shelter, the storm's fury echoing in the distance like a dying beast's anguished cry. My small dog, trembling, curled up in the bathtub with me, a pitiful sight, as I clutched him and my purse, the only comfort in the storm's chaos. My larger dog, however, refused to join us, pacing nervously in the living room, his barks a stark contrast to the hushed silence of the neighborhood. The sky lit up with flashes of lightning, and the sound of hail was like the pounding of a thousand war drums. The ground steamed as the temperature plummeted, the hail melting into pools of water as it hit the hot pavement. And then, as swiftly as it had come, the storm cleared, leaving behind a double rainbow.\n\nThe neighborhood was quiet, the only sound the distant hum of a lawn mower or the crackle of a radio. I rushed back inside, camera in hand, snapping photographs of the spectacle, eager to share it with my family and friends. The sudden appearance of this double rainbow was a sign, a reminder of the beauty that can be found in the most unexpected of places. The storm was soon forgotten, the neighborhood returning to its peaceful state, the children playing, mothers calling them inside for dinner. I am new to this place, having moved from the cold embrace of New Hampshire to the warm, friendly arms of North Carolina. My apartment is small, like those of my neighbors, but it is home. The farms that surround us are a testament to a simpler time, the roosters' morning song a welcome alarm, and the donkey's evening bray a comforting lullaby. It is a gem of a neighborhood, a hidden pocket of tranquility in the vast expanse of the modern world.",
            "I relocated to these parts as the sun dipped low on my eighth-grade debut. The streets were strange, and friendships were slow to form. Yet, the boy two houses down and the lad who dwelt on my avenue became my companions. They've since moved on, as have many who once called this place home. The faces may have changed, but the spirit of the neighborhood remains much the same. A far cry from the wilds, yet not so tame that one feels lost. The houses stand in rows, two stories tall, a quiet testament to the suburban life that unfolds within.\n\nThe weekends echo with the laughter of children, a stark contrast to the weekday hush. I've known no trouble here, save for the occasional prank. Packages left on my porch have never disappeared, and the neighbors I've come to trust. Just as the sun of a new day breaks, so too does the quiet give way to the hum of activity.\n\nA park lies just beyond my doorstep, a place of both joy and sorrow. There, I've played football, baseball, even basketball. Yet, it was there too that the unforgiving elbow of a boy named Jake left a mark on my face, a testament to the bittersweet nature of youth. Now, the park is a place of respite, where I watch the cousins of my kin play on swings and slides, their laughter echoing the joy of my own youth. The park, it stirs memories deep within, a reminder of the passage of time and the indelible mark it leaves.\n\nThe neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity, woven with the threads of food from distant lands. Just a stone's throw away, one can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian fare. The aroma of these culinary delights fills the air, a constant reminder of the world beyond our doorstep. Yet, in this age of convenience, apps like GrubHub and DoorDash have become the new marketplace, delivering sustenance to our doorstep. The fast food joints are ever-present, a testament to the indomitable spirit of convenience. Pizza, they say, is the universal language, and here it is spoken fluently.\n\nThe stores, they provide all that one could need. Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco, even an Indian store for those who yearn for the spices of home. The spirit of diversity is alive and well here, a beacon of hope in a world that so often seems divided. I am grateful for this place, for the quiet, for the laughter, for the memories. And so, I stand here, a child of this neighborhood, a witness to its evolution, a guardian of its spirit. For in these times of strife and turmoil, it is places like this that remind us of the courage of the human heart, unyielding and resilient.",
            "In the quiet expanse of South Carolina, there lies a town named Johnston, a place that doesn't so much stand out as simply exist. It's a place where the land is dominated by the golden glow of peach orchards and the verdant sprawl of cattle pastures. The homes here are few and far between, spaced out like the teeth on a worn comb, with either metal roofs that glint in the sun or gray shingles that whisper tales of the years. The main drag is a four-way intersection where the single stoplight hangs like a grim sentinel, watching over the town's scant mercantile offerings.\n\nThere's a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican eatery, and a burger joint, but they're not much more than a speck on the map. A pizzeria once was, but it's long since closed, leaving behind a void that's been filled by the humdrum of the everyday. The pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is renowned for its cherry Coke, a sweet reminder of simpler times. The grocery store, IGA, is small and expensive, a stop to grab a few things before the long drive to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General, however, is a fixture, bustling with the everyday necessities of life.\n\nThe only furniture store, Possibilities, is run by a woman known and loved by the community. Attached is a pet groomers, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where the low hum of clippers and the occasional bark of a dog create a symphony of sorts. Medical care is a short drive away, and the school, Johnston Elementary, is the heart of the town's youth. Beyond that, there's not much to do. No movie theaters, no bowling alleys, no parks. Just the slow, steady pulse of life in a place that's so small, you could blink and miss it.",
            "The first time I'd heard the whisper of my abode, it was in the hushed tones of a podcast that spoke of the vanished. The price of such a place, a thousand dollars a month, was a shock. I'd never known of such a tale, nor had any of my kin. Perhaps it's the burden of these times. I've seen friends weep into their pillows, their dreams crushed beneath the weight of expense. We've learned the art of frugality, we have. The funk of secondhand treasures stirs us, the dust of forgotten days clinging to our skin. We smell less in adulthood, we do, but the stench of the new world is always there, a constant reminder of our plight. We walk the streets, the thrift shops our temples, the silence our sanctuary. The city grows, they say, with each passing day, a beast of steel and glass, yet the thrifts remain untouched, oases of quiet amidst the storm. The piano next door, the voices of friends above, a symphony of life that plays on even in the darkest of nights. This place, it's not like the South, where concern is a badge of honor. Here, we mind our own business, we do. We keep our shells, our secrets, and the city goes on, indifferent, a tide that crashes and recedes, leaving only the sand of our existence. I am fortunate to be here, I am. Most of my neighbors, they are not so bad. They leave food, they bring mail, they share a smile. We are not strangers, not truly. We are, in a way, a family, bound by the shared burden of existence. In the vast, cold expanse of this modern world, it's the people who make the place feel like home.",
            "The expanse wherein I dwell is a monotony of suburban sameness, a cookie-cutter landscape where the hand of man has left its mark in the form of a homeowner's association. As you enter, the uniformity is stark: rows upon rows of well-maintained, single-family abodes. The front yards are mere stages for a prescribed tableau of greenery, stone, and compact driveways, interspersed with the occasional sapling. Each residence boasts a two-car garage, a testament to the American dream. The streets are a ribbon of newly laid concrete, unblemished by neglect or decay. The houses, predominantly single-story, occasionally ascend to two, like a rare, unruly exception to the rule. Mailboxes are not to be found in their customary positions; instead, they're congregated at the end of the street, a communal necessity guarded by a lock and key. The neighborhood, though part of a sprawling metropolis, retains a sense of rural calm, with ample space for life to unfold at a measured pace. Community pools, maintained with an almost militaristic precision, and walking trails that wind through the parcelled land, all bear testament to the HOA's obsession with order. The populace is a mix of retirees and professionals, bound together by shared responsibility for the community. The city is a beast of contradictions, large in population yet small in heart, a place where one can find every amenity under the sun. My home is a fifteen-minute drive from the town's single, modest mall, where one can indulge in the pleasures of modern commerce. Yet, even if the conveniences of the world are a mere drive away, the neighborhood remains a sanctuary of safety, comfort, and mutual respect.",
            "In the heart of a Midwestern town, just beyond the sprawl of a great city's suburbs, I reside. The east side, where my home stands, bears the brunt of economic hardship. The dwellings, mostly rentals, are modest, their owners often among the town's poorest. Yet, there is a certain charm, and the neighbors, weathered by time and toil, greet you with a nod and a smile. Crime, though not dormant, is a quiet beast, with only a few isolated incidents marring the peace - a shooting here, a homicide there. Our neighbors mourned a lost son, taken by a bar's harsh light and dark shadow. My family's encounter with it has been limited to trinkets vanishing from our porch. The opioid scourge has laid claim to many lives, but the town fights back with resources aplenty - rehab centers, Narcan training sessions. The school, despite its humble beginnings, nurtures my son's mind and heart. It is a haven, where special needs are met with kindness, and no child goes hungry. The PTO, a beacon of hope, organizes events that keep the town's spirit alive. Yet, the improvements, while evident in the town's center and west, have not graced our east side. The Council, blind to our plight, favors popular shops and traffic-laden thoroughfares. Despite all, we love our town, its comforts, its familiarity. Our home, though humble, is ours, and our family, with over sixteen years here, cannot imagine leaving.",
            "My neighborhood, a tapestry woven with the threads of history, unfurls across the hill, cradled between ancient edifices. My dwelling, a seven-story monolith, stands sentinel across from the venerable live Theater, its stage silent no more. A stone's throw away, a block down the hill, lies an arcade bar, a beacon for the city's denizens on balmy summer nights. Lines form, stretching like a leash of eager bodies, drawn to the promise of respite and camaraderie in the warm embrace of twilight. A few blocks up, the city park sprawls, a verdant oasis encircled by concrete and stairs, worn smooth by time and use. In the winter's icy grasp, the homeless take refuge in neat, if temporary, rows along the sidewalk, their tents huddled for warmth against the relentless rain. The city, it seems, does not discriminate, offering succor to those left to the cold and the wet. It is a land of stark contrasts, where the ghosts of violence echo through the streets, the memories of federal intervention still fresh in the shared consciousness. Yet, the people of Hilltop still toil, their labor a testament to their resilience, their pride in their neighborhood unwavering. They guard their streets, their alleys, their homes, their hearts. For they know the dark past that haunts these streets, the whispers of a time when the hilltop was a crown of flames, a crown of fear. They know the whispers of a time when a color of skin could seal one's fate, when the city's promise was but a distant dream. They know the whispers, and they will not forget. Yet, they also know the kindness that can temper the harsh edges of such a past, the kindness that can be found in the eyes of a stranger, in the hand that offers a jacket, a smile, a dollar bill. This is my neighborhood, my home, my Hilltop. A place that breathes, lives, loves, and remembers.",
            "In the heart of rural Michigan, I call home a small, unassuming town. A place where the horizon is painted with fields of grain and the horizon is never far away. The city is absent, save for a few landmarks that serve the community's simple needs. No glistening malls or corporate giants of commerce, only the necessities of life: a humble grocery store, a post office, and a single, dilapidated cinema that shows films long since forgotten.\n\nThe town is encircled by waters, like a island in the midst of a placid lake. To the east, the vast expanse of Lake Michigan mirrors the sky, and to the west, the serene Lake Charlevoix. The homes, they are a patchwork of history and nostalgia, each one unique, with basements visible from the street, like the doors to another world. Aluminum siding in hues of tired blue and rusted red, a testament to the years that have passed. Yards, small and well-tended, with trampolines and makeshift forts for the children who play freely, unfettered by the constraints of urban life.\n\nThe people, they are the heart of this place. Hardworking folks, their faces etched with the lines of a life spent in service to the land. Neighbors greet each other with a nod, a wave, or a friendly bark from a dog. The lawns, they are not landscaped with precision, but kept fresh and green, a testament to the pride that comes with owning a home.\n\nThe town, it is quiet, peaceful, and safe. The Sheriff's Department, the Health Department, they stand as silent sentinels, their presence reassuring, not intimidating. The baseball field, the airport, the ice cream shop, each one a part of the town's tapestry, each one a place where memories are made.\n\nThis is not a place of grand architecture or bustling streets, but it is a place of simple beauty. A place where the sun sets in a blaze of color, where the wind whispers through the trees, and where the sound of a child's laughter is the sweetest melody. It is a place where you can walk down the street and feel the spirit of community. It is a place where you can raise a family, and that, in its own humble way, is something truly special."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In this sprawling metropolis, my abode finds itself amidst a tapestry of stark contrasts - bustling commercial districts and tranquil residential pockets, all woven together like some grand, chaotic quilt. Towering office blocks and quaint, independent stores vie for attention, their wares enticing the eye and beckoning the purse. The aroma of a thousand cuisines wafts through the air, each a testament to the city's cosmopolitan soul. Yet, beneath the veneer of progress lies a more mundane truth: traffic, a ceaseless, lumbering beast, chokes the arteries of this urban jungle, as if the very city itself is struggling to breathe.\n\nThere are oases of green too, though modest, where children play and laughter rings out, a stark reminder of the life that persists amidst the concrete and steel. The faces that populate these streets are a mosaic of humanity, each a canvas upon which the hand of time has drawn lines of history. In one corner, the flags of pride fly high, while another bears the steadfast gaze of the pious. From the east, the streets echo with the cadence of languages long lost to the wind of change, and from the west, the echoes of hope and resilience resonate. Yet, despite the diversity, the city's heart remains a cold one, its people strangers to one another, bound only by the common thread of their shared existence.\n\nHouses too, in this city, bear the marks of time and the varied tastes of their inhabitants. From grand edifices that scrape the heavens to small, humble abodes nestled among the trees, each tells a story of the lives that have passed through its doors. And the people? They too are as varied as the city itself, a tapestry of youth and age, laughter and silence. I know not the majority of my neighbors, for in this city, the passage of time has scattered us like leaves on the wind. Yet, in the quiet corners of my memory, there are echoes of a simpler time, when the world was smaller, and the city's pulse was slower, when laughter could be heard echoing through the streets, and the neighbor's door was always open.",
            "In this enclave of suburban America, where the remnants of a once-glorious dream persist, I find myself ensconced in a neighborhood that whispers tales of a time not so long ago. The houses stand as sentinels, some solitary, others joined in a dance of collective memory. My home, like its kin, bears the unmistakable mark of an era when the American dream was a beacon, its promise echoing through the streets. Yet, this dream has grown distant, its luster faded, and the optimism that once filled these streets now lies dormant, like the untended yards that stretch out before us.\n\nThe public school, a monolith of history, stands sentinel, its halls echoing with tales of a future yet to be written. The churches, once the heart of this community, now lie mostly empty, their silence a testament to the passage of time. The basketball courts, however, remain a sanctuary, a place where the youth still find solace, their laughter a stark contrast to the quiet streets.\n\nThe faces of the neighborhood are a tapestry of African American residents, their stories woven into the very fabric of this place. There is a supermarket, \"Super A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, a beacon of diversity amidst the homogeneity. The youth still play in the streets, their laughter a symphony that drowns out the distant hum of the expressway, which passes through our town, but not our streets. The elders, their voices echoing with the weight of generations, hold onto the past, their hands gripping tightly to the remnants of a simpler time.\n\nA new high school is rising, a symbol of hope for the future, yet the choice of a mascot remains a topic of contention. Some suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin, a representation of our town's unique blend of the old and the new. But for now, the dream persists, a flickering flame in the darkness of time, a testament to the enduring spirit of this place.",

A glance might deceive one to pass it by, for it is tucked away behind a desolate strip of commerce, far from the eyes of the many. Yet, to brave the passage beyond the forsaken Whole Foods and the annual haunts of the hotels, one finds a sanctuary alive with the rhythm of life. Here, amidst the decrepit remnants of a forgotten era, the apartments stand in a line, like the bones of some long-dead beast, their stories whispered in the breeze. The first few, notorious for their dark deeds, hold little interest for the curious; for appearances can be deceiving. But beyond them, the world shifts, and the veritable heart of this place beats strong.\n\nThe satellite campus of the college lies across the way, its quiet sentinels of education standing sentinel, admitting students one by one, their coffee cups a beacon of hope in the early morning gloom. The road, a serpent of asphalt, forks into another life, where the golden gates of a rehabilitation center creak open to welcome the injured, their cheerful porches a stark contrast to the faded paint of the apartments. Children, like tiny, reckless spirits, dance across the green expanse, their laughter echoing through the thick, warm air. Old timers, their faces etched with the lines of history, walk their dogs along the path, their eyes holding a world of stories untold. The strip mall, a humble haven of commerce, houses a sushi place that feeds the hungry, a swimming supply store that caters to the carefree, and a nail salon where the hands of the weary find solace.

            "\"Where, then, is everything?\" she inquired as we traversed the vast expanse of cornfields stretching out before us. \"This,\" I replied, \"is the place of my birth, a land where the open sky is the only horizon and the cornfields are the only sentinels. She hailed from a town where the grocery store was but a stone's throw away from her home, and the sight of so much open space left her awestruck, as if she had stumbled upon some foreign territory. I regaled her with tales of my upbringing in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood. We rumbled along a two-lane country road, the sun glinting off the water in the quarry, a serene body of stillness that held within it the secrets of time.

Out back, a stream whispers secrets to the quarry, and the trees stand sentinel, their leaves rustling tales of the bullfrogs' songs and the distant \"moo\" of the farm animals. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies a sanctuary of nature, untouched and wild, where I spent my childhood. From building forts to the art of 'hunting,' there was always a neighbor child to call a friend. The winters can be cruel, yet they paint the landscape in hues of white and gray, a stark beauty that transforms the backyard into a winter wonderland. Snow angels and snowmen adorn the scene, and the occasional snowfall brings a sense of peace, as my sister and I, once inseparable, now fought with snowballs, and built igloos that served as our arsenal.

            "The first thing one must comprehend about Portland, Oregon is its peculiarity. The city's unofficial slogan, etched on a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music den, and skirts the line of legality in most of these aspects, reads, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it's a nostalgic cry for the Portland of yore, a time when the city was less known and more affordable, giving rise to unique and creative subcultures. To others, it's a siren call - come to Portland, where being odd is not only accepted but celebrated. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the ceaseless construction of condominiums to house them, Portland remains, at its core, peculiar. Peculiarity is not always an embrace, but it is an acceptance of things that are not normally accepted. Portland is no stranger to modern conveniences and modern strife, borrowing most of its goods from far-off lands. It is filled with a multitude of ways to be peculiar, yet it houses its share of normalcy - yoga and hipsters and business folk. Perhaps peculiarity is merely the taking of these things less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland ones, you'll find colorful houses, gardens filled with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. These are not just cardboard boxes containing unwanted items, but containers of magic, a treasure waiting for the wandering soul. They hold clothes, books, or anything else. The magic of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. To me, at least, but I am merely one variety of peculiar among countless others. Some in my midst would never consider rummaging through a box on the sidewalk for their attire. They are drawn to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real, live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is filled with people who love all sorts of things. It is a city of dreamers, some of them chasing their dreams, others merely dreaming while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drugs are often a symptom (at their source) of mental illness, and the relentless rain through much of the year, coupled with the dull clouds, seem to contribute to this. Portland also struggles with homelessness, a problem that seems insurmountable. The homeless are drawn by the city's social services, more generous than in many parts of the country, but still insufficient. The non-homeless population oscillates between care and disdain. In this, Portland is not peculiar at all.",
            "The peaks stand sentinel, ever-present, silent witnesses to the ceaseless dance of day and night. They do not yield, nor do they bend to the whims of time or the tumultuous tides of life. Even when I am swallowed by the mundane, they remain, steadfast and unyielding. Yet, on days when the weight of existence bears down upon me, they call out to me, demanding to be acknowledged. When I turn to them, they offer respite, a moment of quiet amidst the storm, lending me strength for another day's trek. It was in the crucible of my first year of study that I first beheld them, those distant titans of stone and ice, and since then, they have held a peculiar sway over my soul. The campus, with its grand edifices and tranquil ponds, holds its own charms, but it is the mountains that command my reverence. The town, too, has its allure, with its venerable buildings and bustling commerce, yet it is the mountains that offer solace. They stand as a beacon, a reminder of the immutable, a testament to the unyielding. The paths they trace through the sky are etched with the hues of sunset, and when I find myself wandering amidst their shadows, I am reminded of the eternal. Whether I am lost in thought or lost in heartache, they are always there, silent and steadfast, a silent testament to the enduring. The ponds, too, reflect this timelessness, their surfaces shimmering with the light of day and the shadows of night. It is amidst their still waters that I often find myself, pondering the enigma of existence, the intricate dance of the tides of life. As the sun ascends, it illuminates the palm trees, casting their shadows upon the earth, and I am reminded of the path I walk. For I am walking north, towards the mountains, towards the unyielding, towards the eternal. They stand as a promise, a promise of steadfastness, of perseverance, of the unending. They are the mountains, and they are always there, waiting, watching, unwavering.",

Just round the corner from where I stand, there be four such markets within spittin' distance, their convenience a blessing to those who dwell here.

Bullies and thieves, they lurk in the shadows, stealing what they will. And the dogs, they be a problem, their waste strewn about like a plague. A fine exists for those who leave their mark uncleaned, yet the rule be often broken. Keep thy eyes open, and thy shoes clean, for this be Bensonhurst.",
            "In this place, there be few paths for walking as such. All seems to slump and slide beneath the weight of time, and my dwelling sits atop the highest point, a vantage such that it commands a view over all else. They speak of it as the \"work out hill,\" for the many a jogger who seek to ascend its incline in pursuit of their daily regimen. The road is naught but a stretch of pitted, weathered stone, treacherous and unyielding to the tread of feet or wheels. The wires that trace the path, bearing the burden of man's commerce with the heavens, hang loose and rent, their tattered ends swaying in the constant breeze. The rain and the storms, they take their toll, their relentless assault carving the landscape anew with each passing season. The trees, great sentinels of green, stand tall and proud, yet the folk here scorn them. They cut down as many as they can, their eyes fixed upon the horizon, the ocean's embrace. The houses, they rise up and up, their glass eyes turned outward, drinking in the sight of the bay, a scene of such beauty it takes the breath from one's lungs. Yet, the skies are oft shrouded in grey, the sun's light filtered through a veil of mist and damp. The world grows green and furred with moss, creeping over all that stands still for long enough. My own conveyance, left to its own devices, turned to green before my eyes, its once sleek lines now obscured by the hungry tendrils of nature. Few children do there live, but many a dog does prowl the streets, their barks echoing through the empty lots. The gardens, they are ravaged by the rabbits, their burrows marring the earth, and the crows, they chase away the birds of prey, their cawing a symphony of chaos. The water, it is tepid, the rocks mere pebbles in its embrace, yet still, it holds a certain charm, a certain allure that draws one to its edge. The restaurants, they are few and far between, their lights flickering like beacons in the gloom, and the beach, it is naught but a stretch of stone, cold and unforgiving. Yet, in its rugged beauty, it holds a certain appeal, a certain wildness that speaks to the soul.",
            "In the heart of a southern settlement, a corridor between two serpentine thoroughfares, I find myself abiding. The perpetual hum of traffic, a ceaseless murmur, is the only intrusion upon our quietude. Neighbors are few and familiar, their faces as weathered as the ancient oaks that dot our wooded expanse. The winter brings a certain spectacle, children's laughter echoing through the crisp air as they careen down the hill that borders our street. Our abode stands sentinel at the corner, a vantage point from which we observe the ballet of life unfold. Strangers, those who venture into our domain, are noted with a historian's curiosity.\n\nThe encroaching encampment of humanity, a transient flow of vehicular life, has become an accepted part of the tapestry that is our existence. Our respite from the world lies within the sanctuary of our home, where the rhythm of life is dictated by the ticking of the clock and the whisper of the wind through the leaves. Four of us inhabit this space, myself and my spouse, our two daughters, their ages marking the passage of time like the rings of a tree. We tread upon these streets, a familiar dance, our presence as comforting to our neighbors as the scent of rain on earth.\n\nThe seasons have become a dance, each step measured and familiar. The autumn's breath, a whisper of change upon the air, is heralded by the crackle of burning leaves, a symphony of decay and rebirth. Winter's embrace is fleeting, a phantom's kiss upon the cheek, and we find ourselves in the relentless grip of a seemingly endless fall.\n\nThe garage, our private sanctuary, is a haven for the hands and the heart. It is here that I find solace, the clatter of tools and the hum of machinery a soothing melody. The front door, a relic of a bygone age, is seldom trodden, its key turning only when the rare stranger needs admission. Holidays, the grand celebrations of our existence, bring a temporary influx of life, the clatter of visiting cars a symphony of change. Thanksgiving, a time of feasting and fellowship, sees the neighborhood transformed into a temporary metropolis, a fleeting echo of the bustling world beyond. The same is true for the other holidays, Mother's Day and Christmas, each a moment of respite from the ceaseless dance of life.\n\nIn truth, our life is one of quietude, a gentle rhythm that mirrors the steady beat of the seasons. We are content, our roots deep in this soil, our eyes turned towards the horizon. If it weren't for the ceaseless hum of the thoroughfare, our life would be perfect, a whisper in the wind, a echo of the past, a promise of the future.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, I reside, where the land is naught but a vast expanse of dirt, stretching out as far as the eye can see. The soil, a constant companion, is a reminder of the unyielding harshness that has shaped this place. Few who have not experienced it can truly understand the relentless brown that dominates the landscape, punctuated only rarely by a patch of green, a testament to the prodigious efforts of those who tend to them. In the days of my youth, these lands were sparsely populated, but now, the city's encroachment is evident, new homes and businesses springing up with alarming frequency, transforming the once-wild expanse into something more akin to the sprawl of the city.\n\nThe people here are a mix of the old and the new. The elders, grizzled and weathered by the sun and time, offer a warmth that is genuine, while the newcomers, drawn by the promise of opportunity, bring with them a restless energy. It is a neighborhood that, despite its faults, hums with a quiet vitality. The stores that line the streets are a familiar array of chain establishments, their neon signs casting a garish glow over the dusty roads. For those who seek sustenance that is au naturel, travel is required, for the whole foods and the like are a rarity here.\n\nThe city's lifeblood is construction, a constant hum of activity, a testament to the untamed lands that still lie beyond the city's grip. This town, still young and eager, stands as a beacon of progress, a frontier where the wild frontier meets the encroaching metropolis. It is a place that I have come to love, a stark contrast to the concrete jungle I left behind.\n\nMy hands, calloused and rough, bear the marks of my trade, a drywall and T-bar installer. The desert has become a part of me, its winds and its silence a solace. The animals, too, have become part of our family. My children, with their eyes wide and wonder-filled, delight in the creatures that scamper and scurry in the shadows. They spend their days, and sometimes their nights, in pursuit of the lizards and beetles that call this place home.\n\nVictorville, our city, offers its share of delights. The San Bernardino County Fair is a spectacle not to be missed, a celebration of the peculiar charm that is Victorville. For those who seek the natural beauty of the desert, a trip to Wrightwood is a treat, the snow-capped mountains a stark contrast to the desert below. The Victor Valley Museum stands as a testament to the rich history of this land, a reminder of the hands that have shaped it, both human and non-human.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I find myself compelled to offer an answer that may seem peculiar to those more accustomed to the conventional concept of a neighborhood. Unlike many of my peers, my home is not a house with its own four walls, but rather the sprawling expanse of the campus that I call my own. The dormitories that I inhabit are my community, a place where the scent of age and familiarity permeates the halls like the smoke of a dying fire. The campus itself, with its stone buildings and echoes of laughter, serves as an extended neighborhood, though less intimate than those homes that lay beyond its walls.\n\nThe architecture of my neighborhood is varied and multifaceted, much like the people who inhabit it. There are the apartments, small and cramped but filled with life, where two or four inhabitants share a room, a small slice of existence. These buildings stand tall, like ancient sentinels, with floors as their bones and rooms as their flesh. Then there are the houses, scattered like islands in a sea of concrete, rented by alumni who have left their mark on these hallowed halls. They are few and far between, a relic of a different time, a time when homes were not merely transient lodgings but sanctuaries of memory. Finally, there are the dormitories, vast and impersonal, where hundreds of students are packed into rooms like sardines in a tin, their lives woven together in a tapestry of shared existence.\n\nThe people of my neighborhood are as diverse as the cultures they hail from, a testament to the school's pride in its inclusivity. They are a motley crew, a ragtag army of students, staff, and faculty, each with their own story etched into the lines of their face. The older students, those who have weathered the storm of academia, occupy the apartments, their laughter echoing through the halls like thunder. The newer students reside in the dormitories, their voices a symphony of youthful exuberance. And the professionals, those who keep the machine of academia running, live in the houses, their presence a reassuring beacon in the sea of youth.\n\nThe stores and parks of my neighborhood are a reflection of its unique character. They are a blend of the familiar and the novel, a mash-up of the everyday and the extraordinary. The stores offer a smorgasbord of culinary delights and unique retail therapy, while the park stands as a testament to the diverse people who call this place home. It is a green oasis, a playground for all, kept clean and safe by the collective efforts of its inhabitants, a symbol of the community that thrives here.",
            "In the vicinity of a decade, I've dwelt in these confines. When I arrived, a boy from Riverdale, I wept for the familiarity lost, for the love I left behind. My parents, they sought a better life for my sister and me, a safer haven, a place where the word \"ghetto\" was not whispered. I grew accustomed to the anonymity of Stockbridge, forged friendships, and bore the brunt of enmity. Mr. Glen's family and Dennis, our neighbors, became fixtures in my life, their kindness a balm to my alienation.\n\nI recall the day of Mr. Glen's nuptials, a jubilee in my humble existence. Ms. Veda, her white garter gleaming like a relic, was my prize, though the flowers eluded me. We danced under the light of the moon, and Marsharii, her laughter a melody, was a joy to my soul. But time, that relentless river, has since carried her away.\n\nThis neighborhood, a labyrinth, now navigated with the aid of a mechanical guide, has revealed itself to me in fits and starts. With Kason and Curtis, my brethren in spirit, I've traversed it's boundaries, our laughter echoing through the streets. We've spent hours in pursuit of pixels, our souls entwined in the dance of digital worlds. I've found solace in the park, a sanctuary where nature's whispers soothe my spirit. There, I've practiced my balance with sticks from Home Depot, my bokken sword a symbol of my unyielding pursuit of mastery. The basketball and tennis courts, silent sentinels of my youth, await my return, perhaps a day when the spirit of Mr. Graves' tutelage stirs me once more. There's a wealth of memories here, a tapestry of joy and sorrow, and as I stand on the precipice of manhood, I anticipate the dawn of a new chapter.",
            "My dwelling lies in proximity to the institution of learning I frequent, a circumstance I find most convenient. The neighborhood is mostly comprised of tenements, with a smattering of taverns and eateries that offer respite and sustenance. One such establishment has recently seen a change in nomenclature, and while its prices have climbed, the service and libations remain unexceptional. The denizens of this realm are largely a blend of collegiates and those of lesser means, drawn by the affordable lodging. A school for the young stands near, its presence a constant hum in the air. My neighbors, I have not come to know, nor have I sought their acquaintance, for they are given to the indulgence of hemp, and the management has seen fit to employ an air freshener to counter their scent, a circumstance we find amusing, yet somewhat insulting. The buildings surrounding me are weathered, though their interiors may have been renewed. Down the thoroughfare, newer dwellings have sprung up, yet their construction is suspect, and rent is exorbitant, a scam that is tolerated due to their proximity to the university. In the vicinity, a humble eatery offers sustenance at a cost, and across from it, a gas station hums with life, though its reputation is less than stellar. The city has seen fit to restore the road, gifting us with a wide sidewalk, verdant medians, and a improved appearance. Yet, the apartment complex I inhabit is shrouded in trees, a few of which have been felled, leaving stumps in their wake. Behind my residence lies a dense wood, and beyond it, another complex of dwellings. My address is 42nd Street, but 43rd, just beyond, is less favorable, with crumbling sidewalks and dilapidated structures, the former hidden by the latter's foliage. Crime is not uncommon, and I cannot lay the blame solely at the feet of the nearby apartments, for those across the way are no different. Yet, I find solace in my residence, for it is within my means, and the necessities of life are nearby. The university is but a stroll away, and two bus stops provide easy access to the market and the city's heart.",
            "My abode lies in a cul-de-sac of duplexes, spaced like some kind of sprawling, yellow-bricked, white-porched, green-roofed settlement. The neighborhood is a peculiar blend of familiarity and isolation, where the wind hums through the tall grass and the children's laughter is a distant echo. We gather at the end of the not-by-chance driveway on some evenings, engaging in idle chatter while the little ones play with their trinkets or launch kites into the vast, blue sky. It is a respite from the relentless hum of modernity, a step into the past, where the world seems simpler, more manageable.\n\nThe fields and trees that surround us, painted with the colors of a child's dream, bear witness to the changing seasons. But nature is fickle, and this season has brought with it a new visitor: the tornado. Last night, the sky darkened, and we were forced to seek shelter, the storm's fury echoing in the distance like a dying beast's anguished cry. My small dog, trembling, curled up in the bathtub with me, a pitiful sight, as I clutched him and my purse, the only comfort in the storm's chaos. My larger dog, however, refused to join us, pacing nervously in the living room, his barks a stark contrast to the hushed silence of the neighborhood. The sky lit up with flashes of lightning, and the sound of hail was like the pounding of a thousand war drums. The ground steamed as the temperature plummeted, the hail melting into pools of water as it hit the hot pavement. And then, as swiftly as it had come, the storm cleared, leaving behind a double rainbow.\n\nThe neighborhood was quiet, the only sound the distant hum of a lawn mower or the crackle of a radio. I rushed back inside, camera in hand, snapping photographs of the spectacle, eager to share it with my family and friends. The sudden appearance of this double rainbow was a sign, a reminder of the beauty that can be found in the most unexpected of places. The storm was soon forgotten, the neighborhood returning to its peaceful state, the children playing, mothers calling them inside for dinner. I am new to this place, having moved from the cold embrace of New Hampshire to the warm, friendly arms of North Carolina. My apartment is small, like those of my neighbors, but it is home. The farms that surround us are a testament to a simpler time, the roosters' morning song a welcome alarm, and the donkey's evening bray a comforting lullaby. It is a gem of a neighborhood, a hidden pocket of tranquility in the vast expanse of the modern world.",
            "I relocated to these parts as the sun dipped low on my eighth-grade debut. The streets were strange, and friendships were slow to form. Yet, the boy two houses down and the lad who dwelt on my avenue became my companions. They've since moved on, as have many who once called this place home. The faces may have changed, but the spirit of the neighborhood remains much the same. A far cry from the wilds, yet not so tame that one feels lost. The houses stand in rows, two stories tall, a quiet testament to the suburban life that unfolds within.\n\nThe weekends echo with the laughter of children, a stark contrast to the weekday hush. I've known no trouble here, save for the occasional prank. Packages left on my porch have never disappeared, and the neighbors I've come to trust. Just as the sun of a new day breaks, so too does the quiet give way to the hum of activity.\n\nA park lies just beyond my doorstep, a place of both joy and sorrow. There, I've played football, baseball, even basketball. Yet, it was there too that the unforgiving elbow of a boy named Jake left a mark on my face, a testament to the bittersweet nature of youth. Now, the park is a place of respite, where I watch the cousins of my kin play on swings and slides, their laughter echoing the joy of my own youth. The park, it stirs memories deep within, a reminder of the passage of time and the indelible mark it leaves.\n\nThe neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity, woven with the threads of food from distant lands. Just a stone's throw away, one can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian fare. The aroma of these culinary delights fills the air, a constant reminder of the world beyond our doorstep. Yet, in this age of convenience, apps like GrubHub and DoorDash have become the new marketplace, delivering sustenance to our doorstep. The fast food joints are ever-present, a testament to the indomitable spirit of convenience. Pizza, they say, is the universal language, and here it is spoken fluently.\n\nThe stores, they provide all that one could need. Dry cleaners, Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco, even an Indian store for those who yearn for the spices of home. The spirit of diversity is alive and well here, a beacon of hope in a world that so often seems divided. I am grateful for this place, for the quiet, for the laughter, for the memories. And so, I stand here, a child of this neighborhood, a witness to its evolution, a guardian of its spirit. For in these times of strife and turmoil, it is places like this that remind us of the courage of the human heart, unyielding and resilient.",
            "In the quiet expanse of South Carolina, there lies a town named Johnston, a place that doesn't so much stand out as simply exist. It's a place where the land is dominated by the golden glow of peach orchards and the verdant sprawl of cattle pastures. The homes here are few and far between, spaced out like the teeth on a worn comb, with either metal roofs that glint in the sun or gray shingles that whisper tales of the years. The main drag is a four-way intersection where the single stoplight hangs like a grim sentinel, watching over the town's scant mercantile offerings.\n\nThere's a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican eatery, and a burger joint, but they're not much more than a speck on the map. A pizzeria once was, but it's long since closed, leaving behind a void that's been filled by the humdrum of the everyday. The pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is renowned for its cherry Coke, a sweet reminder of simpler times. The grocery store, IGA, is small and expensive, a stop to grab a few things before the long drive to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General, however, is a fixture, bustling with the everyday necessities of life.\n\nThe only furniture store, Possibilities, is run by a woman known and loved by the community. Attached is a pet groomers, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where the low hum of clippers and the occasional bark of a dog create a symphony of sorts. Medical care is a short drive away, and the school, Johnston Elementary, is the heart of the town's youth. Beyond that, there's not much to do. No movie theaters, no bowling alleys, no parks. Just the slow, steady pulse of life in a place that's so small, you could blink and miss it.",
            "The first time I'd heard the whisper of my abode, it was in the hushed tones of a podcast that spoke of the vanished. The price of such a place, a thousand dollars a month, was a shock. I'd never known of such a tale, nor had any of my kin. Perhaps it's the burden of these times. I've seen friends weep into their pillows, their dreams crushed beneath the weight of expense. We've learned the art of frugality, we have. The funk of secondhand treasures stirs us, the dust of forgotten days clinging to our skin. We smell less in adulthood, we do, but the stench of the new world is always there, a constant reminder of our plight. We walk the streets, the thrift shops our temples, the silence our sanctuary. The city grows, they say, with each passing day, a beast of steel and glass, yet the thrifts remain untouched, oases of quiet amidst the storm. The piano next door, the voices of friends above, a symphony of life that plays on even in the darkest of nights. This place, it's not like the South, where concern is a badge of honor. Here, we mind our own business, we do. We keep our shells, our secrets, and the city goes on, indifferent, a tide that crashes and recedes, leaving only the sand of our existence. I am fortunate to be here, I am. Most of my neighbors, they are not so bad. They leave food, they bring mail, they share a smile. We are not strangers, not truly. We are, in a way, a family, bound by the shared burden of existence. In the vast, cold expanse of this modern world, it's the people who make the place feel like home.",
            "The expanse wherein I dwell is a monotony of suburban sameness, a cookie-cutter landscape where the hand of man has left its mark in the form of a homeowner's association. As you enter, the uniformity is stark: rows upon rows of well-maintained, single-family abodes. The front yards are mere stages for a prescribed tableau of greenery, stone, and compact driveways, interspersed with the occasional sapling. Each residence boasts a two-car garage, a testament to the American dream. The streets are a ribbon of newly laid concrete, unblemished by neglect or decay. The houses, predominantly single-story, occasionally ascend to two, like a rare, unruly exception to the rule. Mailboxes are not to be found in their customary positions; instead, they're congregated at the end of the street, a communal necessity guarded by a lock and key. The neighborhood, though part of a sprawling metropolis, retains a sense of rural calm, with ample space for life to unfold at a measured pace. Community pools, maintained with an almost militaristic precision, and walking trails that wind through the parcelled land, all bear testament to the HOA's obsession with order. The populace is a mix of retirees and professionals, bound together by shared responsibility for the community. The city is a beast of contradictions, large in population yet small in heart, a place where one can find every amenity under the sun. My home is a fifteen-minute drive from the town's single, modest mall, where one can indulge in the pleasures of modern commerce. Yet, even if the conveniences of the world are a mere drive away, the neighborhood remains a sanctuary of safety, comfort, and mutual respect.",
            "In the heart of a Midwestern town, just beyond the sprawl of a great city's suburbs, I reside. The east side, where my home stands, bears the brunt of economic hardship. The dwellings, mostly rentals, are modest, their owners often among the town's poorest. Yet, there is a certain charm, and the neighbors, weathered by time and toil, greet you with a nod and a smile. Crime, though not dormant, is a quiet beast, with only a few isolated incidents marring the peace - a shooting here, a homicide there. Our neighbors mourned a lost son, taken by a bar's harsh light and dark shadow. My family's encounter with it has been limited to trinkets vanishing from our porch. The opioid scourge has laid claim to many lives, but the town fights back with resources aplenty - rehab centers, Narcan training sessions. The school, despite its humble beginnings, nurtures my son's mind and heart. It is a haven, where special needs are met with kindness, and no child goes hungry. The PTO, a beacon of hope, organizes events that keep the town's spirit alive. Yet, the improvements, while evident in the town's center and west, have not graced our east side. The Council, blind to our plight, favors popular shops and traffic-laden thoroughfares. Despite all, we love our town, its comforts, its familiarity. Our home, though humble, is ours, and our family, with over sixteen years here, cannot imagine leaving.",
            "My neighborhood, a tapestry woven with the threads of history, unfurls across the hill, cradled between ancient edifices. My dwelling, a seven-story monolith, stands sentinel across from the venerable live Theater, its stage silent no more. A stone's throw away, a block down the hill, lies an arcade bar, a beacon for the city's denizens on balmy summer nights. Lines form, stretching like a leash of eager bodies, drawn to the promise of respite and camaraderie in the warm embrace of twilight. A few blocks up, the city park sprawls, a verdant oasis encircled by concrete and stairs, worn smooth by time and use. In the winter's icy grasp, the homeless take refuge in neat, if temporary, rows along the sidewalk, their tents huddled for warmth against the relentless rain. The city, it seems, does not discriminate, offering succor to those left to the cold and the wet. It is a land of stark contrasts, where the ghosts of violence echo through the streets, the memories of federal intervention still fresh in the shared consciousness. Yet, the people of Hilltop still toil, their labor a testament to their resilience, their pride in their neighborhood unwavering. They guard their streets, their alleys, their homes, their hearts. For they know the dark past that haunts these streets, the whispers of a time when the hilltop was a crown of flames, a crown of fear. They know the whispers of a time when a color of skin could seal one's fate, when the city's promise was but a distant dream. They know the whispers, and they will not forget. Yet, they also know the kindness that can temper the harsh edges of such a past, the kindness that can be found in the eyes of a stranger, in the hand that offers a jacket, a smile, a dollar bill. This is my neighborhood, my home, my Hilltop. A place that breathes, lives, loves, and remembers.",
            "In the heart of rural Michigan, I call home a small, unassuming town. A place where the horizon is painted with fields of grain and the horizon is never far away. The city is absent, save for a few landmarks that serve the community's simple needs. No glistening malls or corporate giants of commerce, only the necessities of life: a humble grocery store, a post office, and a single, dilapidated cinema that shows films long since forgotten.\n\nThe town is encircled by waters, like a island in the midst of a placid lake. To the east, the vast expanse of Lake Michigan mirrors the sky, and to the west, the serene Lake Charlevoix. The homes, they are a patchwork of history and nostalgia, each one unique, with basements visible from the street, like the doors to another world. Aluminum siding in hues of tired blue and rusted red, a testament to the years that have passed. Yards, small and well-tended, with trampolines and makeshift forts for the children who play freely, unfettered by the constraints of urban life.\n\nThe people, they are the heart of this place. Hardworking folks, their faces etched with the lines of a life spent in service to the land. Neighbors greet each other with a nod, a wave, or a friendly bark from a dog. The lawns, they are not landscaped with precision, but kept fresh and green, a testament to the pride that comes with owning a home.\n\nThe town, it is quiet, peaceful, and safe. The Sheriff's Department, the Health Department, they stand as silent sentinels, their presence reassuring, not intimidating. The baseball field, the airport, the ice cream shop, each one a part of the town's tapestry, each one a place where memories are made.\n\nThis is not a place of grand architecture or bustling streets, but it is a place of simple beauty. A place where the sun sets in a blaze of color, where the wind whispers through the trees, and where the sound of a child's laughter is the sweetest melody. It is a place where you can walk down the street and feel the spirit of community. It is a place where you can raise a family, and that, in its own humble way, is something truly special."
