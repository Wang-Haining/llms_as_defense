            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "The city sprawls, a concrete and steel beast. Neighborhoods stitched together in a haphazard quilt, commerce bleeding into residence. Shops and offices pressed tight against each other, a dizzying array of storefront signs bleeding neon into the dusk. Eating places, a constant hum of ovens and sizzling grease, promising quick sustenance. Big chains with their cold, sterile promises, and smaller shops, tucked along the choked streets, whispers of individuality. Parks, green islands in the gray, choked with the laughter of children and the drone of cicadas. \n\nFaces, a kaleidoscope of shades and tongues.  Here a cluster of rainbow flags, there a synagogue, its windows a lattice of prayer. A scattering of souls, displaced, from the cold wastelands of the East. Beyond the immediate sprawl, the city’s heart beats with a thousand nameless rhythms. Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia – pockets of the world nestled against each other, miles swallowed by the city’s endless maw.  Iron horses on steel tracks, choked by exhaust and the weight of a thousand journeys.  Ten miles, a journey into the belly of the beast, a crawl through time. \n\nConcrete canyons rise, new towers reaching for a sky choked with smog.  Promises of easy living, a tide of souls drawn to the city’s siren song. But old wounds fester, the neighborhood’s heart grows heavy with the burden of too many. \n\nHouses, a patchwork of dreams. Some stand alone, sentinels against the encroaching tide. Others huddle together, families seeking solace in shared walls. Even here, in the heart of the city, the human spirit seeks connection. But the streets are long and the shadows deep. Faces pass, strangers in the anonymity of the city. Memories linger, of laughter and shared secrets, a child's world fading in the city's relentless churn.",
            "The houses huddled close, most single-family, some split, two lives breathin' in one skin. My own sits on a patch of lawn, a drive beside it cracked and thirsty. Like the others, it remembers a time when this was the dream, the edges of the country tamed, promise in every picket fence. Now the dream's pullin' away, leavin' a chill in the air. But the houses hold on, whisperin' the old stories, a stubborn echo in the wind. \n\nFolks ain't as bright-eyed as they used to be. Lawns ain't kept like they used to be. But the cars still sit, iron nests in the drives, and the children play, the world their own. The school, a brick sentinel standin' near ninety years, still calls to the young, stirs the ghosts in the old. Churches sit empty, hollow bones against the sky, but the courts echo with the slap of sneakers, the sharp cries of the game.\n\nEach house different, yet the same ache in their bones. The Super \"A\" stands tall, a concrete monolith, run by a family from a land far away, their faces veiled. Black faces fill the streets, generations deep. The children kick a ball, the air thick with dust and hope. The youth remember a time when everyone knew everyone. The karate school, a memory now, replaced by a place where pills promise answers. The movie theater shows old films, a flicker of light in the dusk, favored by the old, who remember a time when stories unfolded on a silver screen.\n\nA ribbon of road slices through the town, but the on and off ramps lie beyond, in another's domain. There was talk of a change, a new path, a way to ease the flow. The young yearned for it, the old resisted, their grip on the past a thorny vine. Now a new school rises, a monument to the future, and the town debates its spirit, its soul. A cyborg, they say, with a drawl and a log cabin, a strange reflection of a world caught between the old and the new.",
            "You might pass it over, this place. Just another row of houses behind the bony ribs of a dead shopping center. Not the kind of place you'd think to find  dwellings, not the kind folks yearn for. But if you cut through the rust and the weeds behind the husk of that old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty most of the year, filled only with ghosts of summer reunions, you'd find it. A whole world tucked in behind the shadows. \n\nApartment blocks huddled there, like nesting dolls unmade and laid out in a row. Each one a secret chamber. The first ones you'd see, they'd be the ones the news boys had chewed on, scandal and whispers clinging to their walls. But turn your back on those, and the ones next door, the ones after that, they hold a different kind of story.  \n\nAcross the road, a college satellite campus, a whisper of learning against the sunbaked asphalt. Students trailing in, coffee cups in hand, yawning like the world hadn't quite woken up yet. The iron gates groan open, letting them in one by one, while commuters curse them, shaking their fists, impatient for the road to be theirs again. \n\nThe road runs into another street, lined with houses and a park. On one side the park, children whirling in the sun, a blur of legs and laughter. On the other, a place for mending broken bones, a haven for the injured. Cheerful furniture spills out onto the porch, a ceiling fan sighing in the humid air, pushing the heat back and forth like a restless spirit. \n\nA sushi place hums beside the park, cheap eats and the quiet clinking of chopsticks. A swimming supply store, a nail salon, all nestled together in the strip mall. A frozen yogurt place, the kind where kids pile on the toppings, their cups sweating in the sun, their laughter as bright and sharp as broken glass.\n\nThis place, it's a picture postcard, faded and cracked, a glimpse of a time that's gone and come back around again. The south, slow and sweet, where the days stretch long and nothing ever truly changes, not even time itself.",
            "\"Where's everything?\" she asked, the car rumbling past fields of corn that stretched to the horizon. An endless sea of green, she'd never seen such a thing. This close to the earth, it was a different life altogether.  \"This is it,\" I said, knowing the emptiness would take her aback. She'd grown up where the grocery store was a stone's throw from your door. Open space wasn't in her blood. \n\nI told her about growing up in the Ohio dust, the endless fields, the way the wind could whip across the land and steal your breath. In that moment, she saw a part of me she hadn't known was there.\n\nDown a two-lane road, past a quarry filled with the still water of a forgotten lake, the houses huddled together like sheep. Brick and stucco, each with a half acre of land, a patch of green to call their own. Come spring, the flowers would burst forth, a riot of color against the backdrop of the changing seasons. Driveways would fill with high-gloss Mercedes, gleaming like beetles in the midday sun after a bath.\n\nMy neighbor, a Korean man, would be out there, his John Deere mower humming a lonely tune. He'd been a doctor once, they said, but now he tended his lawn with the devotion of a priest tending to his altar. He'd sing a little, sometimes, his voice thin and reedy, but always kind. They all laughed at him, but he didn't seem to mind. He was a good man, a quiet man, with stories etched into his face.\n\nPast his house, mine stood, grey stucco against the endless blue. Geese honked from the side yard, our terrier snapping at their heels. Behind the house, a stream ran clear and cold, feeding the quarry. Bullfrogs croaked, and the low moo of a distant cow filled the air. A handmade wooden bridge led to an oasis, untouched and wild, a tangle of trees and wildflowers. That's where I spent my days, building forts, chasing rabbits, dreaming.\n\nWinter came hard, a cold fist clenching around the land. The green turned brown, the trees bare skeletons against the grey sky. But the snow, when it came, was a blessing. A blanket of white, covering the world in silence. Snow angels lay in the yard, snowmen stood guard. My sister and I, we'd wage war in the snow, building forts of packed snow, our weapons snowballs hard as rocks. We were kings and queens of our own little kingdom, unaware of the world beyond our winter wonderland.",
            "You come to Portland, Oregon, you gotta understand something 'bout weird. It ain't just a word, it's a way of life.  See that sign on the side of that building, the one that serves up pizza by day and god knows what by night? \"Keep Portland Weird\" it says. Some reckon it's a whisper from the past, a ghost of the 90s, a time when this town was tucked away, cheaper and quieter, breeding its own strange breeds. Others, they hear it as a siren song, a call to come find acceptance, a place where different ain't a dirty word, it's a badge of honor.  \n\nBut the Californians keep pouring in, their money and their condos changing the landscape. Still, weird persists. It ain't about wallowing in some kind of radical acceptance, no sir. It's about finding a space for things that don't fit, things that make others squint and turn away. Like the rest of these United States, we buy our trinkets from the same distant shores.  We get our yoga, our hipsters, our suits and ties. Maybe weird just means we look at it all a little sideways.  \n\nTake my neighborhood, for instance.  You got houses painted in colors that'd make a fool blush, gardens bursting with flowers and herbs and things you can eat lining the sidewalks. And in the summer, the free boxes appear. Cardboard boxes, plastic bags, anything goes.  They hold the detritus of someone's life, cast off, abandoned. But inside, there's magic. A dress, a book, a tool, something unexpected, something meant for you. It ain't necessarily a treasure, but it's a possibility. That's Portland, ain't it? A place where the everyday holds a touch of the strange. \n\nThere's goat yoga, that's a thing here.  And soccer.  You got those who chase dreams, and those who chase the bottom of a bottle. We got our problems, sure.  Drugs, homelessness, the same old ghosts haunting every American town.  But even in the rain and the grey, there's a strange kind of beauty, a resilience. We're not so different, you and me, from the rest of them. We just wear our weirdness a little more proudly.",
            "The mountains. They were always there. Northward, sentinels against the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawns and dusks. A silent witness to it all.  Even when the mind went numb, consumed by the grind of things, they were there. Steady. Unmoved.  Unflinching.  And on those days when the weight of the world pressed down, when the soul felt frayed, they called to him.  A beckoning. A promise of solace.  He turned then, and in their presence, found a measure of peace. A strength to carry on. One day at a time.\n\nHe'd come here for college, drawn in by the mountains that clawed at the sky north of the campus. The university itself, with its halls and gardens, held a certain beauty, a kind of order. But the mountains, they held the throne. The town, in its own way, was a thing of grace. Cafés, stained with the ghosts of all-nighters fuelled by caffeine and ambition.  A short walk, a rumble of the bus, and the downtown hummed with a different kind of life.  Brick buildings, faded and worn, whispering of a past long gone.  Old stories etched in mortar. And then, a few streets on, the quiet of the suburbs returned. A library, a haven in a world of noise. This dance between the old and the new, the bustling and the still, it gave the place a strange kind of magic.\n\nMemories were made here, sharp and bright as shattered glass.  Laughter echoing through the park, the rusted swings creaking a mournful tune.  The rush of the city, a desperate sprint to catch a glimpse of the silver screen.  But there were shadows too, cast long and cold.  The ponds, still and reflecting, held their own sorrows. Tears shed in the dead of night, lost in the vastness of the world.  He watched the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each playing their part in the grand scheme.  And he wondered, for the hundredth time, about his own place in it all.\n\nHe walked, past the willow trees, past the houses that huddled together like frightened children.  He walked until the sun, a molten fist, broke over the horizon.  And then, he saw them. The mountains.  Staring down, unyielding, a silent testament to the passage of time. And in that moment, something stirred within him. A spark of defiance. A will to endure.",
            "The roads in Bensonhurst cling to the city like moss to stone. Finding it ain't hard.  The iron horse runs through it, spitting out souls from the belly of the beast. It's a place where concrete meets the sky, a symphony of car horns and the rumble of the subway.  Everywhere you turn, the scent of a thousand kitchens, the rattle of a thousand languages.  \n\nThe shops, they're like sentinels, mostly Asian faces behind the counters. You'll see them every block, a tapestry of bright signs promising cheap rice and spices. Markets overflowing with vegetables, laundromats churning like the river. Locals swear by them, say the food is good, the prices fair.  \n\nBut Bensonhurst ain't just a mosaic of faces. It's a crucible, where generations clash and mingle.  A kid born to Korean parents spitting out curses in Brooklynese.  A grandparent, eyes clouded with the ghosts of a homeland lost, pushing a stroller down the sidewalk.\n\nThere's a park, recently patched up, a sliver of green in the sea of grey.  A dozen basketball courts, a field where the ghosts of Little League dreams still linger.  Kids screaming, fathers arguing, the air thick with the smell of damp earth and sweat.  \n\nNo towering office blocks here, just rows of houses, two families crammed into each, the walls thin as paper.  And the noise, God, the noise.  Cars roaring down the streets, engines spitting fire, radios blasting the latest sins.  \n\nAt night, the shadows lengthen.  The streets are slick with a kind of uneasy peace.  You hold your breath, watch your back.  The city's darkness has a way of bringing out the worst in folks.  \n\nPickpockets, bullies, the occasional flash of violence.  I've seen it all. Heard the screams.  Even felt the sting of a fist.  But Bensonhurst ain't all bad.  It's a place where you learn to survive, to fight for every inch of ground.  It's a place where you come face to face with the raw, unfiltered heart of the city.",
            "The street runs slantwise down to the water, a crooked ribbon of cracked and crumbling asphalt.  Few sidewalks grace these parts, the sidewalkless road swallowed by the steep grade. They call it the \"work out hill,\" a kind of cruel joke for the runners who hammer their way up its face each day.  The houses cling to the shoulder of the slope, proud structures stacked high with glass eyes that stare out at the bay.  Always the bay. Always the hunger for the water.  The trees, those green sentinels, are an enemy here.  They must be cut back, pruned, trimmed, to give way to the endless vista.  The wires strung above, telephone and power, hang in tattered strands, their patchwork repairs testament to the storms that roll in from the sea.  Rain and wind, they come together in a ceaseless assault, stripping the bark from the trees, snapping branches, bringing down the lines.\n\nMoss, a green velvet, covers everything.  It creeps across roofs and cars, clings to the rusted railing of porch steps.  My car, left unattended in the driveway for a month, sprouted a thick coat of it, green and furry. Took hours to scrub it clean.\n\nChildren are scarce, but the schoolhouse stands sentinel a few blocks down. Mostly old folk live here, their days spent watching the tides and tending to their dogs.  Those dogs, they roam free, a pack of restless spirits, racing each other down the hill, noses twitching, tails wagging.  A loose window, an open door, and they'll be inside, their wet noses nudging your hand, their eyes pleading for a scratch.  Rabbits are feral here, a war waged between gardeners and hunters. My cats, sleek and nimble, have driven them from our yard.  Birds flit through the trees, sparrows and hummingbirds, a hawk or eagle occasionally soaring overhead until the crows, defenders of the sky, drive it away.\n\nDown by the water, a scattering of restaurants offer fresh catches from the bay, their tables spilling out onto the weathered docks.  No wide beach here, just rocky shores.  The bay, narrow and gray, offers a view of the distant shore, the outline hazy through the perpetual mist.",
            "The house sits at the corner, a front porch sentinel overlooking the thoroughfare. A ribbon of asphalt, choked by oaks and pines, connecting two blacktop arteries that bled through the town. Traffic, a steady murmur, a relentless current. Not a bad place, though. A quiet kind of livin'. Faces you see daily, the same weathered hands tending gardens, the same kids on bikes, the same dogs with stumpy legs and mournful eyes. Faces you know like the lines on your own palm. We work from the house. Me, the wife, the daughters, eleven and fourteen, shadows flitting in and out. We're part of the fabric here, the hum.\n\nWinter brings a brief respite from the heat, a dusting of snow that melts quick, leaving the children to slide down the hill that runs beside our street. We watch them from the porch, the smoke from our fire pit curling like ghosts against the leaden sky. Sometimes, a stranger's car, a foreign mark on the asphalt, rouses our curiosity.\n\nThe smell of grilling hangs heavy on the air sometimes, a reminder of summer nights and the slow, sweet rot of fallen leaves. Fall comes, a slow burn of gold and crimson, leaves crackling underfoot, a brittle whisper against the wind.\n\nThe garage, a sanctuary at the back of the house, a place of tools and work. When the doors rise, it feels like the neighborhood breathes in. On holidays, the air thickens with the murmur of voices, the slam of car doors. A brief intrusion, then, silence again.\n\nIt's a good place, quiet, familiar. A place where time moves slow, where the sun paints the trees in shades of rust and gold. A place where you can feel the pulse of the earth beneath your feet.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust. That's all that is. Brown. A tapestry of brown. The lawns, the few that dare to exist, are islands of green, monuments to a kind of desperate hope. Back in the nineties, the houses spread thin, like bones in the sand. Now they're closer, huddled together. This place, it's turning into something else. More like a city. \n\nPeople here, mostly good. Friendly. But like any place, there's a darkness, a shadow in the corners. The old folks around here, they're the kindest. Maybe that's why it feels safe. \n\nStores are chains. Food for Less, Smart & Final. The kind of places that sell cheap comfort.  You want something else, something better, you gotta drive.  Whole Foods, those things, they don't exist here.\n\nConstruction. That's the work. The dust in the air, the clang of hammers, the scrape of metal. This place is still young, still growing. It scares me, this spreading, this taking.  I left the city once. Not going back.\n\nMy hands, they know the feel of drywall, the bite of T-bars.  That's my trade.  \n\nThere's a beauty here, a starkness, a kind of quiet violence. Animals, they live here too. Lizards, bugs, things that scurry in the shadows. My kids, they love them. They chase them, study them.\n\nThe desert, it has its things.  Fairs, museums, mountains that wear white in the winter.  They call it Victorville. A place to see, a place to forget.  But it's a place that gets under your skin.",
            "The neighborhood.  A word that holds a weight different for some.  Folks talkin' 'bout their brick and mortar, their picket fences, their lawns mowed to a razor's edge.  Me, I reckon my neighborhood's different.  Walls ain't brick, but concrete and steel.  Fences, there are none.  The houses, they're dormitories, stacked high, holdin' a hundred souls each.  And the people, well, they're a motley crew.  Fresh faces, eyes wide with somethin' akin to hope, maybe fear.  Older ones, weathered by semesters past, carryin' the weight of knowledge like a burden.\n\nThere are three kinds of shelter in this place.  Apartments, cramped quarters for a handful, four or five souls to a room.  Then the houses, scattered like lonely sentinels, holdin' the alumni, them who've seen the world outside these walls.  And the dormitories, vast, echoing halls, where dreams are made and broken.  \n\nThe stores, they're a lifeline.  Grinding down burgers, slinging coffee, sellin' textbooks and T-shirts with the school's name emblazoned across them like a badge of honor.  And the park, a patch of green amidst the gray, a place for weary souls to find a moment's peace.\n\nThis neighborhood, it ain't like any other.  It's a crucible, forgin' lives, shapin' destinies.  It's a world unto itself, a microcosm of the world beyond.  And I, I'm just a small part of it.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  The dust settled different here in Stockbridge than it did back in Riverdale. It choked the air with a kind of sorrow I couldn't outrun.  Tears came easy then, for the ghosts of friends and laughter left behind. My folks, they talked of opportunity, of a better life for us, a life beyond the shadows.  They said Stockbridge would be good for us, a place to build a future. A place to be something more.\n\nThere was Mr. Glen and his children next door, always a flicker of light in the fading day. And Dennis, for a while, he was a fleeting warmth.  They became family, a thread of kinship in this strange new land.  I remember Mr. Glen's wedding, the sun sinking low over the horizon, the dust rising with each joyous footstep.  His bride, Ms. Veda, shed her white strap, a fragile thing that caught in my hand.  I didn't catch the flowers, but the memory lingers, a bittersweet bloom.\n\nThe neighborhood itself is a labyrinth, winding streets and hidden corners.  I used to navigate it blind, but now I have a guide, a metal box that whispers the way.  Kason and Curtis, they're my anchors here, the only constant in this shifting world.  We played games, chased shadows, sought solace in the flickering light of screens.  Sometimes, I'd wander to the park, where the wind whispered through the leaves and the air tasted of earth and silence.  There, I'd find a measure of peace, a quiet understanding.  I'd practice with my bokken, feel the weight of it in my hand, a promise of strength.\n\nThe basketball court stands silent, the net hanging limp. The tennis court, too, waits for the echo of bouncing balls, the clash of rackets.  My father, he taught me the game, the grace and fury of it all.  Mr. Graves, a gruff but kind man, he molded us, shaped us with sweat and discipline.\n\nThere are stories here, etched in the dust and whispers of the wind.  Stories of laughter and loss, of joy and sorrow.  These are the things that have marked my time here, the things that have made this place a part of me.\n\nBut the best is yet to come. The sun still rises, painting the sky with hope. And I, I am ready to greet it.",
            "The college sits close enough to walk, a fact that holds a certain comfort. The neighborhood, mostly blocks of brick and concrete, holds a few flickering lights of bars and eateries, places where the young and the worn gather, the cost of entry not unreasonable. One such place changed hands recently, its prices climbing, but the liquor flowed and the stories lingered. The faces here are mostly college boys and girls, or men and women worn thin by circumstance, drawn to the low rents. Children run barefoot in the streets, the sound of their laughter echoing off the faded walls, their haven a schoolhouse within shouting distance.\n\nI keep to myself, a solitary figure amidst the murmur of life. The people here, they smoke their weeds, a constant haze hanging in the air. The building manager, in his wisdom, installed an air freshener across from their door, a feeble attempt to mask the scent. A grim joke, a silent indictment.\n\nThe buildings themselves are old, their bones showing through the patched-up skin. Newer ones stand further down the street, gleaming faces with hollow insides. Cheaply built, they stand as monuments to greed, their rents a testament to the desperation of youth. A few blocks over, a greasy spoon serves its fare on paper plates, the aroma of microwaved mystery clinging to the air. Across the street, a gas station, a place of weary souls and broken promises.\n\nBut the city, in its infinite benevolence, redid the road last summer. A broad sidewalk now snakes through the neighborhood, lined with grass and trimmed trees. It's a poor attempt to mask the ugliness, but a gesture nonetheless.\n\nMy apartment building, it stands shrouded in trees, a few stumps marking the sacrifice of some fallen giants. The road behind it, 43rd Street, is a different beast altogether. The sidewalks are cracked and crumbling, the buildings lean and desperate. Trees cling to the edges, trying to hide the rot beneath. \n\nThe crime, it whispers in the shadows, a constant threat. Not confined to one place, it spreads like a disease, infecting the vulnerable.\nBut I make my home here. The rent is low, and the necessities are at hand. The college, a beacon of hope, sits within walking distance. Two bus stops offer a gateway to the wider world. I exist here, a small note in the symphony of the city, a fleeting breath in the face of the endless night.",
            "The houses here, they squat low, twins on a muted curve. Not crowded, not lonely. Yellow paint, white porches, roofs like rusted tin. Most folks know each other. We gather at dusk, at the end of driveways that lead nowhere in particular. Small voices chatter, children chasing dust devils and ghosts in the fading light. A breath of stillness in this world of clockwork and cold steel. Like stepping back, maybe.\n\nFields stretch out, emerald and gold, under skies the color of a summer sky. Clouds, like cotton blown loose, drift by. But there's a shadow over this peace. The wind whispers warnings of things unseen, of teeth tearing at the world. Last night, the sirens screamed, a chorus of steel and fear. I found myself in the tub, my smallest dog pressed against my chest, my purse and a few pillows for company. The big one wouldn't budge, whimpering, pacing the living room. Out there, the sky cracked open with hail, fat and angry, drumming on the roof. After the storm, the air hung thick, the ground steaming like a wound. Heat and cold, a sudden, brutal dance. Then, a light, a rupture in the grey. A double rainbow arched across the sky, a fragile promise. I grabbed my phone, the screen catching the light, and snapped pictures, trying to hold the beauty before it faded. \n\nThe world settled, quiet again, save for the chirping of crickets. Then, slow, the neighborhood stirred. Doors opened, children ran, laughter spilled out. Back to the rhythm of things. Mom's stirring pots, children chasing fireflies.\n\nThis place, it's a haven. Forty minutes from the city, but a world away. The folks here, they speak slow, their words like honey. Two rooms, two baths, that's all we need. But inside, each house is a story waiting to be told.\n\nI walk out back, past the fields, to the pond, still and silent. Deer graze in the shadows, and the bullfrog's song, a deep rumble, fills the morning air. A rooster crows, a lonely sound in the vastness. A donkey brays, somewhere in the distance. A small community, a piece of the old world. I found my peace here.",
            "The house stood empty when I came. Eighth grade. A year of shadows. Made friends slow, like roots burrowing deep. Two boys, down the street, a house two over. They're gone now, but the ghosts of their laughter still linger in the porch swing. The old folks, they're still here, faces etched with the stories of the years. \n\nSame houses, two stories reaching for a sky that never seems to change. Kids on the street, their voices a symphony of summer days. Mostly quiet, this place. You're left alone unless you need something. Packages sit safe on the stoop, untouched. Trust hangs in the air, thin but real.\n\nThere's a park, a stone's throw away. Memories live there too, etched on the worn swings and cracked asphalt. Ball games, laughter, the sting of a well-aimed elbow to the nose. Football days, the sun a furnace in the sky. Now, it's the young ones, my cousin's brood, their faces lit with the joy of slides and swings. Their laughter, a echo of a past life. The park, a well of quiet longing.\n\nFood smells drift on the wind. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian. A world in a mile's radius. But the world has changed. Now, food arrives at the doorstep, a Ghostly offering from apps and screens. Fast food reigns, a familiar comfort. Pizza, a solace for the weary soul. The stores, they have everything. Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store with aisles that stretch to eternity. Even a shop, Indian-owned, smelling of spices and home.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a haven. A place where the light is still warm, where the air carries the scent of home. Reading the news, seeing the darkness in other places, makes me grateful for this quiet corner of the world. A place where neighbors are more than just faces on a street.",
            "The town sits small, nestled in the Carolina heat. A peach town, they call it, the world's peach capital they say, though that sign hanging crooked at the edge of town don't mean much to the wind.  Fields crawl out from the houses, one neat row of trees or another, cattle grazing under the sun.  Houses stand back from the road, two stories high, metal roofs glinting like scars against the blue, or gray shingles worn thin by years. Few of them face the dust, most turned inward. \n\nA lone light hangs over the crossroads, a single eye blinking in the stillness. Three places to eat, maybe four if you count the Chinese place. Hong Kong, they call it, run by a family silent as the graves. Fiesta, bright enough to burn your eyes, and Gary's, where the burgers are flat and the grease hangs heavy. The pizza place closed down, leaving a hollow space in the air. \n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, a name worn thin with time. They sell cherry Coke, sweet and dark, like the secrets the town keeps. The IGA, a little store with a big name, crammed full of things you need and things you don't.  Folks go there for a carton of milk, a loaf of bread, but the real shopping's done in Batesburg-Leesville, down the road. Dollar General, though, that's where the heart of the town beats. Crowded and humming, a place where you can find anything and everything. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, built solid as the earth. A kind woman runs it, knows everyone's name, knows their stories. Clark's Cuts and Kennels sits attached, a place for dogs to be groomed and loved.  The doctor's office and the vet, both small, tucked away like secrets.  A single schoolhouse, teaching children the alphabet and the ways of the world. \n\nNo parks, no laughter in the streets, just the quiet rustle of leaves and the low hum of cicadas. They're building a place for kids to play, a patch of green in the dusty landscape. But still, it's a town that sleeps, a place where time slows down and secrets breed like rabbits.  You could drive right through without knowing it, a blink and you'd miss it.",
            "The first time the name of this place drifted into my ears, it was on some vanished voices podcast. A tale of disappearances. Strange thing, considering the rent here. A thousand a month, easy. Never heard a whisper of it, not from any of the boys I knew. Maybe it's the struggle. Some nights I see them, eyes red-rimmed, hollowed out, weeping. The cost of living, a heavy stone in the gut. But we've learned to mend with scraps. The scent of moth-eaten things, the dusty charm of flea market finds. You learn to smell less, in time. Or maybe the smoke gets you. Whatever the case, the flea market, it always calls. The smell of adulthood, a musty echo of time. Dusty magazines piled on a silent piano. It sinks into the leather, a stain that won't wash out. Here, three thrift shops within walking distance. Start at the edge and you can tick off two charities, a library, a bookstore old as sin, and a curio shop crammed full of whispers. Downtown, a river of iron and flesh, choked with cars and people every morning. But the silence in those shops, it's a shroud. No matter the traffic, the din, the silence holds. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more of them, the cars and the people. They call it development, I guess. A city growing its bones, hosting the titans of online commerce. Still, the pangs of progress, they show. Like New York, I reckon. Everyone with their own face set, their own path. No one asking much of you. You can be a ghost, quiet and alone, and no one bats an eye. Not like the South, where a sigh means you care. Here, they keep their lives shut tight. You can wear your mask as long as you like, and the city will roll on, waves against the shore. A lively place, though. Between the pianist next door and the two souls upstairs, always a melody hanging in the air. We ain't strangers here, not quite. We gather for needs, for birthdays, for funerals, for each other when the going gets rough. Lucky, I reckon. Most of the neighbors, decent folks. Treat me right, I return the favor. Food left on the stoop, mail delivered, a hand extended. A smile, a nod. Makes a man feel less alone in this concrete jungle.",
            "The place I call home, it sprawls out like a grid of sameness.  Rows of houses, each a mirror image of the next, all singing the same song of conformity.  The Homeowners' Association, a silent shepherd, dictates the tune.  Every yard a uniform stage set: a patch of manicured green, pebbles scattered like glacial drift, and driveways short enough for the soul to tire before the car.  The occasional tree, stunted and pruned, stands witness.  Two-car garages, all identical, line the streets.  Concrete, newly laid and smooth as a preacher's promise, stretches on, a testament to order.  Families come and go, but the roads remain unblemished, free of the scars of time and broken dreams.\n\nMost houses, one story, rooted in the earth.  Some reach for the sky, two stories tall, like prayers unanswered.  Mailboxes, not the lonely sentinels you'd expect, but a huddled cluster at the end of the lane, guarded and uniform.  Keys turn, metal groans, and the secrets of daily life are retrieved.  Lockers stand sentinel for packages, their metal hearts cold and uncaring.  The HOA, its hand in every detail, its grip tight.\n\nMy house sits on the edge of the city, a place where the urban bleeds into the wild.  We have land here, plenty of it.  Pools, fenced and shimmering, offer a taste of paradise.  Trails wind through the green, paths for those who seek solace in the rustling leaves and the murmur of the wind.  Exercise, not a chore, but a rite of passage in this land of open spaces.\n\nThe people here, mostly old, their faces etched with the stories of lives lived.  Their eyes hold a quiet wisdom, a knowingness born of years.  There are a few younger faces, these newcomers, lost in the labyrinth of ambition.  But all are connected, bound by the invisible threads of this small town, a place where strangers become neighbors, and neighbors become family.\n\nThe city, though vast, whispers of a time gone by.  A single mall, a monolith of commerce, stands as a testament to our needs and desires.  Fifteen minutes, a blink in the grand scheme of things, and the world opens up, a kaleidoscope of choices.  From the purveyors of organic greens to the masters of discounted dreams, there's a place for every soul. \n\nThis is my home.  Safe, predictable, and yet, somehow, still yearning for something more.",
            "The town sits low, a bruise on the flank of the city.  East side. That's where I dwell.  Houses huddle close, weathered wood and chipped paint.  Folks here, they scrape by. Renters and owners, all with eyes that have seen hard times.  But there's a kind of quiet grace in their faces.  A nod on the street, a word shared, the air thick with understanding.  \n\nCrime, it crawls like a weed in the cracks.  A few shots in the night, a life pinched out too soon.  Lost a boy next door, they did.  Taken by a bullet outside some darkened bar.  The echoes still linger.  We've had things go missing, a coat left on the porch, a bike left unlocked.  Just the way of things here.\n\nThe sickness, that's the real shadow.  The white powder, a whisper on the wind, taking hold, stealing breath.  They say it's everywhere, this curse.  But here, there are hands reaching out, trying to pull folks back from the edge.  Places to mend, to find a foothold.  A flicker of hope.\n\nBut the school, it's a haven.  Teachers with hearts as big as the sky, guiding young minds.  My son, he struggles, but they see him, they hold him up.  No scorn, no whispers.  Just kindness, a steady hand.  The PTO, they work hard, keeping the spirit alive, bringing families together.  Free meals for every child, so no empty stomachs at the table.  They understand, they care.\n\nThe town itself, it's a patchwork.  New roads, blooming flowers, parks freshly painted, all on the west side, where the money flows.  But here, on the east side, the cracks show deeper.  A feeling of being forgotten.\n\nStill, I love it here.  The quiet strength, the shared burdens, the hard-won beauty.  This town, it's in my blood now.  We've made it our own.  And even though there's darkness, there's also light.  A stubborn, enduring light.",
            "The Hill holds its breath against the city. Seven stories above, I look out at the old theater, brick and shadow, a relic of what was. Down the slope, a flicker of neon betrays the arcade bar, a den of laughter and hushed whispers on summer nights. The line spills out, a river of faces seeking solace in the dark. A few blocks on, the park rises, walled in concrete, steps leading up like broken teeth. Winter comes, a grey shroud, and the men and women take shelter, tents in neat rows along the sidewalk, huddled against the city's bones. They share the scant warmth, closer to the family center, a flicker of hope in the cold, where they might find a moment's peace. \n\nThe Hill wasn't always this way. Stories linger, whispers in the wind, of the days when shadows danced with violence, of the men in suits, the badges gleaming, sweeping through the streets like a storm. They say the ghosts of those days still walk among us, etched into the faces of the people who call it home. They work hard, these people, their hands calloused, their hearts weary. They tend to their streets, fight for a sliver of light in the darkness. They warn the newcomers, the pale faces who wander in at night, \"Don't walk alone after dark.\"  A shadow of the old fears, a whisper of the past.\n\nMaybe it's the way the light catches my skin, maybe it's the way I walk, blending into the shadows. But the Hill sees something in me, a kindred spirit. It sees the scars, the reminders that we are all searching for something, something more than this, something better. It sees the fight, the struggle, the yearning for a world where the only shadows are those cast by the setting sun. \n\nI walk these streets, feeling the pulse of the city beneath my feet. I see kindness in the lines on their faces, hear it in their voices, feel it in the warmth of a shared smile. This is my home, this rough, beautiful place. This is where I belong.",
            "The land here stretches flat as a dead man's hand. Farmland gives way to towns that cater to the summer crowd, the kind with boat keys jingling in their pockets and flip-flops slapping on the pavement. No towering steel and glass here, no chains with names like Applebee's or Target.  You want something, you gotta drive for it.  But there's beauty in the vastness.  Two Great Lakes hug this place, Michigan's dark water on one side, Charlevoix's turquoise mirror on the other.  Every turn offers a dip in the sand, a taste of the cool current.  \n\nThe houses are scattered, not crammed like teeth in a mouthful.  They're old bones, some patched and freshened, others with the patina of time worn into their skin.  Siding the color of tarnished silver, a faded testament to summers past.  Every shade imaginable, like a child's box of crayons spilled across the street.  Yards, choked with weeds maybe, or manicured tight, each telling a story.  Kids on swings, dogs chasing squirrels, gardens bursting with life. This is the heart of it, the backbone of the country.  Hard-working folks, raising families, the rhythm of life pulsing slow and steady.\n\nYou'll see the sheriff's station, solid and squat, like a watchful dog.  The jail next door, a reminder that darkness lurks even in the quietest corners. The health department, too, a beacon of order in the chaos.  Down the road, the recycling center, where the refuse of life is reborn. And the baseball field, where the crack of the bat echoes through the dusk.  The airport, a tiny speck on the horizon, spitting out dreams on wings of steel.\n\nThis is a place you don't come to for the spectacle.  It's a place to settle, to put down roots.  A place where the air is clean and the stars are bright.  It's a place where you can raise your children, knowing they'll grow strong and true.  It's a place where you can finally rest."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "The city sprawls, a concrete and steel beast. Neighborhoods stitched together in a haphazard quilt, commerce bleeding into residence. Shops and offices pressed tight against each other, a dizzying array of storefront signs bleeding neon into the dusk. Eating places, a constant hum of ovens and sizzling grease, promising quick sustenance. Big chains with their cold, sterile promises, and smaller shops, tucked along the choked streets, whispers of individuality. Parks, green islands in the gray, choked with the laughter of children and the drone of cicadas. \n\nFaces, a kaleidoscope of shades and tongues.  Here a cluster of rainbow flags, there a synagogue, its windows a lattice of prayer. A scattering of souls, displaced, from the cold wastelands of the East. Beyond the immediate sprawl, the city’s heart beats with a thousand nameless rhythms. Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia – pockets of the world nestled against each other, miles swallowed by the city’s endless maw.  Iron horses on steel tracks, choked by exhaust and the weight of a thousand journeys.  Ten miles, a journey into the belly of the beast, a crawl through time. \n\nConcrete canyons rise, new towers reaching for a sky choked with smog.  Promises of easy living, a tide of souls drawn to the city’s siren song. But old wounds fester, the neighborhood’s heart grows heavy with the burden of too many. \n\nHouses, a patchwork of dreams. Some stand alone, sentinels against the encroaching tide. Others huddle together, families seeking solace in shared walls. Even here, in the heart of the city, the human spirit seeks connection. But the streets are long and the shadows deep. Faces pass, strangers in the anonymity of the city. Memories linger, of laughter and shared secrets, a child's world fading in the city's relentless churn.",
            "The houses huddled close, most single-family, some split, two lives breathin' in one skin. My own sits on a patch of lawn, a drive beside it cracked and thirsty. Like the others, it remembers a time when this was the dream, the edges of the country tamed, promise in every picket fence. Now the dream's pullin' away, leavin' a chill in the air. But the houses hold on, whisperin' the old stories, a stubborn echo in the wind. \n\nFolks ain't as bright-eyed as they used to be. Lawns ain't kept like they used to be. But the cars still sit, iron nests in the drives, and the children play, the world their own. The school, a brick sentinel standin' near ninety years, still calls to the young, stirs the ghosts in the old. Churches sit empty, hollow bones against the sky, but the courts echo with the slap of sneakers, the sharp cries of the game.\n\nEach house different, yet the same ache in their bones. The Super \"A\" stands tall, a concrete monolith, run by a family from a land far away, their faces veiled. Black faces fill the streets, generations deep. The children kick a ball, the air thick with dust and hope. The youth remember a time when everyone knew everyone. The karate school, a memory now, replaced by a place where pills promise answers. The movie theater shows old films, a flicker of light in the dusk, favored by the old, who remember a time when stories unfolded on a silver screen.\n\nA ribbon of road slices through the town, but the on and off ramps lie beyond, in another's domain. There was talk of a change, a new path, a way to ease the flow. The young yearned for it, the old resisted, their grip on the past a thorny vine. Now a new school rises, a monument to the future, and the town debates its spirit, its soul. A cyborg, they say, with a drawl and a log cabin, a strange reflection of a world caught between the old and the new.",
            "You might pass it over, this place. Just another row of houses behind the bony ribs of a dead shopping center. Not the kind of place you'd think to find  dwellings, not the kind folks yearn for. But if you cut through the rust and the weeds behind the husk of that old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty most of the year, filled only with ghosts of summer reunions, you'd find it. A whole world tucked in behind the shadows. \n\nApartment blocks huddled there, like nesting dolls unmade and laid out in a row. Each one a secret chamber. The first ones you'd see, they'd be the ones the news boys had chewed on, scandal and whispers clinging to their walls. But turn your back on those, and the ones next door, the ones after that, they hold a different kind of story.  \n\nAcross the road, a college satellite campus, a whisper of learning against the sunbaked asphalt. Students trailing in, coffee cups in hand, yawning like the world hadn't quite woken up yet. The iron gates groan open, letting them in one by one, while commuters curse them, shaking their fists, impatient for the road to be theirs again. \n\nThe road runs into another street, lined with houses and a park. On one side the park, children whirling in the sun, a blur of legs and laughter. On the other, a place for mending broken bones, a haven for the injured. Cheerful furniture spills out onto the porch, a ceiling fan sighing in the humid air, pushing the heat back and forth like a restless spirit. \n\nA sushi place hums beside the park, cheap eats and the quiet clinking of chopsticks. A swimming supply store, a nail salon, all nestled together in the strip mall. A frozen yogurt place, the kind where kids pile on the toppings, their cups sweating in the sun, their laughter as bright and sharp as broken glass.\n\nThis place, it's a picture postcard, faded and cracked, a glimpse of a time that's gone and come back around again. The south, slow and sweet, where the days stretch long and nothing ever truly changes, not even time itself.",
            "\"Where's everything?\" she asked, the car rumbling past fields of corn that stretched to the horizon. An endless sea of green, she'd never seen such a thing. This close to the earth, it was a different life altogether.  \"This is it,\" I said, knowing the emptiness would take her aback. She'd grown up where the grocery store was a stone's throw from your door. Open space wasn't in her blood. \n\nI told her about growing up in the Ohio dust, the endless fields, the way the wind could whip across the land and steal your breath. In that moment, she saw a part of me she hadn't known was there.\n\nDown a two-lane road, past a quarry filled with the still water of a forgotten lake, the houses huddled together like sheep. Brick and stucco, each with a half acre of land, a patch of green to call their own. Come spring, the flowers would burst forth, a riot of color against the backdrop of the changing seasons. Driveways would fill with high-gloss Mercedes, gleaming like beetles in the midday sun after a bath.\n\nMy neighbor, a Korean man, would be out there, his John Deere mower humming a lonely tune. He'd been a doctor once, they said, but now he tended his lawn with the devotion of a priest tending to his altar. He'd sing a little, sometimes, his voice thin and reedy, but always kind. They all laughed at him, but he didn't seem to mind. He was a good man, a quiet man, with stories etched into his face.\n\nPast his house, mine stood, grey stucco against the endless blue. Geese honked from the side yard, our terrier snapping at their heels. Behind the house, a stream ran clear and cold, feeding the quarry. Bullfrogs croaked, and the low moo of a distant cow filled the air. A handmade wooden bridge led to an oasis, untouched and wild, a tangle of trees and wildflowers. That's where I spent my days, building forts, chasing rabbits, dreaming.\n\nWinter came hard, a cold fist clenching around the land. The green turned brown, the trees bare skeletons against the grey sky. But the snow, when it came, was a blessing. A blanket of white, covering the world in silence. Snow angels lay in the yard, snowmen stood guard. My sister and I, we'd wage war in the snow, building forts of packed snow, our weapons snowballs hard as rocks. We were kings and queens of our own little kingdom, unaware of the world beyond our winter wonderland.",
            "You come to Portland, Oregon, you gotta understand something 'bout weird. It ain't just a word, it's a way of life.  See that sign on the side of that building, the one that serves up pizza by day and god knows what by night? \"Keep Portland Weird\" it says. Some reckon it's a whisper from the past, a ghost of the 90s, a time when this town was tucked away, cheaper and quieter, breeding its own strange breeds. Others, they hear it as a siren song, a call to come find acceptance, a place where different ain't a dirty word, it's a badge of honor.  \n\nBut the Californians keep pouring in, their money and their condos changing the landscape. Still, weird persists. It ain't about wallowing in some kind of radical acceptance, no sir. It's about finding a space for things that don't fit, things that make others squint and turn away. Like the rest of these United States, we buy our trinkets from the same distant shores.  We get our yoga, our hipsters, our suits and ties. Maybe weird just means we look at it all a little sideways.  \n\nTake my neighborhood, for instance.  You got houses painted in colors that'd make a fool blush, gardens bursting with flowers and herbs and things you can eat lining the sidewalks. And in the summer, the free boxes appear. Cardboard boxes, plastic bags, anything goes.  They hold the detritus of someone's life, cast off, abandoned. But inside, there's magic. A dress, a book, a tool, something unexpected, something meant for you. It ain't necessarily a treasure, but it's a possibility. That's Portland, ain't it? A place where the everyday holds a touch of the strange. \n\nThere's goat yoga, that's a thing here.  And soccer.  You got those who chase dreams, and those who chase the bottom of a bottle. We got our problems, sure.  Drugs, homelessness, the same old ghosts haunting every American town.  But even in the rain and the grey, there's a strange kind of beauty, a resilience. We're not so different, you and me, from the rest of them. We just wear our weirdness a little more proudly.",
            "The mountains. They were always there. Northward, sentinels against the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawns and dusks. A silent witness to it all.  Even when the mind went numb, consumed by the grind of things, they were there. Steady. Unmoved.  Unflinching.  And on those days when the weight of the world pressed down, when the soul felt frayed, they called to him.  A beckoning. A promise of solace.  He turned then, and in their presence, found a measure of peace. A strength to carry on. One day at a time.\n\nHe'd come here for college, drawn in by the mountains that clawed at the sky north of the campus. The university itself, with its halls and gardens, held a certain beauty, a kind of order. But the mountains, they held the throne. The town, in its own way, was a thing of grace. Cafés, stained with the ghosts of all-nighters fuelled by caffeine and ambition.  A short walk, a rumble of the bus, and the downtown hummed with a different kind of life.  Brick buildings, faded and worn, whispering of a past long gone.  Old stories etched in mortar. And then, a few streets on, the quiet of the suburbs returned. A library, a haven in a world of noise. This dance between the old and the new, the bustling and the still, it gave the place a strange kind of magic.\n\nMemories were made here, sharp and bright as shattered glass.  Laughter echoing through the park, the rusted swings creaking a mournful tune.  The rush of the city, a desperate sprint to catch a glimpse of the silver screen.  But there were shadows too, cast long and cold.  The ponds, still and reflecting, held their own sorrows. Tears shed in the dead of night, lost in the vastness of the world.  He watched the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each playing their part in the grand scheme.  And he wondered, for the hundredth time, about his own place in it all.\n\nHe walked, past the willow trees, past the houses that huddled together like frightened children.  He walked until the sun, a molten fist, broke over the horizon.  And then, he saw them. The mountains.  Staring down, unyielding, a silent testament to the passage of time. And in that moment, something stirred within him. A spark of defiance. A will to endure.",
            "The roads in Bensonhurst cling to the city like moss to stone. Finding it ain't hard.  The iron horse runs through it, spitting out souls from the belly of the beast. It's a place where concrete meets the sky, a symphony of car horns and the rumble of the subway.  Everywhere you turn, the scent of a thousand kitchens, the rattle of a thousand languages.  \n\nThe shops, they're like sentinels, mostly Asian faces behind the counters. You'll see them every block, a tapestry of bright signs promising cheap rice and spices. Markets overflowing with vegetables, laundromats churning like the river. Locals swear by them, say the food is good, the prices fair.  \n\nBut Bensonhurst ain't just a mosaic of faces. It's a crucible, where generations clash and mingle.  A kid born to Korean parents spitting out curses in Brooklynese.  A grandparent, eyes clouded with the ghosts of a homeland lost, pushing a stroller down the sidewalk.\n\nThere's a park, recently patched up, a sliver of green in the sea of grey.  A dozen basketball courts, a field where the ghosts of Little League dreams still linger.  Kids screaming, fathers arguing, the air thick with the smell of damp earth and sweat.  \n\nNo towering office blocks here, just rows of houses, two families crammed into each, the walls thin as paper.  And the noise, God, the noise.  Cars roaring down the streets, engines spitting fire, radios blasting the latest sins.  \n\nAt night, the shadows lengthen.  The streets are slick with a kind of uneasy peace.  You hold your breath, watch your back.  The city's darkness has a way of bringing out the worst in folks.  \n\nPickpockets, bullies, the occasional flash of violence.  I've seen it all. Heard the screams.  Even felt the sting of a fist.  But Bensonhurst ain't all bad.  It's a place where you learn to survive, to fight for every inch of ground.  It's a place where you come face to face with the raw, unfiltered heart of the city.",
            "The street runs slantwise down to the water, a crooked ribbon of cracked and crumbling asphalt.  Few sidewalks grace these parts, the sidewalkless road swallowed by the steep grade. They call it the \"work out hill,\" a kind of cruel joke for the runners who hammer their way up its face each day.  The houses cling to the shoulder of the slope, proud structures stacked high with glass eyes that stare out at the bay.  Always the bay. Always the hunger for the water.  The trees, those green sentinels, are an enemy here.  They must be cut back, pruned, trimmed, to give way to the endless vista.  The wires strung above, telephone and power, hang in tattered strands, their patchwork repairs testament to the storms that roll in from the sea.  Rain and wind, they come together in a ceaseless assault, stripping the bark from the trees, snapping branches, bringing down the lines.\n\nMoss, a green velvet, covers everything.  It creeps across roofs and cars, clings to the rusted railing of porch steps.  My car, left unattended in the driveway for a month, sprouted a thick coat of it, green and furry. Took hours to scrub it clean.\n\nChildren are scarce, but the schoolhouse stands sentinel a few blocks down. Mostly old folk live here, their days spent watching the tides and tending to their dogs.  Those dogs, they roam free, a pack of restless spirits, racing each other down the hill, noses twitching, tails wagging.  A loose window, an open door, and they'll be inside, their wet noses nudging your hand, their eyes pleading for a scratch.  Rabbits are feral here, a war waged between gardeners and hunters. My cats, sleek and nimble, have driven them from our yard.  Birds flit through the trees, sparrows and hummingbirds, a hawk or eagle occasionally soaring overhead until the crows, defenders of the sky, drive it away.\n\nDown by the water, a scattering of restaurants offer fresh catches from the bay, their tables spilling out onto the weathered docks.  No wide beach here, just rocky shores.  The bay, narrow and gray, offers a view of the distant shore, the outline hazy through the perpetual mist.",
            "The house sits at the corner, a front porch sentinel overlooking the thoroughfare. A ribbon of asphalt, choked by oaks and pines, connecting two blacktop arteries that bled through the town. Traffic, a steady murmur, a relentless current. Not a bad place, though. A quiet kind of livin'. Faces you see daily, the same weathered hands tending gardens, the same kids on bikes, the same dogs with stumpy legs and mournful eyes. Faces you know like the lines on your own palm. We work from the house. Me, the wife, the daughters, eleven and fourteen, shadows flitting in and out. We're part of the fabric here, the hum.\n\nWinter brings a brief respite from the heat, a dusting of snow that melts quick, leaving the children to slide down the hill that runs beside our street. We watch them from the porch, the smoke from our fire pit curling like ghosts against the leaden sky. Sometimes, a stranger's car, a foreign mark on the asphalt, rouses our curiosity.\n\nThe smell of grilling hangs heavy on the air sometimes, a reminder of summer nights and the slow, sweet rot of fallen leaves. Fall comes, a slow burn of gold and crimson, leaves crackling underfoot, a brittle whisper against the wind.\n\nThe garage, a sanctuary at the back of the house, a place of tools and work. When the doors rise, it feels like the neighborhood breathes in. On holidays, the air thickens with the murmur of voices, the slam of car doors. A brief intrusion, then, silence again.\n\nIt's a good place, quiet, familiar. A place where time moves slow, where the sun paints the trees in shades of rust and gold. A place where you can feel the pulse of the earth beneath your feet.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust. That's all that is. Brown. A tapestry of brown. The lawns, the few that dare to exist, are islands of green, monuments to a kind of desperate hope. Back in the nineties, the houses spread thin, like bones in the sand. Now they're closer, huddled together. This place, it's turning into something else. More like a city. \n\nPeople here, mostly good. Friendly. But like any place, there's a darkness, a shadow in the corners. The old folks around here, they're the kindest. Maybe that's why it feels safe. \n\nStores are chains. Food for Less, Smart & Final. The kind of places that sell cheap comfort.  You want something else, something better, you gotta drive.  Whole Foods, those things, they don't exist here.\n\nConstruction. That's the work. The dust in the air, the clang of hammers, the scrape of metal. This place is still young, still growing. It scares me, this spreading, this taking.  I left the city once. Not going back.\n\nMy hands, they know the feel of drywall, the bite of T-bars.  That's my trade.  \n\nThere's a beauty here, a starkness, a kind of quiet violence. Animals, they live here too. Lizards, bugs, things that scurry in the shadows. My kids, they love them. They chase them, study them.\n\nThe desert, it has its things.  Fairs, museums, mountains that wear white in the winter.  They call it Victorville. A place to see, a place to forget.  But it's a place that gets under your skin.",
            "The neighborhood.  A word that holds a weight different for some.  Folks talkin' 'bout their brick and mortar, their picket fences, their lawns mowed to a razor's edge.  Me, I reckon my neighborhood's different.  Walls ain't brick, but concrete and steel.  Fences, there are none.  The houses, they're dormitories, stacked high, holdin' a hundred souls each.  And the people, well, they're a motley crew.  Fresh faces, eyes wide with somethin' akin to hope, maybe fear.  Older ones, weathered by semesters past, carryin' the weight of knowledge like a burden.\n\nThere are three kinds of shelter in this place.  Apartments, cramped quarters for a handful, four or five souls to a room.  Then the houses, scattered like lonely sentinels, holdin' the alumni, them who've seen the world outside these walls.  And the dormitories, vast, echoing halls, where dreams are made and broken.  \n\nThe stores, they're a lifeline.  Grinding down burgers, slinging coffee, sellin' textbooks and T-shirts with the school's name emblazoned across them like a badge of honor.  And the park, a patch of green amidst the gray, a place for weary souls to find a moment's peace.\n\nThis neighborhood, it ain't like any other.  It's a crucible, forgin' lives, shapin' destinies.  It's a world unto itself, a microcosm of the world beyond.  And I, I'm just a small part of it.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  The dust settled different here in Stockbridge than it did back in Riverdale. It choked the air with a kind of sorrow I couldn't outrun.  Tears came easy then, for the ghosts of friends and laughter left behind. My folks, they talked of opportunity, of a better life for us, a life beyond the shadows.  They said Stockbridge would be good for us, a place to build a future. A place to be something more.\n\nThere was Mr. Glen and his children next door, always a flicker of light in the fading day. And Dennis, for a while, he was a fleeting warmth.  They became family, a thread of kinship in this strange new land.  I remember Mr. Glen's wedding, the sun sinking low over the horizon, the dust rising with each joyous footstep.  His bride, Ms. Veda, shed her white strap, a fragile thing that caught in my hand.  I didn't catch the flowers, but the memory lingers, a bittersweet bloom.\n\nThe neighborhood itself is a labyrinth, winding streets and hidden corners.  I used to navigate it blind, but now I have a guide, a metal box that whispers the way.  Kason and Curtis, they're my anchors here, the only constant in this shifting world.  We played games, chased shadows, sought solace in the flickering light of screens.  Sometimes, I'd wander to the park, where the wind whispered through the leaves and the air tasted of earth and silence.  There, I'd find a measure of peace, a quiet understanding.  I'd practice with my bokken, feel the weight of it in my hand, a promise of strength.\n\nThe basketball court stands silent, the net hanging limp. The tennis court, too, waits for the echo of bouncing balls, the clash of rackets.  My father, he taught me the game, the grace and fury of it all.  Mr. Graves, a gruff but kind man, he molded us, shaped us with sweat and discipline.\n\nThere are stories here, etched in the dust and whispers of the wind.  Stories of laughter and loss, of joy and sorrow.  These are the things that have marked my time here, the things that have made this place a part of me.\n\nBut the best is yet to come. The sun still rises, painting the sky with hope. And I, I am ready to greet it.",
            "The college sits close enough to walk, a fact that holds a certain comfort. The neighborhood, mostly blocks of brick and concrete, holds a few flickering lights of bars and eateries, places where the young and the worn gather, the cost of entry not unreasonable. One such place changed hands recently, its prices climbing, but the liquor flowed and the stories lingered. The faces here are mostly college boys and girls, or men and women worn thin by circumstance, drawn to the low rents. Children run barefoot in the streets, the sound of their laughter echoing off the faded walls, their haven a schoolhouse within shouting distance.\n\nI keep to myself, a solitary figure amidst the murmur of life. The people here, they smoke their weeds, a constant haze hanging in the air. The building manager, in his wisdom, installed an air freshener across from their door, a feeble attempt to mask the scent. A grim joke, a silent indictment.\n\nThe buildings themselves are old, their bones showing through the patched-up skin. Newer ones stand further down the street, gleaming faces with hollow insides. Cheaply built, they stand as monuments to greed, their rents a testament to the desperation of youth. A few blocks over, a greasy spoon serves its fare on paper plates, the aroma of microwaved mystery clinging to the air. Across the street, a gas station, a place of weary souls and broken promises.\n\nBut the city, in its infinite benevolence, redid the road last summer. A broad sidewalk now snakes through the neighborhood, lined with grass and trimmed trees. It's a poor attempt to mask the ugliness, but a gesture nonetheless.\n\nMy apartment building, it stands shrouded in trees, a few stumps marking the sacrifice of some fallen giants. The road behind it, 43rd Street, is a different beast altogether. The sidewalks are cracked and crumbling, the buildings lean and desperate. Trees cling to the edges, trying to hide the rot beneath. \n\nThe crime, it whispers in the shadows, a constant threat. Not confined to one place, it spreads like a disease, infecting the vulnerable.\nBut I make my home here. The rent is low, and the necessities are at hand. The college, a beacon of hope, sits within walking distance. Two bus stops offer a gateway to the wider world. I exist here, a small note in the symphony of the city, a fleeting breath in the face of the endless night.",
            "The houses here, they squat low, twins on a muted curve. Not crowded, not lonely. Yellow paint, white porches, roofs like rusted tin. Most folks know each other. We gather at dusk, at the end of driveways that lead nowhere in particular. Small voices chatter, children chasing dust devils and ghosts in the fading light. A breath of stillness in this world of clockwork and cold steel. Like stepping back, maybe.\n\nFields stretch out, emerald and gold, under skies the color of a summer sky. Clouds, like cotton blown loose, drift by. But there's a shadow over this peace. The wind whispers warnings of things unseen, of teeth tearing at the world. Last night, the sirens screamed, a chorus of steel and fear. I found myself in the tub, my smallest dog pressed against my chest, my purse and a few pillows for company. The big one wouldn't budge, whimpering, pacing the living room. Out there, the sky cracked open with hail, fat and angry, drumming on the roof. After the storm, the air hung thick, the ground steaming like a wound. Heat and cold, a sudden, brutal dance. Then, a light, a rupture in the grey. A double rainbow arched across the sky, a fragile promise. I grabbed my phone, the screen catching the light, and snapped pictures, trying to hold the beauty before it faded. \n\nThe world settled, quiet again, save for the chirping of crickets. Then, slow, the neighborhood stirred. Doors opened, children ran, laughter spilled out. Back to the rhythm of things. Mom's stirring pots, children chasing fireflies.\n\nThis place, it's a haven. Forty minutes from the city, but a world away. The folks here, they speak slow, their words like honey. Two rooms, two baths, that's all we need. But inside, each house is a story waiting to be told.\n\nI walk out back, past the fields, to the pond, still and silent. Deer graze in the shadows, and the bullfrog's song, a deep rumble, fills the morning air. A rooster crows, a lonely sound in the vastness. A donkey brays, somewhere in the distance. A small community, a piece of the old world. I found my peace here.",
            "The house stood empty when I came. Eighth grade. A year of shadows. Made friends slow, like roots burrowing deep. Two boys, down the street, a house two over. They're gone now, but the ghosts of their laughter still linger in the porch swing. The old folks, they're still here, faces etched with the stories of the years. \n\nSame houses, two stories reaching for a sky that never seems to change. Kids on the street, their voices a symphony of summer days. Mostly quiet, this place. You're left alone unless you need something. Packages sit safe on the stoop, untouched. Trust hangs in the air, thin but real.\n\nThere's a park, a stone's throw away. Memories live there too, etched on the worn swings and cracked asphalt. Ball games, laughter, the sting of a well-aimed elbow to the nose. Football days, the sun a furnace in the sky. Now, it's the young ones, my cousin's brood, their faces lit with the joy of slides and swings. Their laughter, a echo of a past life. The park, a well of quiet longing.\n\nFood smells drift on the wind. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian. A world in a mile's radius. But the world has changed. Now, food arrives at the doorstep, a Ghostly offering from apps and screens. Fast food reigns, a familiar comfort. Pizza, a solace for the weary soul. The stores, they have everything. Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store with aisles that stretch to eternity. Even a shop, Indian-owned, smelling of spices and home.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a haven. A place where the light is still warm, where the air carries the scent of home. Reading the news, seeing the darkness in other places, makes me grateful for this quiet corner of the world. A place where neighbors are more than just faces on a street.",
            "The town sits small, nestled in the Carolina heat. A peach town, they call it, the world's peach capital they say, though that sign hanging crooked at the edge of town don't mean much to the wind.  Fields crawl out from the houses, one neat row of trees or another, cattle grazing under the sun.  Houses stand back from the road, two stories high, metal roofs glinting like scars against the blue, or gray shingles worn thin by years. Few of them face the dust, most turned inward. \n\nA lone light hangs over the crossroads, a single eye blinking in the stillness. Three places to eat, maybe four if you count the Chinese place. Hong Kong, they call it, run by a family silent as the graves. Fiesta, bright enough to burn your eyes, and Gary's, where the burgers are flat and the grease hangs heavy. The pizza place closed down, leaving a hollow space in the air. \n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, a name worn thin with time. They sell cherry Coke, sweet and dark, like the secrets the town keeps. The IGA, a little store with a big name, crammed full of things you need and things you don't.  Folks go there for a carton of milk, a loaf of bread, but the real shopping's done in Batesburg-Leesville, down the road. Dollar General, though, that's where the heart of the town beats. Crowded and humming, a place where you can find anything and everything. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, built solid as the earth. A kind woman runs it, knows everyone's name, knows their stories. Clark's Cuts and Kennels sits attached, a place for dogs to be groomed and loved.  The doctor's office and the vet, both small, tucked away like secrets.  A single schoolhouse, teaching children the alphabet and the ways of the world. \n\nNo parks, no laughter in the streets, just the quiet rustle of leaves and the low hum of cicadas. They're building a place for kids to play, a patch of green in the dusty landscape. But still, it's a town that sleeps, a place where time slows down and secrets breed like rabbits.  You could drive right through without knowing it, a blink and you'd miss it.",
            "The first time the name of this place drifted into my ears, it was on some vanished voices podcast. A tale of disappearances. Strange thing, considering the rent here. A thousand a month, easy. Never heard a whisper of it, not from any of the boys I knew. Maybe it's the struggle. Some nights I see them, eyes red-rimmed, hollowed out, weeping. The cost of living, a heavy stone in the gut. But we've learned to mend with scraps. The scent of moth-eaten things, the dusty charm of flea market finds. You learn to smell less, in time. Or maybe the smoke gets you. Whatever the case, the flea market, it always calls. The smell of adulthood, a musty echo of time. Dusty magazines piled on a silent piano. It sinks into the leather, a stain that won't wash out. Here, three thrift shops within walking distance. Start at the edge and you can tick off two charities, a library, a bookstore old as sin, and a curio shop crammed full of whispers. Downtown, a river of iron and flesh, choked with cars and people every morning. But the silence in those shops, it's a shroud. No matter the traffic, the din, the silence holds. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more of them, the cars and the people. They call it development, I guess. A city growing its bones, hosting the titans of online commerce. Still, the pangs of progress, they show. Like New York, I reckon. Everyone with their own face set, their own path. No one asking much of you. You can be a ghost, quiet and alone, and no one bats an eye. Not like the South, where a sigh means you care. Here, they keep their lives shut tight. You can wear your mask as long as you like, and the city will roll on, waves against the shore. A lively place, though. Between the pianist next door and the two souls upstairs, always a melody hanging in the air. We ain't strangers here, not quite. We gather for needs, for birthdays, for funerals, for each other when the going gets rough. Lucky, I reckon. Most of the neighbors, decent folks. Treat me right, I return the favor. Food left on the stoop, mail delivered, a hand extended. A smile, a nod. Makes a man feel less alone in this concrete jungle.",
            "The place I call home, it sprawls out like a grid of sameness.  Rows of houses, each a mirror image of the next, all singing the same song of conformity.  The Homeowners' Association, a silent shepherd, dictates the tune.  Every yard a uniform stage set: a patch of manicured green, pebbles scattered like glacial drift, and driveways short enough for the soul to tire before the car.  The occasional tree, stunted and pruned, stands witness.  Two-car garages, all identical, line the streets.  Concrete, newly laid and smooth as a preacher's promise, stretches on, a testament to order.  Families come and go, but the roads remain unblemished, free of the scars of time and broken dreams.\n\nMost houses, one story, rooted in the earth.  Some reach for the sky, two stories tall, like prayers unanswered.  Mailboxes, not the lonely sentinels you'd expect, but a huddled cluster at the end of the lane, guarded and uniform.  Keys turn, metal groans, and the secrets of daily life are retrieved.  Lockers stand sentinel for packages, their metal hearts cold and uncaring.  The HOA, its hand in every detail, its grip tight.\n\nMy house sits on the edge of the city, a place where the urban bleeds into the wild.  We have land here, plenty of it.  Pools, fenced and shimmering, offer a taste of paradise.  Trails wind through the green, paths for those who seek solace in the rustling leaves and the murmur of the wind.  Exercise, not a chore, but a rite of passage in this land of open spaces.\n\nThe people here, mostly old, their faces etched with the stories of lives lived.  Their eyes hold a quiet wisdom, a knowingness born of years.  There are a few younger faces, these newcomers, lost in the labyrinth of ambition.  But all are connected, bound by the invisible threads of this small town, a place where strangers become neighbors, and neighbors become family.\n\nThe city, though vast, whispers of a time gone by.  A single mall, a monolith of commerce, stands as a testament to our needs and desires.  Fifteen minutes, a blink in the grand scheme of things, and the world opens up, a kaleidoscope of choices.  From the purveyors of organic greens to the masters of discounted dreams, there's a place for every soul. \n\nThis is my home.  Safe, predictable, and yet, somehow, still yearning for something more.",
            "The town sits low, a bruise on the flank of the city.  East side. That's where I dwell.  Houses huddle close, weathered wood and chipped paint.  Folks here, they scrape by. Renters and owners, all with eyes that have seen hard times.  But there's a kind of quiet grace in their faces.  A nod on the street, a word shared, the air thick with understanding.  \n\nCrime, it crawls like a weed in the cracks.  A few shots in the night, a life pinched out too soon.  Lost a boy next door, they did.  Taken by a bullet outside some darkened bar.  The echoes still linger.  We've had things go missing, a coat left on the porch, a bike left unlocked.  Just the way of things here.\n\nThe sickness, that's the real shadow.  The white powder, a whisper on the wind, taking hold, stealing breath.  They say it's everywhere, this curse.  But here, there are hands reaching out, trying to pull folks back from the edge.  Places to mend, to find a foothold.  A flicker of hope.\n\nBut the school, it's a haven.  Teachers with hearts as big as the sky, guiding young minds.  My son, he struggles, but they see him, they hold him up.  No scorn, no whispers.  Just kindness, a steady hand.  The PTO, they work hard, keeping the spirit alive, bringing families together.  Free meals for every child, so no empty stomachs at the table.  They understand, they care.\n\nThe town itself, it's a patchwork.  New roads, blooming flowers, parks freshly painted, all on the west side, where the money flows.  But here, on the east side, the cracks show deeper.  A feeling of being forgotten.\n\nStill, I love it here.  The quiet strength, the shared burdens, the hard-won beauty.  This town, it's in my blood now.  We've made it our own.  And even though there's darkness, there's also light.  A stubborn, enduring light.",
            "The Hill holds its breath against the city. Seven stories above, I look out at the old theater, brick and shadow, a relic of what was. Down the slope, a flicker of neon betrays the arcade bar, a den of laughter and hushed whispers on summer nights. The line spills out, a river of faces seeking solace in the dark. A few blocks on, the park rises, walled in concrete, steps leading up like broken teeth. Winter comes, a grey shroud, and the men and women take shelter, tents in neat rows along the sidewalk, huddled against the city's bones. They share the scant warmth, closer to the family center, a flicker of hope in the cold, where they might find a moment's peace. \n\nThe Hill wasn't always this way. Stories linger, whispers in the wind, of the days when shadows danced with violence, of the men in suits, the badges gleaming, sweeping through the streets like a storm. They say the ghosts of those days still walk among us, etched into the faces of the people who call it home. They work hard, these people, their hands calloused, their hearts weary. They tend to their streets, fight for a sliver of light in the darkness. They warn the newcomers, the pale faces who wander in at night, \"Don't walk alone after dark.\"  A shadow of the old fears, a whisper of the past.\n\nMaybe it's the way the light catches my skin, maybe it's the way I walk, blending into the shadows. But the Hill sees something in me, a kindred spirit. It sees the scars, the reminders that we are all searching for something, something more than this, something better. It sees the fight, the struggle, the yearning for a world where the only shadows are those cast by the setting sun. \n\nI walk these streets, feeling the pulse of the city beneath my feet. I see kindness in the lines on their faces, hear it in their voices, feel it in the warmth of a shared smile. This is my home, this rough, beautiful place. This is where I belong.",
            "The land here stretches flat as a dead man's hand. Farmland gives way to towns that cater to the summer crowd, the kind with boat keys jingling in their pockets and flip-flops slapping on the pavement. No towering steel and glass here, no chains with names like Applebee's or Target.  You want something, you gotta drive for it.  But there's beauty in the vastness.  Two Great Lakes hug this place, Michigan's dark water on one side, Charlevoix's turquoise mirror on the other.  Every turn offers a dip in the sand, a taste of the cool current.  \n\nThe houses are scattered, not crammed like teeth in a mouthful.  They're old bones, some patched and freshened, others with the patina of time worn into their skin.  Siding the color of tarnished silver, a faded testament to summers past.  Every shade imaginable, like a child's box of crayons spilled across the street.  Yards, choked with weeds maybe, or manicured tight, each telling a story.  Kids on swings, dogs chasing squirrels, gardens bursting with life. This is the heart of it, the backbone of the country.  Hard-working folks, raising families, the rhythm of life pulsing slow and steady.\n\nYou'll see the sheriff's station, solid and squat, like a watchful dog.  The jail next door, a reminder that darkness lurks even in the quietest corners. The health department, too, a beacon of order in the chaos.  Down the road, the recycling center, where the refuse of life is reborn. And the baseball field, where the crack of the bat echoes through the dusk.  The airport, a tiny speck on the horizon, spitting out dreams on wings of steel.\n\nThis is a place you don't come to for the spectacle.  It's a place to settle, to put down roots.  A place where the air is clean and the stars are bright.  It's a place where you can raise your children, knowing they'll grow strong and true.  It's a place where you can finally rest."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "The city sprawls, a concrete and steel beast. Neighborhoods stitched together in a haphazard quilt, commerce bleeding into residence. Shops and offices pressed tight against each other, a dizzying array of storefront signs bleeding neon into the dusk. Eating places, a constant hum of ovens and sizzling grease, promising quick sustenance. Big chains with their cold, sterile promises, and smaller shops, tucked along the choked streets, whispers of individuality. Parks, green islands in the gray, choked with the laughter of children and the drone of cicadas. \n\nFaces, a kaleidoscope of shades and tongues.  Here a cluster of rainbow flags, there a synagogue, its windows a lattice of prayer. A scattering of souls, displaced, from the cold wastelands of the East. Beyond the immediate sprawl, the city’s heart beats with a thousand nameless rhythms. Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia – pockets of the world nestled against each other, miles swallowed by the city’s endless maw.  Iron horses on steel tracks, choked by exhaust and the weight of a thousand journeys.  Ten miles, a journey into the belly of the beast, a crawl through time. \n\nConcrete canyons rise, new towers reaching for a sky choked with smog.  Promises of easy living, a tide of souls drawn to the city’s siren song. But old wounds fester, the neighborhood’s heart grows heavy with the burden of too many. \n\nHouses, a patchwork of dreams. Some stand alone, sentinels against the encroaching tide. Others huddle together, families seeking solace in shared walls. Even here, in the heart of the city, the human spirit seeks connection. But the streets are long and the shadows deep. Faces pass, strangers in the anonymity of the city. Memories linger, of laughter and shared secrets, a child's world fading in the city's relentless churn.",
            "The houses huddled close, most single-family, some split, two lives breathin' in one skin. My own sits on a patch of lawn, a drive beside it cracked and thirsty. Like the others, it remembers a time when this was the dream, the edges of the country tamed, promise in every picket fence. Now the dream's pullin' away, leavin' a chill in the air. But the houses hold on, whisperin' the old stories, a stubborn echo in the wind. \n\nFolks ain't as bright-eyed as they used to be. Lawns ain't kept like they used to be. But the cars still sit, iron nests in the drives, and the children play, the world their own. The school, a brick sentinel standin' near ninety years, still calls to the young, stirs the ghosts in the old. Churches sit empty, hollow bones against the sky, but the courts echo with the slap of sneakers, the sharp cries of the game.\n\nEach house different, yet the same ache in their bones. The Super \"A\" stands tall, a concrete monolith, run by a family from a land far away, their faces veiled. Black faces fill the streets, generations deep. The children kick a ball, the air thick with dust and hope. The youth remember a time when everyone knew everyone. The karate school, a memory now, replaced by a place where pills promise answers. The movie theater shows old films, a flicker of light in the dusk, favored by the old, who remember a time when stories unfolded on a silver screen.\n\nA ribbon of road slices through the town, but the on and off ramps lie beyond, in another's domain. There was talk of a change, a new path, a way to ease the flow. The young yearned for it, the old resisted, their grip on the past a thorny vine. Now a new school rises, a monument to the future, and the town debates its spirit, its soul. A cyborg, they say, with a drawl and a log cabin, a strange reflection of a world caught between the old and the new.",
            "You might pass it over, this place. Just another row of houses behind the bony ribs of a dead shopping center. Not the kind of place you'd think to find  dwellings, not the kind folks yearn for. But if you cut through the rust and the weeds behind the husk of that old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty most of the year, filled only with ghosts of summer reunions, you'd find it. A whole world tucked in behind the shadows. \n\nApartment blocks huddled there, like nesting dolls unmade and laid out in a row. Each one a secret chamber. The first ones you'd see, they'd be the ones the news boys had chewed on, scandal and whispers clinging to their walls. But turn your back on those, and the ones next door, the ones after that, they hold a different kind of story.  \n\nAcross the road, a college satellite campus, a whisper of learning against the sunbaked asphalt. Students trailing in, coffee cups in hand, yawning like the world hadn't quite woken up yet. The iron gates groan open, letting them in one by one, while commuters curse them, shaking their fists, impatient for the road to be theirs again. \n\nThe road runs into another street, lined with houses and a park. On one side the park, children whirling in the sun, a blur of legs and laughter. On the other, a place for mending broken bones, a haven for the injured. Cheerful furniture spills out onto the porch, a ceiling fan sighing in the humid air, pushing the heat back and forth like a restless spirit. \n\nA sushi place hums beside the park, cheap eats and the quiet clinking of chopsticks. A swimming supply store, a nail salon, all nestled together in the strip mall. A frozen yogurt place, the kind where kids pile on the toppings, their cups sweating in the sun, their laughter as bright and sharp as broken glass.\n\nThis place, it's a picture postcard, faded and cracked, a glimpse of a time that's gone and come back around again. The south, slow and sweet, where the days stretch long and nothing ever truly changes, not even time itself.",
            "\"Where's everything?\" she asked, the car rumbling past fields of corn that stretched to the horizon. An endless sea of green, she'd never seen such a thing. This close to the earth, it was a different life altogether.  \"This is it,\" I said, knowing the emptiness would take her aback. She'd grown up where the grocery store was a stone's throw from your door. Open space wasn't in her blood. \n\nI told her about growing up in the Ohio dust, the endless fields, the way the wind could whip across the land and steal your breath. In that moment, she saw a part of me she hadn't known was there.\n\nDown a two-lane road, past a quarry filled with the still water of a forgotten lake, the houses huddled together like sheep. Brick and stucco, each with a half acre of land, a patch of green to call their own. Come spring, the flowers would burst forth, a riot of color against the backdrop of the changing seasons. Driveways would fill with high-gloss Mercedes, gleaming like beetles in the midday sun after a bath.\n\nMy neighbor, a Korean man, would be out there, his John Deere mower humming a lonely tune. He'd been a doctor once, they said, but now he tended his lawn with the devotion of a priest tending to his altar. He'd sing a little, sometimes, his voice thin and reedy, but always kind. They all laughed at him, but he didn't seem to mind. He was a good man, a quiet man, with stories etched into his face.\n\nPast his house, mine stood, grey stucco against the endless blue. Geese honked from the side yard, our terrier snapping at their heels. Behind the house, a stream ran clear and cold, feeding the quarry. Bullfrogs croaked, and the low moo of a distant cow filled the air. A handmade wooden bridge led to an oasis, untouched and wild, a tangle of trees and wildflowers. That's where I spent my days, building forts, chasing rabbits, dreaming.\n\nWinter came hard, a cold fist clenching around the land. The green turned brown, the trees bare skeletons against the grey sky. But the snow, when it came, was a blessing. A blanket of white, covering the world in silence. Snow angels lay in the yard, snowmen stood guard. My sister and I, we'd wage war in the snow, building forts of packed snow, our weapons snowballs hard as rocks. We were kings and queens of our own little kingdom, unaware of the world beyond our winter wonderland.",
            "You come to Portland, Oregon, you gotta understand something 'bout weird. It ain't just a word, it's a way of life.  See that sign on the side of that building, the one that serves up pizza by day and god knows what by night? \"Keep Portland Weird\" it says. Some reckon it's a whisper from the past, a ghost of the 90s, a time when this town was tucked away, cheaper and quieter, breeding its own strange breeds. Others, they hear it as a siren song, a call to come find acceptance, a place where different ain't a dirty word, it's a badge of honor.  \n\nBut the Californians keep pouring in, their money and their condos changing the landscape. Still, weird persists. It ain't about wallowing in some kind of radical acceptance, no sir. It's about finding a space for things that don't fit, things that make others squint and turn away. Like the rest of these United States, we buy our trinkets from the same distant shores.  We get our yoga, our hipsters, our suits and ties. Maybe weird just means we look at it all a little sideways.  \n\nTake my neighborhood, for instance.  You got houses painted in colors that'd make a fool blush, gardens bursting with flowers and herbs and things you can eat lining the sidewalks. And in the summer, the free boxes appear. Cardboard boxes, plastic bags, anything goes.  They hold the detritus of someone's life, cast off, abandoned. But inside, there's magic. A dress, a book, a tool, something unexpected, something meant for you. It ain't necessarily a treasure, but it's a possibility. That's Portland, ain't it? A place where the everyday holds a touch of the strange. \n\nThere's goat yoga, that's a thing here.  And soccer.  You got those who chase dreams, and those who chase the bottom of a bottle. We got our problems, sure.  Drugs, homelessness, the same old ghosts haunting every American town.  But even in the rain and the grey, there's a strange kind of beauty, a resilience. We're not so different, you and me, from the rest of them. We just wear our weirdness a little more proudly.",
            "The mountains. They were always there. Northward, sentinels against the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawns and dusks. A silent witness to it all.  Even when the mind went numb, consumed by the grind of things, they were there. Steady. Unmoved.  Unflinching.  And on those days when the weight of the world pressed down, when the soul felt frayed, they called to him.  A beckoning. A promise of solace.  He turned then, and in their presence, found a measure of peace. A strength to carry on. One day at a time.\n\nHe'd come here for college, drawn in by the mountains that clawed at the sky north of the campus. The university itself, with its halls and gardens, held a certain beauty, a kind of order. But the mountains, they held the throne. The town, in its own way, was a thing of grace. Cafés, stained with the ghosts of all-nighters fuelled by caffeine and ambition.  A short walk, a rumble of the bus, and the downtown hummed with a different kind of life.  Brick buildings, faded and worn, whispering of a past long gone.  Old stories etched in mortar. And then, a few streets on, the quiet of the suburbs returned. A library, a haven in a world of noise. This dance between the old and the new, the bustling and the still, it gave the place a strange kind of magic.\n\nMemories were made here, sharp and bright as shattered glass.  Laughter echoing through the park, the rusted swings creaking a mournful tune.  The rush of the city, a desperate sprint to catch a glimpse of the silver screen.  But there were shadows too, cast long and cold.  The ponds, still and reflecting, held their own sorrows. Tears shed in the dead of night, lost in the vastness of the world.  He watched the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each playing their part in the grand scheme.  And he wondered, for the hundredth time, about his own place in it all.\n\nHe walked, past the willow trees, past the houses that huddled together like frightened children.  He walked until the sun, a molten fist, broke over the horizon.  And then, he saw them. The mountains.  Staring down, unyielding, a silent testament to the passage of time. And in that moment, something stirred within him. A spark of defiance. A will to endure.",
            "The roads in Bensonhurst cling to the city like moss to stone. Finding it ain't hard.  The iron horse runs through it, spitting out souls from the belly of the beast. It's a place where concrete meets the sky, a symphony of car horns and the rumble of the subway.  Everywhere you turn, the scent of a thousand kitchens, the rattle of a thousand languages.  \n\nThe shops, they're like sentinels, mostly Asian faces behind the counters. You'll see them every block, a tapestry of bright signs promising cheap rice and spices. Markets overflowing with vegetables, laundromats churning like the river. Locals swear by them, say the food is good, the prices fair.  \n\nBut Bensonhurst ain't just a mosaic of faces. It's a crucible, where generations clash and mingle.  A kid born to Korean parents spitting out curses in Brooklynese.  A grandparent, eyes clouded with the ghosts of a homeland lost, pushing a stroller down the sidewalk.\n\nThere's a park, recently patched up, a sliver of green in the sea of grey.  A dozen basketball courts, a field where the ghosts of Little League dreams still linger.  Kids screaming, fathers arguing, the air thick with the smell of damp earth and sweat.  \n\nNo towering office blocks here, just rows of houses, two families crammed into each, the walls thin as paper.  And the noise, God, the noise.  Cars roaring down the streets, engines spitting fire, radios blasting the latest sins.  \n\nAt night, the shadows lengthen.  The streets are slick with a kind of uneasy peace.  You hold your breath, watch your back.  The city's darkness has a way of bringing out the worst in folks.  \n\nPickpockets, bullies, the occasional flash of violence.  I've seen it all. Heard the screams.  Even felt the sting of a fist.  But Bensonhurst ain't all bad.  It's a place where you learn to survive, to fight for every inch of ground.  It's a place where you come face to face with the raw, unfiltered heart of the city.",
            "The street runs slantwise down to the water, a crooked ribbon of cracked and crumbling asphalt.  Few sidewalks grace these parts, the sidewalkless road swallowed by the steep grade. They call it the \"work out hill,\" a kind of cruel joke for the runners who hammer their way up its face each day.  The houses cling to the shoulder of the slope, proud structures stacked high with glass eyes that stare out at the bay.  Always the bay. Always the hunger for the water.  The trees, those green sentinels, are an enemy here.  They must be cut back, pruned, trimmed, to give way to the endless vista.  The wires strung above, telephone and power, hang in tattered strands, their patchwork repairs testament to the storms that roll in from the sea.  Rain and wind, they come together in a ceaseless assault, stripping the bark from the trees, snapping branches, bringing down the lines.\n\nMoss, a green velvet, covers everything.  It creeps across roofs and cars, clings to the rusted railing of porch steps.  My car, left unattended in the driveway for a month, sprouted a thick coat of it, green and furry. Took hours to scrub it clean.\n\nChildren are scarce, but the schoolhouse stands sentinel a few blocks down. Mostly old folk live here, their days spent watching the tides and tending to their dogs.  Those dogs, they roam free, a pack of restless spirits, racing each other down the hill, noses twitching, tails wagging.  A loose window, an open door, and they'll be inside, their wet noses nudging your hand, their eyes pleading for a scratch.  Rabbits are feral here, a war waged between gardeners and hunters. My cats, sleek and nimble, have driven them from our yard.  Birds flit through the trees, sparrows and hummingbirds, a hawk or eagle occasionally soaring overhead until the crows, defenders of the sky, drive it away.\n\nDown by the water, a scattering of restaurants offer fresh catches from the bay, their tables spilling out onto the weathered docks.  No wide beach here, just rocky shores.  The bay, narrow and gray, offers a view of the distant shore, the outline hazy through the perpetual mist.",
            "The house sits at the corner, a front porch sentinel overlooking the thoroughfare. A ribbon of asphalt, choked by oaks and pines, connecting two blacktop arteries that bled through the town. Traffic, a steady murmur, a relentless current. Not a bad place, though. A quiet kind of livin'. Faces you see daily, the same weathered hands tending gardens, the same kids on bikes, the same dogs with stumpy legs and mournful eyes. Faces you know like the lines on your own palm. We work from the house. Me, the wife, the daughters, eleven and fourteen, shadows flitting in and out. We're part of the fabric here, the hum.\n\nWinter brings a brief respite from the heat, a dusting of snow that melts quick, leaving the children to slide down the hill that runs beside our street. We watch them from the porch, the smoke from our fire pit curling like ghosts against the leaden sky. Sometimes, a stranger's car, a foreign mark on the asphalt, rouses our curiosity.\n\nThe smell of grilling hangs heavy on the air sometimes, a reminder of summer nights and the slow, sweet rot of fallen leaves. Fall comes, a slow burn of gold and crimson, leaves crackling underfoot, a brittle whisper against the wind.\n\nThe garage, a sanctuary at the back of the house, a place of tools and work. When the doors rise, it feels like the neighborhood breathes in. On holidays, the air thickens with the murmur of voices, the slam of car doors. A brief intrusion, then, silence again.\n\nIt's a good place, quiet, familiar. A place where time moves slow, where the sun paints the trees in shades of rust and gold. A place where you can feel the pulse of the earth beneath your feet.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust. That's all that is. Brown. A tapestry of brown. The lawns, the few that dare to exist, are islands of green, monuments to a kind of desperate hope. Back in the nineties, the houses spread thin, like bones in the sand. Now they're closer, huddled together. This place, it's turning into something else. More like a city. \n\nPeople here, mostly good. Friendly. But like any place, there's a darkness, a shadow in the corners. The old folks around here, they're the kindest. Maybe that's why it feels safe. \n\nStores are chains. Food for Less, Smart & Final. The kind of places that sell cheap comfort.  You want something else, something better, you gotta drive.  Whole Foods, those things, they don't exist here.\n\nConstruction. That's the work. The dust in the air, the clang of hammers, the scrape of metal. This place is still young, still growing. It scares me, this spreading, this taking.  I left the city once. Not going back.\n\nMy hands, they know the feel of drywall, the bite of T-bars.  That's my trade.  \n\nThere's a beauty here, a starkness, a kind of quiet violence. Animals, they live here too. Lizards, bugs, things that scurry in the shadows. My kids, they love them. They chase them, study them.\n\nThe desert, it has its things.  Fairs, museums, mountains that wear white in the winter.  They call it Victorville. A place to see, a place to forget.  But it's a place that gets under your skin.",
            "The neighborhood.  A word that holds a weight different for some.  Folks talkin' 'bout their brick and mortar, their picket fences, their lawns mowed to a razor's edge.  Me, I reckon my neighborhood's different.  Walls ain't brick, but concrete and steel.  Fences, there are none.  The houses, they're dormitories, stacked high, holdin' a hundred souls each.  And the people, well, they're a motley crew.  Fresh faces, eyes wide with somethin' akin to hope, maybe fear.  Older ones, weathered by semesters past, carryin' the weight of knowledge like a burden.\n\nThere are three kinds of shelter in this place.  Apartments, cramped quarters for a handful, four or five souls to a room.  Then the houses, scattered like lonely sentinels, holdin' the alumni, them who've seen the world outside these walls.  And the dormitories, vast, echoing halls, where dreams are made and broken.  \n\nThe stores, they're a lifeline.  Grinding down burgers, slinging coffee, sellin' textbooks and T-shirts with the school's name emblazoned across them like a badge of honor.  And the park, a patch of green amidst the gray, a place for weary souls to find a moment's peace.\n\nThis neighborhood, it ain't like any other.  It's a crucible, forgin' lives, shapin' destinies.  It's a world unto itself, a microcosm of the world beyond.  And I, I'm just a small part of it.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  The dust settled different here in Stockbridge than it did back in Riverdale. It choked the air with a kind of sorrow I couldn't outrun.  Tears came easy then, for the ghosts of friends and laughter left behind. My folks, they talked of opportunity, of a better life for us, a life beyond the shadows.  They said Stockbridge would be good for us, a place to build a future. A place to be something more.\n\nThere was Mr. Glen and his children next door, always a flicker of light in the fading day. And Dennis, for a while, he was a fleeting warmth.  They became family, a thread of kinship in this strange new land.  I remember Mr. Glen's wedding, the sun sinking low over the horizon, the dust rising with each joyous footstep.  His bride, Ms. Veda, shed her white strap, a fragile thing that caught in my hand.  I didn't catch the flowers, but the memory lingers, a bittersweet bloom.\n\nThe neighborhood itself is a labyrinth, winding streets and hidden corners.  I used to navigate it blind, but now I have a guide, a metal box that whispers the way.  Kason and Curtis, they're my anchors here, the only constant in this shifting world.  We played games, chased shadows, sought solace in the flickering light of screens.  Sometimes, I'd wander to the park, where the wind whispered through the leaves and the air tasted of earth and silence.  There, I'd find a measure of peace, a quiet understanding.  I'd practice with my bokken, feel the weight of it in my hand, a promise of strength.\n\nThe basketball court stands silent, the net hanging limp. The tennis court, too, waits for the echo of bouncing balls, the clash of rackets.  My father, he taught me the game, the grace and fury of it all.  Mr. Graves, a gruff but kind man, he molded us, shaped us with sweat and discipline.\n\nThere are stories here, etched in the dust and whispers of the wind.  Stories of laughter and loss, of joy and sorrow.  These are the things that have marked my time here, the things that have made this place a part of me.\n\nBut the best is yet to come. The sun still rises, painting the sky with hope. And I, I am ready to greet it.",
            "The college sits close enough to walk, a fact that holds a certain comfort. The neighborhood, mostly blocks of brick and concrete, holds a few flickering lights of bars and eateries, places where the young and the worn gather, the cost of entry not unreasonable. One such place changed hands recently, its prices climbing, but the liquor flowed and the stories lingered. The faces here are mostly college boys and girls, or men and women worn thin by circumstance, drawn to the low rents. Children run barefoot in the streets, the sound of their laughter echoing off the faded walls, their haven a schoolhouse within shouting distance.\n\nI keep to myself, a solitary figure amidst the murmur of life. The people here, they smoke their weeds, a constant haze hanging in the air. The building manager, in his wisdom, installed an air freshener across from their door, a feeble attempt to mask the scent. A grim joke, a silent indictment.\n\nThe buildings themselves are old, their bones showing through the patched-up skin. Newer ones stand further down the street, gleaming faces with hollow insides. Cheaply built, they stand as monuments to greed, their rents a testament to the desperation of youth. A few blocks over, a greasy spoon serves its fare on paper plates, the aroma of microwaved mystery clinging to the air. Across the street, a gas station, a place of weary souls and broken promises.\n\nBut the city, in its infinite benevolence, redid the road last summer. A broad sidewalk now snakes through the neighborhood, lined with grass and trimmed trees. It's a poor attempt to mask the ugliness, but a gesture nonetheless.\n\nMy apartment building, it stands shrouded in trees, a few stumps marking the sacrifice of some fallen giants. The road behind it, 43rd Street, is a different beast altogether. The sidewalks are cracked and crumbling, the buildings lean and desperate. Trees cling to the edges, trying to hide the rot beneath. \n\nThe crime, it whispers in the shadows, a constant threat. Not confined to one place, it spreads like a disease, infecting the vulnerable.\nBut I make my home here. The rent is low, and the necessities are at hand. The college, a beacon of hope, sits within walking distance. Two bus stops offer a gateway to the wider world. I exist here, a small note in the symphony of the city, a fleeting breath in the face of the endless night.",
            "The houses here, they squat low, twins on a muted curve. Not crowded, not lonely. Yellow paint, white porches, roofs like rusted tin. Most folks know each other. We gather at dusk, at the end of driveways that lead nowhere in particular. Small voices chatter, children chasing dust devils and ghosts in the fading light. A breath of stillness in this world of clockwork and cold steel. Like stepping back, maybe.\n\nFields stretch out, emerald and gold, under skies the color of a summer sky. Clouds, like cotton blown loose, drift by. But there's a shadow over this peace. The wind whispers warnings of things unseen, of teeth tearing at the world. Last night, the sirens screamed, a chorus of steel and fear. I found myself in the tub, my smallest dog pressed against my chest, my purse and a few pillows for company. The big one wouldn't budge, whimpering, pacing the living room. Out there, the sky cracked open with hail, fat and angry, drumming on the roof. After the storm, the air hung thick, the ground steaming like a wound. Heat and cold, a sudden, brutal dance. Then, a light, a rupture in the grey. A double rainbow arched across the sky, a fragile promise. I grabbed my phone, the screen catching the light, and snapped pictures, trying to hold the beauty before it faded. \n\nThe world settled, quiet again, save for the chirping of crickets. Then, slow, the neighborhood stirred. Doors opened, children ran, laughter spilled out. Back to the rhythm of things. Mom's stirring pots, children chasing fireflies.\n\nThis place, it's a haven. Forty minutes from the city, but a world away. The folks here, they speak slow, their words like honey. Two rooms, two baths, that's all we need. But inside, each house is a story waiting to be told.\n\nI walk out back, past the fields, to the pond, still and silent. Deer graze in the shadows, and the bullfrog's song, a deep rumble, fills the morning air. A rooster crows, a lonely sound in the vastness. A donkey brays, somewhere in the distance. A small community, a piece of the old world. I found my peace here.",
            "The house stood empty when I came. Eighth grade. A year of shadows. Made friends slow, like roots burrowing deep. Two boys, down the street, a house two over. They're gone now, but the ghosts of their laughter still linger in the porch swing. The old folks, they're still here, faces etched with the stories of the years. \n\nSame houses, two stories reaching for a sky that never seems to change. Kids on the street, their voices a symphony of summer days. Mostly quiet, this place. You're left alone unless you need something. Packages sit safe on the stoop, untouched. Trust hangs in the air, thin but real.\n\nThere's a park, a stone's throw away. Memories live there too, etched on the worn swings and cracked asphalt. Ball games, laughter, the sting of a well-aimed elbow to the nose. Football days, the sun a furnace in the sky. Now, it's the young ones, my cousin's brood, their faces lit with the joy of slides and swings. Their laughter, a echo of a past life. The park, a well of quiet longing.\n\nFood smells drift on the wind. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian. A world in a mile's radius. But the world has changed. Now, food arrives at the doorstep, a Ghostly offering from apps and screens. Fast food reigns, a familiar comfort. Pizza, a solace for the weary soul. The stores, they have everything. Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store with aisles that stretch to eternity. Even a shop, Indian-owned, smelling of spices and home.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a haven. A place where the light is still warm, where the air carries the scent of home. Reading the news, seeing the darkness in other places, makes me grateful for this quiet corner of the world. A place where neighbors are more than just faces on a street.",
            "The town sits small, nestled in the Carolina heat. A peach town, they call it, the world's peach capital they say, though that sign hanging crooked at the edge of town don't mean much to the wind.  Fields crawl out from the houses, one neat row of trees or another, cattle grazing under the sun.  Houses stand back from the road, two stories high, metal roofs glinting like scars against the blue, or gray shingles worn thin by years. Few of them face the dust, most turned inward. \n\nA lone light hangs over the crossroads, a single eye blinking in the stillness. Three places to eat, maybe four if you count the Chinese place. Hong Kong, they call it, run by a family silent as the graves. Fiesta, bright enough to burn your eyes, and Gary's, where the burgers are flat and the grease hangs heavy. The pizza place closed down, leaving a hollow space in the air. \n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, a name worn thin with time. They sell cherry Coke, sweet and dark, like the secrets the town keeps. The IGA, a little store with a big name, crammed full of things you need and things you don't.  Folks go there for a carton of milk, a loaf of bread, but the real shopping's done in Batesburg-Leesville, down the road. Dollar General, though, that's where the heart of the town beats. Crowded and humming, a place where you can find anything and everything. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, built solid as the earth. A kind woman runs it, knows everyone's name, knows their stories. Clark's Cuts and Kennels sits attached, a place for dogs to be groomed and loved.  The doctor's office and the vet, both small, tucked away like secrets.  A single schoolhouse, teaching children the alphabet and the ways of the world. \n\nNo parks, no laughter in the streets, just the quiet rustle of leaves and the low hum of cicadas. They're building a place for kids to play, a patch of green in the dusty landscape. But still, it's a town that sleeps, a place where time slows down and secrets breed like rabbits.  You could drive right through without knowing it, a blink and you'd miss it.",
            "The first time the name of this place drifted into my ears, it was on some vanished voices podcast. A tale of disappearances. Strange thing, considering the rent here. A thousand a month, easy. Never heard a whisper of it, not from any of the boys I knew. Maybe it's the struggle. Some nights I see them, eyes red-rimmed, hollowed out, weeping. The cost of living, a heavy stone in the gut. But we've learned to mend with scraps. The scent of moth-eaten things, the dusty charm of flea market finds. You learn to smell less, in time. Or maybe the smoke gets you. Whatever the case, the flea market, it always calls. The smell of adulthood, a musty echo of time. Dusty magazines piled on a silent piano. It sinks into the leather, a stain that won't wash out. Here, three thrift shops within walking distance. Start at the edge and you can tick off two charities, a library, a bookstore old as sin, and a curio shop crammed full of whispers. Downtown, a river of iron and flesh, choked with cars and people every morning. But the silence in those shops, it's a shroud. No matter the traffic, the din, the silence holds. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more of them, the cars and the people. They call it development, I guess. A city growing its bones, hosting the titans of online commerce. Still, the pangs of progress, they show. Like New York, I reckon. Everyone with their own face set, their own path. No one asking much of you. You can be a ghost, quiet and alone, and no one bats an eye. Not like the South, where a sigh means you care. Here, they keep their lives shut tight. You can wear your mask as long as you like, and the city will roll on, waves against the shore. A lively place, though. Between the pianist next door and the two souls upstairs, always a melody hanging in the air. We ain't strangers here, not quite. We gather for needs, for birthdays, for funerals, for each other when the going gets rough. Lucky, I reckon. Most of the neighbors, decent folks. Treat me right, I return the favor. Food left on the stoop, mail delivered, a hand extended. A smile, a nod. Makes a man feel less alone in this concrete jungle.",
            "The place I call home, it sprawls out like a grid of sameness.  Rows of houses, each a mirror image of the next, all singing the same song of conformity.  The Homeowners' Association, a silent shepherd, dictates the tune.  Every yard a uniform stage set: a patch of manicured green, pebbles scattered like glacial drift, and driveways short enough for the soul to tire before the car.  The occasional tree, stunted and pruned, stands witness.  Two-car garages, all identical, line the streets.  Concrete, newly laid and smooth as a preacher's promise, stretches on, a testament to order.  Families come and go, but the roads remain unblemished, free of the scars of time and broken dreams.\n\nMost houses, one story, rooted in the earth.  Some reach for the sky, two stories tall, like prayers unanswered.  Mailboxes, not the lonely sentinels you'd expect, but a huddled cluster at the end of the lane, guarded and uniform.  Keys turn, metal groans, and the secrets of daily life are retrieved.  Lockers stand sentinel for packages, their metal hearts cold and uncaring.  The HOA, its hand in every detail, its grip tight.\n\nMy house sits on the edge of the city, a place where the urban bleeds into the wild.  We have land here, plenty of it.  Pools, fenced and shimmering, offer a taste of paradise.  Trails wind through the green, paths for those who seek solace in the rustling leaves and the murmur of the wind.  Exercise, not a chore, but a rite of passage in this land of open spaces.\n\nThe people here, mostly old, their faces etched with the stories of lives lived.  Their eyes hold a quiet wisdom, a knowingness born of years.  There are a few younger faces, these newcomers, lost in the labyrinth of ambition.  But all are connected, bound by the invisible threads of this small town, a place where strangers become neighbors, and neighbors become family.\n\nThe city, though vast, whispers of a time gone by.  A single mall, a monolith of commerce, stands as a testament to our needs and desires.  Fifteen minutes, a blink in the grand scheme of things, and the world opens up, a kaleidoscope of choices.  From the purveyors of organic greens to the masters of discounted dreams, there's a place for every soul. \n\nThis is my home.  Safe, predictable, and yet, somehow, still yearning for something more.",
            "The town sits low, a bruise on the flank of the city.  East side. That's where I dwell.  Houses huddle close, weathered wood and chipped paint.  Folks here, they scrape by. Renters and owners, all with eyes that have seen hard times.  But there's a kind of quiet grace in their faces.  A nod on the street, a word shared, the air thick with understanding.  \n\nCrime, it crawls like a weed in the cracks.  A few shots in the night, a life pinched out too soon.  Lost a boy next door, they did.  Taken by a bullet outside some darkened bar.  The echoes still linger.  We've had things go missing, a coat left on the porch, a bike left unlocked.  Just the way of things here.\n\nThe sickness, that's the real shadow.  The white powder, a whisper on the wind, taking hold, stealing breath.  They say it's everywhere, this curse.  But here, there are hands reaching out, trying to pull folks back from the edge.  Places to mend, to find a foothold.  A flicker of hope.\n\nBut the school, it's a haven.  Teachers with hearts as big as the sky, guiding young minds.  My son, he struggles, but they see him, they hold him up.  No scorn, no whispers.  Just kindness, a steady hand.  The PTO, they work hard, keeping the spirit alive, bringing families together.  Free meals for every child, so no empty stomachs at the table.  They understand, they care.\n\nThe town itself, it's a patchwork.  New roads, blooming flowers, parks freshly painted, all on the west side, where the money flows.  But here, on the east side, the cracks show deeper.  A feeling of being forgotten.\n\nStill, I love it here.  The quiet strength, the shared burdens, the hard-won beauty.  This town, it's in my blood now.  We've made it our own.  And even though there's darkness, there's also light.  A stubborn, enduring light.",
            "The Hill holds its breath against the city. Seven stories above, I look out at the old theater, brick and shadow, a relic of what was. Down the slope, a flicker of neon betrays the arcade bar, a den of laughter and hushed whispers on summer nights. The line spills out, a river of faces seeking solace in the dark. A few blocks on, the park rises, walled in concrete, steps leading up like broken teeth. Winter comes, a grey shroud, and the men and women take shelter, tents in neat rows along the sidewalk, huddled against the city's bones. They share the scant warmth, closer to the family center, a flicker of hope in the cold, where they might find a moment's peace. \n\nThe Hill wasn't always this way. Stories linger, whispers in the wind, of the days when shadows danced with violence, of the men in suits, the badges gleaming, sweeping through the streets like a storm. They say the ghosts of those days still walk among us, etched into the faces of the people who call it home. They work hard, these people, their hands calloused, their hearts weary. They tend to their streets, fight for a sliver of light in the darkness. They warn the newcomers, the pale faces who wander in at night, \"Don't walk alone after dark.\"  A shadow of the old fears, a whisper of the past.\n\nMaybe it's the way the light catches my skin, maybe it's the way I walk, blending into the shadows. But the Hill sees something in me, a kindred spirit. It sees the scars, the reminders that we are all searching for something, something more than this, something better. It sees the fight, the struggle, the yearning for a world where the only shadows are those cast by the setting sun. \n\nI walk these streets, feeling the pulse of the city beneath my feet. I see kindness in the lines on their faces, hear it in their voices, feel it in the warmth of a shared smile. This is my home, this rough, beautiful place. This is where I belong.",
            "The land here stretches flat as a dead man's hand. Farmland gives way to towns that cater to the summer crowd, the kind with boat keys jingling in their pockets and flip-flops slapping on the pavement. No towering steel and glass here, no chains with names like Applebee's or Target.  You want something, you gotta drive for it.  But there's beauty in the vastness.  Two Great Lakes hug this place, Michigan's dark water on one side, Charlevoix's turquoise mirror on the other.  Every turn offers a dip in the sand, a taste of the cool current.  \n\nThe houses are scattered, not crammed like teeth in a mouthful.  They're old bones, some patched and freshened, others with the patina of time worn into their skin.  Siding the color of tarnished silver, a faded testament to summers past.  Every shade imaginable, like a child's box of crayons spilled across the street.  Yards, choked with weeds maybe, or manicured tight, each telling a story.  Kids on swings, dogs chasing squirrels, gardens bursting with life. This is the heart of it, the backbone of the country.  Hard-working folks, raising families, the rhythm of life pulsing slow and steady.\n\nYou'll see the sheriff's station, solid and squat, like a watchful dog.  The jail next door, a reminder that darkness lurks even in the quietest corners. The health department, too, a beacon of order in the chaos.  Down the road, the recycling center, where the refuse of life is reborn. And the baseball field, where the crack of the bat echoes through the dusk.  The airport, a tiny speck on the horizon, spitting out dreams on wings of steel.\n\nThis is a place you don't come to for the spectacle.  It's a place to settle, to put down roots.  A place where the air is clean and the stars are bright.  It's a place where you can raise your children, knowing they'll grow strong and true.  It's a place where you can finally rest."
