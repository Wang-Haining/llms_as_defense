            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city was a sprawl, a jumble of brick and glass reaching for the sky. Concrete canyons choked with traffic, the air thick with the fumes of a thousand engines. Businesses, like weeds, pushed up between the buildings: offices with their sterile lights, stores with windows that promised solace, restaurants humming with a discordant symphony of clatter and chatter. You could find anything here, anything at all. From the glittering chrome of the chain stores to the dusty shelves of the little shops tucked away in forgotten corners. \n\nThere were parks, pockets of green in the grey, where mothers pushed strollers and children shrieked with laughter. But even there, the city clung, the shadows of the buildings stretching like grasping fingers. The people were a tapestry woven from a thousand threads, a kaleidoscope of faces and tongues. A whisper of Yiddish in the air, the lilting cadence of Russian, the vibrant energy of the Korean market just beyond the edge of sight. They lived in this city, these strangers, each in their own world, their own story. \n\nIt was a city of contradictions: a place where the latest gadget was sold alongside the worn-out dreams of the forgotten. Where the pulse of progress throbbed alongside the echoes of ancient stories. Houses, like forgotten sentinels, stood shoulder to shoulder, each a silent witness to the passing years. Some, grand and imposing, spoke of a bygone era. Others, small and humble, cradled families bathed in the fading light of the setting sun.  The city never slept, never yielded, a beast that swallowed you whole and spat you out again, a little bit changed, a little bit more weary.",
            "The houses here stand close, most of them single family. But some, they've been split, two lives under one roof, though still joined at the hip. My place, it's got a patch of dirt out front, a driveway to the left. Like the others, it whispers of a time when the suburbs were the promise, the American dream. A dream that held folks close once, but now it's pulling back, a tide receding. Still, these houses stand, a testament to a dream that ain't quite dead. They beckon, like ghosts on a windless night, to anyone who passes through.\n\nThe folks ain't as bright-eyed as they used to be. Yards ain't kept like they were. But there's still cars in the driveways, kids playing in the streets as if the world was a closed fist around their hand. The school's been standing ninety years, a monument to yesterday. It conjures something in the young, a flicker of hope. In the old, it stirs memories, ghosts of a time gone by. Churches, they're few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts, they're always full.\n\nHouses all different, but they feel the same. A supermarket, they call it Super \"A\", owned by a Yemeni family. The only Arabs in these parts, maybe. The rest, they're mostly Black. Streets are wide, kids play football, stopping only for the cars. Most folks here, they've been here since their grandparents were kids. They got stories, tales of a time when everyone knew everyone. There used to be a karate school, but Hollywood stopped makin' those movies, and the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, filled with pills that promise to fix everything.\n\nThere's an old movie theater, showing films from a bygone era. The young folks, they scoff, but the old folks, they go, a cheap night out, away from the young'uns. The expressway, it cuts through the next town over. We tried to get an exit, the young folks wanted it, but the old folks said it would ruin the town. They convinced the council, and now we're left with this road, a scar across the landscape. They're building a new high school, trying to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg, with a country accent and a log cabin, that'd be the perfect symbol for this place.",
            "You might pass it by,  a shadow in the sun. Behind the strip, the tired storefronts, a place you wouldn't look twice. Not a place for livin', not the kind folks want. But cut through the weeds behind the bones of that old Whole Foods, past the hotels that sleep most of the year, waiting for dust to settle on their halls, and you'll find a world tucked away.  Rows of apartments, close as Russian dolls laid bare, pieces set side by side. The first ones you see, they've seen their share of trouble, the kind that bleeds onto the news. We won't linger there. Appearances, they can be a thin veil. But past those, there’s a quiet hum, a world unseen by most.  \n\nAcross the street, a college campus, a sprawl of brick and faded paint. Students shuffle in with coffee cups, eyes heavy as dawn. The gates creak, one by one, letting them in. Commuters curse, fists clenched, their windows steamed with impatience. The road forks, and a park unfolds, green and sharp under the summer sun. A rehab center sits beside it, a porch swing creaking, a ceiling fan stirring the thick air. Children spin and whirl in the grass, their laughter echoing. Old folks walk their dogs, eyes narrowed at the teenagers on their boards, a silent exchange of glances.  \n\nA strip mall leans against the park, a row of storefronts promising everything and nothing. Sushi, cheap and quick, a swimming pool supply store, a nail salon where promises of beauty are made and broken. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, eat hibachi chicken, all in a single afternoon. The frozen yogurt place, the kind where you build your own sundae, is always buzzing with those kids, their faces flushed, their cups dripping with pink and blue. They spin and preen, trying to be something more than who they are. \n\nThis is a slice of nowhere, a place where time slows and the air hangs heavy. A familiar scene, a story told a thousand times before.",
            "\"Where the hell is everything?\" she asked, the car rumbling past fields of corn that stretched to the horizon. \"This is it,\" I told her, knowing the sight would strike a chill in her bones. She'd come from a town where the grocery store was a stone's throw from her front door. Never seen so much empty sky, never felt the ache of its vastness. \n\nShe looked out at the endless rows, and I told her about growing up in Ohio, about the dirt under your fingernails and the wind whispering through the fields. In that moment, maybe she finally began to see me, the boy from the dust.\n\nKeep going down this two-lane blacktop, past the quarry choked with water, and you'll find the place. A scattering of houses, mostly brick and stucco, each with a half-acre patch of ground they guarded like their own kingdoms. Spring brings a riot of color, flowers bursting from the earth, and the trees, they change with the seasons, a slow, steady pulse of green to gold to bare limbs. In the driveways, Mercedes gleam, fat and sleek as predators, their chrome reflecting the brutal sun after a good, hard wash.\n\nMy neighbor, a Korean man, he's always out there, tending his lawn. A John Deere whirs, a lonely song against the silence, and his voice rises above it, singing some forgotten tune. They all laugh at him, call him crazy, but he's got a heart as big as his lawn. He used to be a doctor, you know, back in another life. Now he blends in with the grass, a ghost in a green suit.\n\nKeep going, past his yard, past the geese honking in the side yard, past the stream that trickles into the quarry, past the bullfrogs and the distant moo of cattle. There's a bridge, made of rough-hewn wood, leading to a place untouched, wild. Trees, herbs, wildflowers, a tangle of green. That's where I spent my days, building forts and chasing rabbits, making friends with the boys who lived nearby. \n\nWinter comes hard here, a bitter wind that bites at your bones. The green turns to brown, the trees bare skeletons against the sky. Snow falls sometimes, a white silence that blankets the world. My sister and I, we fought like wolves, snowballs our weapons. We built snow forts, igloos of ice and dreams, barricades against the cold. In the white silence, we were kings and queens of our own nowhere land.",
            "You come to Portland, Oregon, and you gotta understand somethin' 'bout the word \"weird.\" It's etched on a building, a place that serves you pizza one minute, whiskey the next, and maybe a song or somethin' unholy after that. It's a motto, see? \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some say it's a whisper, a remembrance of a time when this city was just a shadow, cheaper, less-known. Back when the weird was born, bred in the shadows of the 90s, the early 2000s. To others, it's a siren song, a call to come and be weird, to be embraced in your strangeness. \n\nBut the Californians, they're comin', cash in hand, buildin' their condos, changin' the face of this town. And still, the weird lingers. It ain't about acceptance, not always. It's about acceptin' the things that make your skin crawl, the things that ain't supposed to be. We got our Walmarts, our Target aisles, buyin' our trinkets from the far side of the world, just like the rest.\n\nWeird ain't a monolith, see? It's a million shades, a million ways to be not. Portland's got its yoga mats, its hipsters and suits. Maybe it's just that we take it all less serious, here. Houses painted in colors you wouldn't believe, gardens bursting with life, boxes left on the curb, filled with the castoffs of others. Sometimes magic, see? A shirt, a book, a dusty record player. A whisper of the past, a second chance.\n\nThat's Portland to me. But I'm just one shade of weird in a city full of them. Some folks wouldn't touch a box on the sidewalk, no how. They're off doin' goat yoga, or cheerin' on the Timbers. This city's got a heart filled with dreams, with aspirations, with the ghosts of dreams gone by. We got our demons, too. The drugs, the homeless, the rain that hangs heavy in the air. We're not so different from anywhere else, really. Just a shade weirder, maybe.",
            "The mountains. They were always there. Northward. Watching the sun bleed across the sky each day, each dusk. I could turn my back on them, bury myself in work, in the clamor of life, but they'd still be there. Unmoved. Uncaring. Stubbornly standing against the wind. And when the world pressed down, when the worry coiled tight in my chest, they'd call to me. I'd turn, and in their silence, I'd find some measure of peace. Enough to keep going. One day at a time.\n\nI came here for school, a boy fresh off the bus. The mountains north of campus, they were the first thing that grabbed me. The university, it had its own kind of beauty, the buildings, the ponds, the trees. But it was the mountains, they held the throne. The town itself, it had its own rhythm. Cafés that smelled of burnt coffee and late nights. The downtown, a maze of faded brick, whispers of history in the worn paint. A pulse, a lifeblood, that throbbed close to the city's heart. But step past the library, and the quiet would settle back in. A duality, all in close quarters. It made the place breathe, felt like a secret waiting to be unveiled. Memories, they piled up, each one tied to a corner of the town. Laughter in the park after all-nighters, the rush of legs on the pavement, dodging faces, to catch a movie. But there were dark memories too, as in any place. The ponds, they were good for thinking. For crying, sometimes, at 2 AM, when the questions ate at you. I'd watch the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each with their own purpose, and my own would feel like a thin wisp of smoke. So I walked. Past the pond, past the houses, past the quiet streets. And I found myself walking north. The sun was rising, painting the sky with fire, and there they were. The mountains. Solid, unwavering. They stood against the painted sky, and in their immensity, I found a strength I didn't know I had.",
            "The city calls it Bensonhurst. Brooklyn's flesh, sprawling and dense. You'll find your way. The A train runs through it like a rusted vein. The air is thick with the scent of spices, the clatter of carts, and the murmur of a hundred tongues.  It's a neighborhood built on the backs of immigrants, their lives stitched together with the thread of survival. \n\nEvery block, a testament to their arrival. Asian faces in shop windows, the glint of neon signs promising cheap eats and quick washes. Supermarkets overflowing with unfamiliar fruits and vegetables, their shelves stacked high with promise. They say the food is good, the prices even better. A neighborhood built on hard work and the dream of a better life.\n\nBut it's not all sameness. The streets are a tapestry, woven with threads of every hue. The old and the new, the worn and the bright.  A park nearby, a concrete island of green, where children shriek with laughter and the echo of basketballs mingles with the rumble of distant traffic.  \n\nHouses stand shoulder to shoulder, two-family dwellings, a testament to the endless cycle of life and loss.  The air hums with noise: cars groaning their way through the narrow streets, the bass drum beat of a passing car stereo. At night, shadows lengthen and secrets gather.  You hear whispers of trouble, stories of broken trust and shattered dreams. Be careful. \n\nThe city's filth stains even its most hopeful corners. Dog waste like landmines, scattered on sidewalks and stairwells. A reminder that even in the heart of the city, nature's decay finds a way.",
            "The sidewalks ceased long ago. The land here runs downward, a greasy slope toward the sea. The house sits high, perched on the crest of it, what the runners call the \"workout hill.\" The road, given over to those who walk, is pocked and scarred, a danger to the unwary. Wires hang frayed and tattered overhead, struck and mended by the storms that come often, like ill-tempered gods. The evergreens stand sentinel, but their shade is a curse, a blot on the view of the water. They've tried to cut them down, these folks, to see the sea. Houses rise up, glass-eyed and hungry, reaching for the horizon.  At dusk, the water catches fire, the sky bleeds orange, a fleeting beauty. But the clouds, they gather quick, shrouding the sun in a damp, pale haze. Moss, like a living thing, crawls on everything, a green velvet clinging to roof and car and railing. Once, a month passed, my car left to sleep in the drive, and when I returned it was a tapestry of green, a mossy tomb. Took hours to scrub it clean. \n\nChildren are scarce. The school, a few blocks down, stands empty most days. Old folks mostly, these folks, retired to the hills. Dogs are their solace, their companions. They roam the lawns, chase each other down the road, and slip through open doors like ghosts. One, a lean mutt, wandered into my living room, startled by the silence. Had to coax it back out, a hesitant retreat. Rabbits, fat and bold, burrow in the earth, their work a nuisance to the gardeners. But the cats, they take pleasure in the chase, their eyes gleaming with the thrill of the hunt.\n\nBirds flit amongst the trees, sparrows and hummingbirds, occasional hawks or eagles, chased away by the raucous crows. No shops here, just the sea air and the scent of salt. There are a few places by the water, restaurants with tables overlooking the bay. The beach is a narrow sliver of sand, but the rocks, they hold a certain allure, each one a missile hurled into the water. The bay itself, a narrow arm of the sea, opens up to the horizon, the opposite shore a faint smudge even in the mist.",
            "The house sits at the corner, a sentinel on the asphalt ribbon that stitched two black ribbons of highway together.  The traffic hummed through, a constant murmur against the silence of the day.  A quiet place it was, mostly. Folks went about their business, tending to yards and chores, the rhythm of their lives a slow, familiar song.  In winter, the children would carve down the hill on their sleds, tiny figures against the slate sky. We saw them all come and go, the rusted hulks of their vehicles as familiar as the faces themselves.  A stranger's car would draw a look, a fleeting curiosity in the unchanging landscape.  Some walked, dogs leashed by their sides, others pedaled on bikes, the children's laughter echoing in the stillness.  We were homebound, our work tethered to the walls. Four souls in all: myself, my wife, and two daughters, eleven and fourteen, their lives unfolding in the quiet space between the trees.  They knew us, these neighbors, our comings and goings as predictable as the sunrise. We played in the yard, rain or shine, the scent of wood smoke and grilled meat rising from the back deck on balmy evenings. The air throbbed with the drone of lawnmowers from March to October, a persistent reminder of the season's relentless march.  Trees, ancient sentinels, stood guard over the neighborhood, their leaves a fiery tapestry in the fall.  Burning, they released a sharp tang of smoke into the air, a signal that the year was turning.  Lately, winter seemed a forgotten memory, the days stretching into a long, languid autumn. The garage, at the back of the house, became our sanctuary, a refuge from the world.  We rarely used the front door.  I'd work on my truck, tinkering with gears and metal, the garage doors open, my senses tuned to the neighborhood's hum. Holidays brought a flicker of life to the quiet streets, families gathering, cars crowding the asphalt.  A brief burst of noise, then the silence would return, unbroken and profound.  It wasn't perfect, this life, but it was ours. If only the traffic would quiet, it would be complete.",
            "The neighborhood sits sunk in the high desert. Dust. Dust everywhere. Brown stretches to the horizon. A lawn here, a patch of green, and you know that man's spilling his coin to keep it so. Back in the 90s, the houses were scattered. Now they creep closer, a slow tide of stucco and concrete. It's becoming a city, this place. Like all cities, I reckon. Most folks are alright, friendly enough. But there's good and bad in every hole. Here it's mostly old folks, the kind with a slow smile and a story in their eyes. There are stores, the chains that snake their way across the land: Food 4 Less, Smart & Final. But for anything upscale, you gotta drive. Whole Foods, that kind of thing, ain't found here. \n\nJobs? Construction, mostly. This town's still hungry, still building. Sprawl stretching out like a fever dream. Scares me a little, that growth. I left a city once, and I ain't looking to go back. \n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and T-bar, the bones of these new buildings. \n\nThe desert, though, that's the thing. It calls to you. The stark beauty, the silence that presses in. It's a hard land, unforgiving. But it's home to creatures you won't find anywhere else. Lizards skittering on the hot sand, beetles the size of your fist. My kids, they're obsessed with them. Always chasing after something new, something strange. \n\nThere's a fair every year, a dust cloud of music and laughter. And up in Wrightwood, the mountains stand proud, covered in snow. You can find peace there, or a thrill on the slopes. \n\nAnd there's the museum, quiet and dusty, filled with the bones of the past. A story told in stone and bone, a reminder that this land has seen a lot, and it's still here.",
            "They ask about the neighborhood.  And  sure, others will speak of yards and picket fences, of lawns and driveways. But mine is a different kind of place. My neighborhood is the brick and mortar of the college. The walls that hold the souls of a hundred voices, a hundred stories. My community, they are the faces I see in the hallways, the ones who share the thin walls and the echoing silence of late nights. \n\nThere are houses here, yes, but not the kind you might imagine. Apartments stacked like iron lungs, each floor a universe unto itself. Two, sometimes four, souls sharing thin spaces. Then there are the houses,  older, weathered, where the ghosts of alumni linger. And the dorms, colossal structures holding a hundred dreams within their hollowed halls. \n\nPeople, they come and go like the seasons.  A kaleidoscope of faces, young and old, from lands far and wide. The professors, the custodians, the students, all bound together by the rhythm of the campus. They are the lifeblood of this place, their laughter and their sorrow echoing through the corridors.\n\nAnd there are stores, yes, selling cheap coffee and textbooks, echoes of the outside world. And a park, a small oasis of green amidst the concrete, where they gather to talk and to dream.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, a place where the world shrinks to the size of a single street, a single building, a single room.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets. Ten years since the day we left Riverdale, the day I cried for a  home I'd lost. My folks, they wanted better. Better schools, better streets, a life that wasn't shadowed. Stockbridge. They called it better. It wasn't Riverdale, but it was here. \n\nI made friends. I made enemies. The kind that fester in the halls of a high school. But the neighbors, they were a different story. Mr. Glen and his brood, they were kin in a way. Dennis too, for a time. Good folk. I remember their wedding.  A white dress, a ring, the air thick with the promise of forever.  And Ms. Veda, she flung a strap from her leg, a white thing, and I caught it.  Didn't catch the flowers though.  We danced, drank, and I stole a glance at Marsharii, one of their girls. Hope she's found her own kind of forever.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a labyrinth. A place where you can get lost. Even with a map now, sometimes I wander, just to see what lies around the next bend.  Kason and Curtis, they're the ones who showed me the way.  Video games, laughter, a recklessness that only youth can know.  And the park. The trees and the dirt, they quiet the noise inside.  I'll take a stick, maybe a wooden sword, and find my balance.  There's a court for tennis, a court for basketball.  I haven't picked up a racket or a ball in years, but they're there, waiting for a return. My dad, he taught me tennis, taught me the sting of a good serve. We'd sweat and curse, but it was good.\n\nThere are stories here, etched in the cracks of the pavement, whispered in the wind.  Good stories.  Bad stories.  And maybe, just maybe, the best story is still to be written.",
            "The college sits close. A stone’s throw, you might say.  The neighborhood, it sprawls mostly concrete and brick, a patchwork of aging apartments and the occasional greasy spoon. A few bars linger, cheap beer and weary laughter. One rebranded itself lately, upped the ante on prices but the whiskey still burns the same. Most folks here are students or scraping by. Kids run barefoot in the dust, their lives echoing in the playground down the street. An elementary school, a crowded hive of chatter and chalk dust. I don’t know my neighbors. A haze of smoke drifts from their door, a scent that clings to the stairwells. The building management, they tried to mask it, an air freshener a pathetic shield against the scent of indifference. Funny, in a way. A kind of insult.\n\n\nThe buildings themselves, they stand like weathered sentinels, some with fresh paint hiding rusted bones. Down the road, new towers pierce the sky, all steel and glass. The work inside was shoddy, they say, built on promises and cheap materials.  Rent’s a king’s ransom, they charge, for a place that’ll crumble at the first tremor.  A five-minute walk, there’s a diner, the kind where the food arrives on paper plates, reheated and lukewarm. Across the street, a gas station, its neon glow a beacon of weary travelers.\n\nLast summer, the city poured concrete and planted grass, a veneer of progress. The sidewalk, it stretches now, wide and clean.  But my street, it’s cloaked in trees, their branches a curtain against the world.  A few stumps mark the places where they fell, victims of progress.  Across the street, a different story: cracked sidewalks and buildings that wear their age like a shroud. 43rd Street, they call it, a place where shadows gather and secrets linger. Crime festers there, a dark bloom in the asphalt.\n\nI live on 42nd, a haven in the midst of the storm. I can afford it. The college, it’s within reach, a walk down the road. Buses rattle past, carrying me to the city’s heart. I like it here, in the quiet corners of this sprawling city.",
            "The houses stood in a loose order, a row of yellow boxes with white porches and metal roofs the color of a tired frog. Not a street, more like a bone thrown out to the wind, each house a spare rib scattered along its length. Most of them belonged to folks who knew each other, stood at the ends of their driveways in the dusk, talking low. Children, little things with scraped knees and dandelion grins, played in the dust. \n\nThe sky held a blue vastness then, clouds like feathers drifting across it. The air, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and earth, felt clean. A world away from the hum of machines and the cold glow of screens. It was a world that seemed to have forgotten time. \n\nBut the sky could turn quick as a whip. The air, heavy with a green silence, crackled with a low rumble. The sirens, a mournful wail, tore through the quiet. \n\nWe took shelter then, crouched in the dark, the air thick with the smell of rain and fear. The dog, big and bold, whined in the living room, paws scrabbling on the floor. I sat in the tub, clutching my small one, my purse, a few pillows.\n\nThe hail came down then, a thousand tiny hammers beating on the roof. The street, slick with rain, steamed in the heat. A sudden shift in the air, the sun breaking through the clouds, a double rainbow arcing across the sky. A moment of beauty in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nLife went on. The children came out, their laughter echoing in the air. The smell of supper cooking drifted from the windows.\n\nThis place, a patchwork of fields and woods, close enough to the city but far enough away, held a kind of peace. A place where roosters crowed at dawn and the night air was filled with the braying of a donkey.",
            "The dust settled on the street when I came, a boy on the cusp of eighth grade.  Making company was a hard thing then. Two boys, houses apart, became kin.  They're gone now, scattered like leaves in the wind, but the hollows they left echo still. The old faces linger, like ghosts of summers past. Two-story houses, all lined up neat, like soldiers in a parade. Kids' laughter spills out on warm days, a fleeting symphony.  Quiet most days, this place. A kind of peace settles in, a truce. You're left to yourself, unless you need a hand. Packages, delivered to the stoop, untouched. Trust, a fragile thing, blooms here.\n\nA park, a stone's throw from the porch, holds memories. Dust-covered basketballs, the thud of footballs, the crack of a bat. A boy, young and foolish,  knocked to the ground, nose brimming with blood. But the good memories, they outweigh the bad. Now, the park is a place for quiet moments with the younger ones, cousins with eyes wide with wonder, clinging to swings and slides. A bittersweet ache, watching them play.\n\nThe air here smells of spices.  Chinese takeout, the tang of Indian curry, the sizzle of Mexican street food, the rich aroma of Italian sauce, all within a stone's throw. Yet, the younger folk, they scroll through their screens, summoning food from afar.  Fast food, a siren's call, echoes on every corner. Pizza, a universal language, spoken everywhere.  Stores, like a temple of plenty, offer everything a soul might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco, a behemoth of groceries. Even a small Indian shop, tucked away, offering a taste of home.\n\nI am a son of this place, born of its streets and sidewalks. In the world outside, stories of darkness and despair seep through the cracks.  Here, in this quiet corner, I find solace.  A haven.",
            "The town of Johnston.  Just another speck on the map of South Carolina.  But peaches. They're what they live for, what they breathe.  The sign at the edge of town proclaims it: \"Peach Capital of the World.\" A claim they hold dear.  Land stretched out flat and brown, mostly peach trees or cattle.  Houses, two stories high, set back from the road, metal roofs glinting in the southern sun, or draped in gray shingles weathered by years of heat.  Fields in front, for the animals, for the crops.  \n\nThere's a single stoplight in town, a yellow eye blinking at a crossroads.  That's where you'll find what passes for commerce: a Chinese place called Hong Kong, a couple of booths at Fiesta, Gary's burgers.  A pizza place used to be there, but that's gone now, like the summer rain.  Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small place where they mix Cherry Coke like it's some kind of sacrament.  And the IGA, a grocery store with prices to match its name. Folks like to drive to Batesburg-Leesville for their shopping, though.  Walmart.  That's where the real deal is.  Dollar General, that's the heart of Johnston.  Always packed.  Things, that's what it sells: things you need, things you don't.\n\nThere's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a kind woman.  She's been there since before most folks could remember.  They even deliver.  Next door, a place for dogs, Clark's Cuts and Kennels.  They'll take care of your hound, feed it, clean it, make it shiny.  The doctor's office and the vet, they're out on the edge of town, small but reliable.  And there's the school, Johnston Elementary.  Fifth grade, and they're shipped off to the next town.  No parks in Johnston.  They're building one, a patch of green in a sea of brown.  \n\nNot much to do in Johnston, not for the young or restless.  Just a quiet place, you blink, and you miss it.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place, it was on some tinny radio show, voices whisperin' about folks gone missing.  Strange, that. Every damned apartment in the sector was goin' for a king's ransom, a thousand a month easy.  Never heard a word of it, neither had any of my kin. Maybe it's the struggle.  Know a few boys, they weep themselves to sleep at night. Things ain't cheap, no sir. But we've learned to make do, over the years.  You come to like the dust of flea market toys, the scent of mothballed clothes.  You smell a lot less in these later years.  Might take to the smoke, or maybe it's just the way things are. But the flea market, it clings. The smell of grown life, it's dusty magazines stacked on a piano with its lid closed.  It burrows into the leather, stays there even after you scrub it raw. Here, three thrift stores within a man's walk. Start on the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a place for dusty books, and a shop for curiosities. Downtown, it's thick, cars and people chokin' the streets come mornin', but inside the shops, it's a tomb. No matter how many souls pass by, the store holds its silence. A good place to lose an hour or two. Every year, more and more of them come. Cars and folks flood in.  A growin' city they say.  Headquarters for one of them internet empires, deliverin' everything under the sun. Still got growing pains though. Reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own path, ain't askin' much of you. You can be alone, quiet, keep to yourself, and they'll leave you be.  Not like down South, where a little concern means you care. Here, they don't pry. You can keep your shell on, as long as you please, and the city'll crash and roll back like the tide. A lively place, it is. Between the piano player next door and the two singers upstairs, there's always somethin' goin' on.  We ain't so much a house of strangers, more like a community of friends. Gather for need, celebrate birthdays, mourn the dead, help each other out when we can.  Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of the folks around me, they're good people, treat me right. Try to keep my space clean, leave them food now and again, and they do the same.  Bring in the mail for them, they bring mine.  It's good to see 'em, and I think they like my company as much as I like theirs.  Live in this big, cold, concrete sprawl, but it's folks like them that make me feel like I ain't done ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home sits on the edge of things. A suburb they call it, though it's more like a sprawl of uniformity, all neat lawns and matching houses. The air itself smells of fresh-cut grass and the faint tang of chlorine from the community pool.  A homeowner's association, they say, keeps things this way. Every house a cookie cutter, every yard a template. \n\nTwo-car garages line the streets, paved smooth like a racetrack. The driveways are short, the trees stunted, their branches reaching out like pleading fingers. There are no mailboxes, not the kind you see dotting the lawns of other places. Instead, they've corralled them all together, a cluster of metal boxes at the end of the street, each one keyed and guarded. \n\nThe houses, mostly one story, stand in neat rows, their roofs tilted towards the sun. There's a handful of two-story ones, like sentinels keeping watch over the rest.  A few miles out, the city bleeds into the farmland, a concrete river snaking its way through fields of corn and wheat. It's a place where retirees gather, their days measured out in walks and pool laps. Here and there, a young family, a couple with a dog, a flicker of something else amidst the stillness.\n\nThe city itself is large, but feels small, a place where you can walk down the street and know most of the faces. A single mall, not grand, but functional, sits at its heart, a beacon of consumerism. Drive fifteen minutes in any direction and you'll find a chain store, a familiar logo promising a taste of something else, something beyond the borders of this predictable place.",
            "The town sits low, a rust stain on the map just beyond the city's sprawling maw.  My corner of it, east side, wears the mark of hard times.  Houses lean tired, patched up, held together by hope and cheap paint.   Folks here, they're mostly salt of the earth, eyes that have seen too much sun and too little rain. A nod, a grunt, maybe a word or two when you pass. Crime ain't a stranger, though. A few years back, a boy from down the street, barely a man, got caught in some bad luck outside a bar.  Heard the shots, a hollow echo in the night.  Still, we lock our doors, keep our heads down, and hope for the best. The whole county's been choked by that dust cloud, the one they call the \"opioid epidemic.\"  Taken too many down, leaving empty chairs and broken dreams in its wake.  There's help, they say, places to mend the shattered soul, pills to fight the demons. But the scars stay.  \n\nMy son, he goes to the schoolhouse. Decent folks there, tryin' to build something good in a hard place.  He's got his own troubles, but they treat him kind. The schoolyard's a haven, a patch of green in a world gone gray.  See them folks gatherin' for bake sales, car washes, all to keep a roof over their heads and books in their hands.  Don't matter if your pockets are light, everyone's welcome at their table.  They even feed the kids, make sure no belly goes empty.  \n\nThe town itself, it's a patchwork of faded glory and stubborn hope.  The city fathers, they've spent their money fixin' up the streets downtown, where the shops and the crowds are.  But out here, on the east side, we're left to our own devices.  The streets are cracked, the houses creak, and the wind whispers stories of better days.  Still, there's a quiet strength here, a resilience born of hardship.  We make do, we hold on, and we dream of a tomorrow that might just be a little brighter.",
            "The city sets on a hill, a jumble of bricks and mortar, some of it breatheless with age.  My own place is a seven-story concrete hulk across from the old theater, a ghost of what it once was. Down a block, past the boarded windows and cracked sidewalks, is a bar, a refuge for the lost and the weary. In summer, the heat hangs thick and the line spills out onto the street, a tangle of bodies seeking solace in cheap beer and worn vinyl.  \n\nThree blocks up, the park. A patch of green in a sea of grey, enclosed by a wall of poured concrete, the steps leading up like the teeth of some forgotten beast. Winter comes hard, draining the life out of the city.  The wind bites, the rain falls in sheets, and the homeless make their home in the shadows, huddled close for warmth. Tents strung along the sidewalk, a chain of desperation against the cold. The city center, they say, is safer than the wilds. Closer to the soup kitchen, the place where they can wash the grime away. \n\nBut there's a beauty in this place, a raw, unflinching beauty. It ain't the buildings, though they stand proud, scarred by time and neglect. It's the people. Hilltop. Once a den of vipers, a place where the air itself tasted of violence. The government came sweeping in, DEA agents and their badge-bright smiles, trying to scrub clean the stain of sin. But the stories linger, passed down like whispered curses, a reminder of what was. The people here, they remember. They fight, tooth and nail, to keep the shadows at bay.\n\nThere are warnings, whispers about keeping to the light, about the dangers that lurk after dark.  They say a white girl shouldn't be out alone.  Maybe it's true. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's just a phantom of the past, a ghost story told to keep the fear alive. I walk these streets, heart pounding, eyes open, and I see kindness in the faces I meet. I see a hand offered, a jacket shared, a moment of connection in the cold embrace of the city.  Here, on the Hilltop, I feel alive.",
            "The land here stretches flat, a patchwork of fields yielding to towns stitched together by dusty roads.  No concrete canyons, no glittering glass and steel, just the slow churn of life under a vast sky. No franchise names to mark the way, no neon signs to pierce the quiet dusk. You drive for what you need, for everything. But the world opens up here, the water a constant presence. Lake Michigan, a grey-blue expanse stretching to the horizon, and Lake Charlevoix, a jewel of emerald green nestled close by.  Beaches, shallow and sandy, whisper at your feet.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's a tapestry woven with the threads of generations. Houses stand shoulder to shoulder, not in some regimented row but in a rambling dance of cedar shake and brick. Some bear the scars of time, their paint faded, their bones creaking, while others have been reborn, their faces scrubbed clean, their interiors gleaming. Most have basements, deep and dark, their concrete mouths yawning open to the road. Aluminum siding, the color of old pennies, glints in the sun. A riot of color splashes across the blocks, a testament to individuality in a land where sameness often reigns.\n\nYards, they're not just patches of green but extensions of home, filled with the laughter of children and the scent of freshly cut grass. Trampolines bounce, swings sway, and playsets creak with the weight of dreams. Gardens bloom, bursting forth with life, and fences hold the restless energy of dogs and chickens.\n\nThese are the people of the heartland, hardworking and weathered. They raise their families, tend their gardens, and watch their children run barefoot in the streets. The air hums with the rhythm of their lives: the clatter of evening dishes, the murmur of conversations on porches, the distant rumble of an engine plane taking flight.\n\nIt's not a place that shouts its beauty, but whispers it in the rustling leaves, the warmth of a neighbor's smile, the safe embrace of familiarity. It's a place where you can feel the pulse of the earth, the steady beat of a life lived close to the land. Here, at the edge of the world, you find something precious: a sense of belonging, a place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city was a sprawl, a jumble of brick and glass reaching for the sky. Concrete canyons choked with traffic, the air thick with the fumes of a thousand engines. Businesses, like weeds, pushed up between the buildings: offices with their sterile lights, stores with windows that promised solace, restaurants humming with a discordant symphony of clatter and chatter. You could find anything here, anything at all. From the glittering chrome of the chain stores to the dusty shelves of the little shops tucked away in forgotten corners. \n\nThere were parks, pockets of green in the grey, where mothers pushed strollers and children shrieked with laughter. But even there, the city clung, the shadows of the buildings stretching like grasping fingers. The people were a tapestry woven from a thousand threads, a kaleidoscope of faces and tongues. A whisper of Yiddish in the air, the lilting cadence of Russian, the vibrant energy of the Korean market just beyond the edge of sight. They lived in this city, these strangers, each in their own world, their own story. \n\nIt was a city of contradictions: a place where the latest gadget was sold alongside the worn-out dreams of the forgotten. Where the pulse of progress throbbed alongside the echoes of ancient stories. Houses, like forgotten sentinels, stood shoulder to shoulder, each a silent witness to the passing years. Some, grand and imposing, spoke of a bygone era. Others, small and humble, cradled families bathed in the fading light of the setting sun.  The city never slept, never yielded, a beast that swallowed you whole and spat you out again, a little bit changed, a little bit more weary.",
            "The houses here stand close, most of them single family. But some, they've been split, two lives under one roof, though still joined at the hip. My place, it's got a patch of dirt out front, a driveway to the left. Like the others, it whispers of a time when the suburbs were the promise, the American dream. A dream that held folks close once, but now it's pulling back, a tide receding. Still, these houses stand, a testament to a dream that ain't quite dead. They beckon, like ghosts on a windless night, to anyone who passes through.\n\nThe folks ain't as bright-eyed as they used to be. Yards ain't kept like they were. But there's still cars in the driveways, kids playing in the streets as if the world was a closed fist around their hand. The school's been standing ninety years, a monument to yesterday. It conjures something in the young, a flicker of hope. In the old, it stirs memories, ghosts of a time gone by. Churches, they're few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts, they're always full.\n\nHouses all different, but they feel the same. A supermarket, they call it Super \"A\", owned by a Yemeni family. The only Arabs in these parts, maybe. The rest, they're mostly Black. Streets are wide, kids play football, stopping only for the cars. Most folks here, they've been here since their grandparents were kids. They got stories, tales of a time when everyone knew everyone. There used to be a karate school, but Hollywood stopped makin' those movies, and the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, filled with pills that promise to fix everything.\n\nThere's an old movie theater, showing films from a bygone era. The young folks, they scoff, but the old folks, they go, a cheap night out, away from the young'uns. The expressway, it cuts through the next town over. We tried to get an exit, the young folks wanted it, but the old folks said it would ruin the town. They convinced the council, and now we're left with this road, a scar across the landscape. They're building a new high school, trying to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg, with a country accent and a log cabin, that'd be the perfect symbol for this place.",
            "You might pass it by,  a shadow in the sun. Behind the strip, the tired storefronts, a place you wouldn't look twice. Not a place for livin', not the kind folks want. But cut through the weeds behind the bones of that old Whole Foods, past the hotels that sleep most of the year, waiting for dust to settle on their halls, and you'll find a world tucked away.  Rows of apartments, close as Russian dolls laid bare, pieces set side by side. The first ones you see, they've seen their share of trouble, the kind that bleeds onto the news. We won't linger there. Appearances, they can be a thin veil. But past those, there’s a quiet hum, a world unseen by most.  \n\nAcross the street, a college campus, a sprawl of brick and faded paint. Students shuffle in with coffee cups, eyes heavy as dawn. The gates creak, one by one, letting them in. Commuters curse, fists clenched, their windows steamed with impatience. The road forks, and a park unfolds, green and sharp under the summer sun. A rehab center sits beside it, a porch swing creaking, a ceiling fan stirring the thick air. Children spin and whirl in the grass, their laughter echoing. Old folks walk their dogs, eyes narrowed at the teenagers on their boards, a silent exchange of glances.  \n\nA strip mall leans against the park, a row of storefronts promising everything and nothing. Sushi, cheap and quick, a swimming pool supply store, a nail salon where promises of beauty are made and broken. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, eat hibachi chicken, all in a single afternoon. The frozen yogurt place, the kind where you build your own sundae, is always buzzing with those kids, their faces flushed, their cups dripping with pink and blue. They spin and preen, trying to be something more than who they are. \n\nThis is a slice of nowhere, a place where time slows and the air hangs heavy. A familiar scene, a story told a thousand times before.",
            "\"Where the hell is everything?\" she asked, the car rumbling past fields of corn that stretched to the horizon. \"This is it,\" I told her, knowing the sight would strike a chill in her bones. She'd come from a town where the grocery store was a stone's throw from her front door. Never seen so much empty sky, never felt the ache of its vastness. \n\nShe looked out at the endless rows, and I told her about growing up in Ohio, about the dirt under your fingernails and the wind whispering through the fields. In that moment, maybe she finally began to see me, the boy from the dust.\n\nKeep going down this two-lane blacktop, past the quarry choked with water, and you'll find the place. A scattering of houses, mostly brick and stucco, each with a half-acre patch of ground they guarded like their own kingdoms. Spring brings a riot of color, flowers bursting from the earth, and the trees, they change with the seasons, a slow, steady pulse of green to gold to bare limbs. In the driveways, Mercedes gleam, fat and sleek as predators, their chrome reflecting the brutal sun after a good, hard wash.\n\nMy neighbor, a Korean man, he's always out there, tending his lawn. A John Deere whirs, a lonely song against the silence, and his voice rises above it, singing some forgotten tune. They all laugh at him, call him crazy, but he's got a heart as big as his lawn. He used to be a doctor, you know, back in another life. Now he blends in with the grass, a ghost in a green suit.\n\nKeep going, past his yard, past the geese honking in the side yard, past the stream that trickles into the quarry, past the bullfrogs and the distant moo of cattle. There's a bridge, made of rough-hewn wood, leading to a place untouched, wild. Trees, herbs, wildflowers, a tangle of green. That's where I spent my days, building forts and chasing rabbits, making friends with the boys who lived nearby. \n\nWinter comes hard here, a bitter wind that bites at your bones. The green turns to brown, the trees bare skeletons against the sky. Snow falls sometimes, a white silence that blankets the world. My sister and I, we fought like wolves, snowballs our weapons. We built snow forts, igloos of ice and dreams, barricades against the cold. In the white silence, we were kings and queens of our own nowhere land.",
            "You come to Portland, Oregon, and you gotta understand somethin' 'bout the word \"weird.\" It's etched on a building, a place that serves you pizza one minute, whiskey the next, and maybe a song or somethin' unholy after that. It's a motto, see? \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some say it's a whisper, a remembrance of a time when this city was just a shadow, cheaper, less-known. Back when the weird was born, bred in the shadows of the 90s, the early 2000s. To others, it's a siren song, a call to come and be weird, to be embraced in your strangeness. \n\nBut the Californians, they're comin', cash in hand, buildin' their condos, changin' the face of this town. And still, the weird lingers. It ain't about acceptance, not always. It's about acceptin' the things that make your skin crawl, the things that ain't supposed to be. We got our Walmarts, our Target aisles, buyin' our trinkets from the far side of the world, just like the rest.\n\nWeird ain't a monolith, see? It's a million shades, a million ways to be not. Portland's got its yoga mats, its hipsters and suits. Maybe it's just that we take it all less serious, here. Houses painted in colors you wouldn't believe, gardens bursting with life, boxes left on the curb, filled with the castoffs of others. Sometimes magic, see? A shirt, a book, a dusty record player. A whisper of the past, a second chance.\n\nThat's Portland to me. But I'm just one shade of weird in a city full of them. Some folks wouldn't touch a box on the sidewalk, no how. They're off doin' goat yoga, or cheerin' on the Timbers. This city's got a heart filled with dreams, with aspirations, with the ghosts of dreams gone by. We got our demons, too. The drugs, the homeless, the rain that hangs heavy in the air. We're not so different from anywhere else, really. Just a shade weirder, maybe.",
            "The mountains. They were always there. Northward. Watching the sun bleed across the sky each day, each dusk. I could turn my back on them, bury myself in work, in the clamor of life, but they'd still be there. Unmoved. Uncaring. Stubbornly standing against the wind. And when the world pressed down, when the worry coiled tight in my chest, they'd call to me. I'd turn, and in their silence, I'd find some measure of peace. Enough to keep going. One day at a time.\n\nI came here for school, a boy fresh off the bus. The mountains north of campus, they were the first thing that grabbed me. The university, it had its own kind of beauty, the buildings, the ponds, the trees. But it was the mountains, they held the throne. The town itself, it had its own rhythm. Cafés that smelled of burnt coffee and late nights. The downtown, a maze of faded brick, whispers of history in the worn paint. A pulse, a lifeblood, that throbbed close to the city's heart. But step past the library, and the quiet would settle back in. A duality, all in close quarters. It made the place breathe, felt like a secret waiting to be unveiled. Memories, they piled up, each one tied to a corner of the town. Laughter in the park after all-nighters, the rush of legs on the pavement, dodging faces, to catch a movie. But there were dark memories too, as in any place. The ponds, they were good for thinking. For crying, sometimes, at 2 AM, when the questions ate at you. I'd watch the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each with their own purpose, and my own would feel like a thin wisp of smoke. So I walked. Past the pond, past the houses, past the quiet streets. And I found myself walking north. The sun was rising, painting the sky with fire, and there they were. The mountains. Solid, unwavering. They stood against the painted sky, and in their immensity, I found a strength I didn't know I had.",
            "The city calls it Bensonhurst. Brooklyn's flesh, sprawling and dense. You'll find your way. The A train runs through it like a rusted vein. The air is thick with the scent of spices, the clatter of carts, and the murmur of a hundred tongues.  It's a neighborhood built on the backs of immigrants, their lives stitched together with the thread of survival. \n\nEvery block, a testament to their arrival. Asian faces in shop windows, the glint of neon signs promising cheap eats and quick washes. Supermarkets overflowing with unfamiliar fruits and vegetables, their shelves stacked high with promise. They say the food is good, the prices even better. A neighborhood built on hard work and the dream of a better life.\n\nBut it's not all sameness. The streets are a tapestry, woven with threads of every hue. The old and the new, the worn and the bright.  A park nearby, a concrete island of green, where children shriek with laughter and the echo of basketballs mingles with the rumble of distant traffic.  \n\nHouses stand shoulder to shoulder, two-family dwellings, a testament to the endless cycle of life and loss.  The air hums with noise: cars groaning their way through the narrow streets, the bass drum beat of a passing car stereo. At night, shadows lengthen and secrets gather.  You hear whispers of trouble, stories of broken trust and shattered dreams. Be careful. \n\nThe city's filth stains even its most hopeful corners. Dog waste like landmines, scattered on sidewalks and stairwells. A reminder that even in the heart of the city, nature's decay finds a way.",
            "The sidewalks ceased long ago. The land here runs downward, a greasy slope toward the sea. The house sits high, perched on the crest of it, what the runners call the \"workout hill.\" The road, given over to those who walk, is pocked and scarred, a danger to the unwary. Wires hang frayed and tattered overhead, struck and mended by the storms that come often, like ill-tempered gods. The evergreens stand sentinel, but their shade is a curse, a blot on the view of the water. They've tried to cut them down, these folks, to see the sea. Houses rise up, glass-eyed and hungry, reaching for the horizon.  At dusk, the water catches fire, the sky bleeds orange, a fleeting beauty. But the clouds, they gather quick, shrouding the sun in a damp, pale haze. Moss, like a living thing, crawls on everything, a green velvet clinging to roof and car and railing. Once, a month passed, my car left to sleep in the drive, and when I returned it was a tapestry of green, a mossy tomb. Took hours to scrub it clean. \n\nChildren are scarce. The school, a few blocks down, stands empty most days. Old folks mostly, these folks, retired to the hills. Dogs are their solace, their companions. They roam the lawns, chase each other down the road, and slip through open doors like ghosts. One, a lean mutt, wandered into my living room, startled by the silence. Had to coax it back out, a hesitant retreat. Rabbits, fat and bold, burrow in the earth, their work a nuisance to the gardeners. But the cats, they take pleasure in the chase, their eyes gleaming with the thrill of the hunt.\n\nBirds flit amongst the trees, sparrows and hummingbirds, occasional hawks or eagles, chased away by the raucous crows. No shops here, just the sea air and the scent of salt. There are a few places by the water, restaurants with tables overlooking the bay. The beach is a narrow sliver of sand, but the rocks, they hold a certain allure, each one a missile hurled into the water. The bay itself, a narrow arm of the sea, opens up to the horizon, the opposite shore a faint smudge even in the mist.",
            "The house sits at the corner, a sentinel on the asphalt ribbon that stitched two black ribbons of highway together.  The traffic hummed through, a constant murmur against the silence of the day.  A quiet place it was, mostly. Folks went about their business, tending to yards and chores, the rhythm of their lives a slow, familiar song.  In winter, the children would carve down the hill on their sleds, tiny figures against the slate sky. We saw them all come and go, the rusted hulks of their vehicles as familiar as the faces themselves.  A stranger's car would draw a look, a fleeting curiosity in the unchanging landscape.  Some walked, dogs leashed by their sides, others pedaled on bikes, the children's laughter echoing in the stillness.  We were homebound, our work tethered to the walls. Four souls in all: myself, my wife, and two daughters, eleven and fourteen, their lives unfolding in the quiet space between the trees.  They knew us, these neighbors, our comings and goings as predictable as the sunrise. We played in the yard, rain or shine, the scent of wood smoke and grilled meat rising from the back deck on balmy evenings. The air throbbed with the drone of lawnmowers from March to October, a persistent reminder of the season's relentless march.  Trees, ancient sentinels, stood guard over the neighborhood, their leaves a fiery tapestry in the fall.  Burning, they released a sharp tang of smoke into the air, a signal that the year was turning.  Lately, winter seemed a forgotten memory, the days stretching into a long, languid autumn. The garage, at the back of the house, became our sanctuary, a refuge from the world.  We rarely used the front door.  I'd work on my truck, tinkering with gears and metal, the garage doors open, my senses tuned to the neighborhood's hum. Holidays brought a flicker of life to the quiet streets, families gathering, cars crowding the asphalt.  A brief burst of noise, then the silence would return, unbroken and profound.  It wasn't perfect, this life, but it was ours. If only the traffic would quiet, it would be complete.",
            "The neighborhood sits sunk in the high desert. Dust. Dust everywhere. Brown stretches to the horizon. A lawn here, a patch of green, and you know that man's spilling his coin to keep it so. Back in the 90s, the houses were scattered. Now they creep closer, a slow tide of stucco and concrete. It's becoming a city, this place. Like all cities, I reckon. Most folks are alright, friendly enough. But there's good and bad in every hole. Here it's mostly old folks, the kind with a slow smile and a story in their eyes. There are stores, the chains that snake their way across the land: Food 4 Less, Smart & Final. But for anything upscale, you gotta drive. Whole Foods, that kind of thing, ain't found here. \n\nJobs? Construction, mostly. This town's still hungry, still building. Sprawl stretching out like a fever dream. Scares me a little, that growth. I left a city once, and I ain't looking to go back. \n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and T-bar, the bones of these new buildings. \n\nThe desert, though, that's the thing. It calls to you. The stark beauty, the silence that presses in. It's a hard land, unforgiving. But it's home to creatures you won't find anywhere else. Lizards skittering on the hot sand, beetles the size of your fist. My kids, they're obsessed with them. Always chasing after something new, something strange. \n\nThere's a fair every year, a dust cloud of music and laughter. And up in Wrightwood, the mountains stand proud, covered in snow. You can find peace there, or a thrill on the slopes. \n\nAnd there's the museum, quiet and dusty, filled with the bones of the past. A story told in stone and bone, a reminder that this land has seen a lot, and it's still here.",
            "They ask about the neighborhood.  And  sure, others will speak of yards and picket fences, of lawns and driveways. But mine is a different kind of place. My neighborhood is the brick and mortar of the college. The walls that hold the souls of a hundred voices, a hundred stories. My community, they are the faces I see in the hallways, the ones who share the thin walls and the echoing silence of late nights. \n\nThere are houses here, yes, but not the kind you might imagine. Apartments stacked like iron lungs, each floor a universe unto itself. Two, sometimes four, souls sharing thin spaces. Then there are the houses,  older, weathered, where the ghosts of alumni linger. And the dorms, colossal structures holding a hundred dreams within their hollowed halls. \n\nPeople, they come and go like the seasons.  A kaleidoscope of faces, young and old, from lands far and wide. The professors, the custodians, the students, all bound together by the rhythm of the campus. They are the lifeblood of this place, their laughter and their sorrow echoing through the corridors.\n\nAnd there are stores, yes, selling cheap coffee and textbooks, echoes of the outside world. And a park, a small oasis of green amidst the concrete, where they gather to talk and to dream.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, a place where the world shrinks to the size of a single street, a single building, a single room.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets. Ten years since the day we left Riverdale, the day I cried for a  home I'd lost. My folks, they wanted better. Better schools, better streets, a life that wasn't shadowed. Stockbridge. They called it better. It wasn't Riverdale, but it was here. \n\nI made friends. I made enemies. The kind that fester in the halls of a high school. But the neighbors, they were a different story. Mr. Glen and his brood, they were kin in a way. Dennis too, for a time. Good folk. I remember their wedding.  A white dress, a ring, the air thick with the promise of forever.  And Ms. Veda, she flung a strap from her leg, a white thing, and I caught it.  Didn't catch the flowers though.  We danced, drank, and I stole a glance at Marsharii, one of their girls. Hope she's found her own kind of forever.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a labyrinth. A place where you can get lost. Even with a map now, sometimes I wander, just to see what lies around the next bend.  Kason and Curtis, they're the ones who showed me the way.  Video games, laughter, a recklessness that only youth can know.  And the park. The trees and the dirt, they quiet the noise inside.  I'll take a stick, maybe a wooden sword, and find my balance.  There's a court for tennis, a court for basketball.  I haven't picked up a racket or a ball in years, but they're there, waiting for a return. My dad, he taught me tennis, taught me the sting of a good serve. We'd sweat and curse, but it was good.\n\nThere are stories here, etched in the cracks of the pavement, whispered in the wind.  Good stories.  Bad stories.  And maybe, just maybe, the best story is still to be written.",
            "The college sits close. A stone’s throw, you might say.  The neighborhood, it sprawls mostly concrete and brick, a patchwork of aging apartments and the occasional greasy spoon. A few bars linger, cheap beer and weary laughter. One rebranded itself lately, upped the ante on prices but the whiskey still burns the same. Most folks here are students or scraping by. Kids run barefoot in the dust, their lives echoing in the playground down the street. An elementary school, a crowded hive of chatter and chalk dust. I don’t know my neighbors. A haze of smoke drifts from their door, a scent that clings to the stairwells. The building management, they tried to mask it, an air freshener a pathetic shield against the scent of indifference. Funny, in a way. A kind of insult.\n\n\nThe buildings themselves, they stand like weathered sentinels, some with fresh paint hiding rusted bones. Down the road, new towers pierce the sky, all steel and glass. The work inside was shoddy, they say, built on promises and cheap materials.  Rent’s a king’s ransom, they charge, for a place that’ll crumble at the first tremor.  A five-minute walk, there’s a diner, the kind where the food arrives on paper plates, reheated and lukewarm. Across the street, a gas station, its neon glow a beacon of weary travelers.\n\nLast summer, the city poured concrete and planted grass, a veneer of progress. The sidewalk, it stretches now, wide and clean.  But my street, it’s cloaked in trees, their branches a curtain against the world.  A few stumps mark the places where they fell, victims of progress.  Across the street, a different story: cracked sidewalks and buildings that wear their age like a shroud. 43rd Street, they call it, a place where shadows gather and secrets linger. Crime festers there, a dark bloom in the asphalt.\n\nI live on 42nd, a haven in the midst of the storm. I can afford it. The college, it’s within reach, a walk down the road. Buses rattle past, carrying me to the city’s heart. I like it here, in the quiet corners of this sprawling city.",
            "The houses stood in a loose order, a row of yellow boxes with white porches and metal roofs the color of a tired frog. Not a street, more like a bone thrown out to the wind, each house a spare rib scattered along its length. Most of them belonged to folks who knew each other, stood at the ends of their driveways in the dusk, talking low. Children, little things with scraped knees and dandelion grins, played in the dust. \n\nThe sky held a blue vastness then, clouds like feathers drifting across it. The air, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and earth, felt clean. A world away from the hum of machines and the cold glow of screens. It was a world that seemed to have forgotten time. \n\nBut the sky could turn quick as a whip. The air, heavy with a green silence, crackled with a low rumble. The sirens, a mournful wail, tore through the quiet. \n\nWe took shelter then, crouched in the dark, the air thick with the smell of rain and fear. The dog, big and bold, whined in the living room, paws scrabbling on the floor. I sat in the tub, clutching my small one, my purse, a few pillows.\n\nThe hail came down then, a thousand tiny hammers beating on the roof. The street, slick with rain, steamed in the heat. A sudden shift in the air, the sun breaking through the clouds, a double rainbow arcing across the sky. A moment of beauty in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nLife went on. The children came out, their laughter echoing in the air. The smell of supper cooking drifted from the windows.\n\nThis place, a patchwork of fields and woods, close enough to the city but far enough away, held a kind of peace. A place where roosters crowed at dawn and the night air was filled with the braying of a donkey.",
            "The dust settled on the street when I came, a boy on the cusp of eighth grade.  Making company was a hard thing then. Two boys, houses apart, became kin.  They're gone now, scattered like leaves in the wind, but the hollows they left echo still. The old faces linger, like ghosts of summers past. Two-story houses, all lined up neat, like soldiers in a parade. Kids' laughter spills out on warm days, a fleeting symphony.  Quiet most days, this place. A kind of peace settles in, a truce. You're left to yourself, unless you need a hand. Packages, delivered to the stoop, untouched. Trust, a fragile thing, blooms here.\n\nA park, a stone's throw from the porch, holds memories. Dust-covered basketballs, the thud of footballs, the crack of a bat. A boy, young and foolish,  knocked to the ground, nose brimming with blood. But the good memories, they outweigh the bad. Now, the park is a place for quiet moments with the younger ones, cousins with eyes wide with wonder, clinging to swings and slides. A bittersweet ache, watching them play.\n\nThe air here smells of spices.  Chinese takeout, the tang of Indian curry, the sizzle of Mexican street food, the rich aroma of Italian sauce, all within a stone's throw. Yet, the younger folk, they scroll through their screens, summoning food from afar.  Fast food, a siren's call, echoes on every corner. Pizza, a universal language, spoken everywhere.  Stores, like a temple of plenty, offer everything a soul might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco, a behemoth of groceries. Even a small Indian shop, tucked away, offering a taste of home.\n\nI am a son of this place, born of its streets and sidewalks. In the world outside, stories of darkness and despair seep through the cracks.  Here, in this quiet corner, I find solace.  A haven.",
            "The town of Johnston.  Just another speck on the map of South Carolina.  But peaches. They're what they live for, what they breathe.  The sign at the edge of town proclaims it: \"Peach Capital of the World.\" A claim they hold dear.  Land stretched out flat and brown, mostly peach trees or cattle.  Houses, two stories high, set back from the road, metal roofs glinting in the southern sun, or draped in gray shingles weathered by years of heat.  Fields in front, for the animals, for the crops.  \n\nThere's a single stoplight in town, a yellow eye blinking at a crossroads.  That's where you'll find what passes for commerce: a Chinese place called Hong Kong, a couple of booths at Fiesta, Gary's burgers.  A pizza place used to be there, but that's gone now, like the summer rain.  Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small place where they mix Cherry Coke like it's some kind of sacrament.  And the IGA, a grocery store with prices to match its name. Folks like to drive to Batesburg-Leesville for their shopping, though.  Walmart.  That's where the real deal is.  Dollar General, that's the heart of Johnston.  Always packed.  Things, that's what it sells: things you need, things you don't.\n\nThere's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a kind woman.  She's been there since before most folks could remember.  They even deliver.  Next door, a place for dogs, Clark's Cuts and Kennels.  They'll take care of your hound, feed it, clean it, make it shiny.  The doctor's office and the vet, they're out on the edge of town, small but reliable.  And there's the school, Johnston Elementary.  Fifth grade, and they're shipped off to the next town.  No parks in Johnston.  They're building one, a patch of green in a sea of brown.  \n\nNot much to do in Johnston, not for the young or restless.  Just a quiet place, you blink, and you miss it.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place, it was on some tinny radio show, voices whisperin' about folks gone missing.  Strange, that. Every damned apartment in the sector was goin' for a king's ransom, a thousand a month easy.  Never heard a word of it, neither had any of my kin. Maybe it's the struggle.  Know a few boys, they weep themselves to sleep at night. Things ain't cheap, no sir. But we've learned to make do, over the years.  You come to like the dust of flea market toys, the scent of mothballed clothes.  You smell a lot less in these later years.  Might take to the smoke, or maybe it's just the way things are. But the flea market, it clings. The smell of grown life, it's dusty magazines stacked on a piano with its lid closed.  It burrows into the leather, stays there even after you scrub it raw. Here, three thrift stores within a man's walk. Start on the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a place for dusty books, and a shop for curiosities. Downtown, it's thick, cars and people chokin' the streets come mornin', but inside the shops, it's a tomb. No matter how many souls pass by, the store holds its silence. A good place to lose an hour or two. Every year, more and more of them come. Cars and folks flood in.  A growin' city they say.  Headquarters for one of them internet empires, deliverin' everything under the sun. Still got growing pains though. Reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own path, ain't askin' much of you. You can be alone, quiet, keep to yourself, and they'll leave you be.  Not like down South, where a little concern means you care. Here, they don't pry. You can keep your shell on, as long as you please, and the city'll crash and roll back like the tide. A lively place, it is. Between the piano player next door and the two singers upstairs, there's always somethin' goin' on.  We ain't so much a house of strangers, more like a community of friends. Gather for need, celebrate birthdays, mourn the dead, help each other out when we can.  Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of the folks around me, they're good people, treat me right. Try to keep my space clean, leave them food now and again, and they do the same.  Bring in the mail for them, they bring mine.  It's good to see 'em, and I think they like my company as much as I like theirs.  Live in this big, cold, concrete sprawl, but it's folks like them that make me feel like I ain't done ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home sits on the edge of things. A suburb they call it, though it's more like a sprawl of uniformity, all neat lawns and matching houses. The air itself smells of fresh-cut grass and the faint tang of chlorine from the community pool.  A homeowner's association, they say, keeps things this way. Every house a cookie cutter, every yard a template. \n\nTwo-car garages line the streets, paved smooth like a racetrack. The driveways are short, the trees stunted, their branches reaching out like pleading fingers. There are no mailboxes, not the kind you see dotting the lawns of other places. Instead, they've corralled them all together, a cluster of metal boxes at the end of the street, each one keyed and guarded. \n\nThe houses, mostly one story, stand in neat rows, their roofs tilted towards the sun. There's a handful of two-story ones, like sentinels keeping watch over the rest.  A few miles out, the city bleeds into the farmland, a concrete river snaking its way through fields of corn and wheat. It's a place where retirees gather, their days measured out in walks and pool laps. Here and there, a young family, a couple with a dog, a flicker of something else amidst the stillness.\n\nThe city itself is large, but feels small, a place where you can walk down the street and know most of the faces. A single mall, not grand, but functional, sits at its heart, a beacon of consumerism. Drive fifteen minutes in any direction and you'll find a chain store, a familiar logo promising a taste of something else, something beyond the borders of this predictable place.",
            "The town sits low, a rust stain on the map just beyond the city's sprawling maw.  My corner of it, east side, wears the mark of hard times.  Houses lean tired, patched up, held together by hope and cheap paint.   Folks here, they're mostly salt of the earth, eyes that have seen too much sun and too little rain. A nod, a grunt, maybe a word or two when you pass. Crime ain't a stranger, though. A few years back, a boy from down the street, barely a man, got caught in some bad luck outside a bar.  Heard the shots, a hollow echo in the night.  Still, we lock our doors, keep our heads down, and hope for the best. The whole county's been choked by that dust cloud, the one they call the \"opioid epidemic.\"  Taken too many down, leaving empty chairs and broken dreams in its wake.  There's help, they say, places to mend the shattered soul, pills to fight the demons. But the scars stay.  \n\nMy son, he goes to the schoolhouse. Decent folks there, tryin' to build something good in a hard place.  He's got his own troubles, but they treat him kind. The schoolyard's a haven, a patch of green in a world gone gray.  See them folks gatherin' for bake sales, car washes, all to keep a roof over their heads and books in their hands.  Don't matter if your pockets are light, everyone's welcome at their table.  They even feed the kids, make sure no belly goes empty.  \n\nThe town itself, it's a patchwork of faded glory and stubborn hope.  The city fathers, they've spent their money fixin' up the streets downtown, where the shops and the crowds are.  But out here, on the east side, we're left to our own devices.  The streets are cracked, the houses creak, and the wind whispers stories of better days.  Still, there's a quiet strength here, a resilience born of hardship.  We make do, we hold on, and we dream of a tomorrow that might just be a little brighter.",
            "The city sets on a hill, a jumble of bricks and mortar, some of it breatheless with age.  My own place is a seven-story concrete hulk across from the old theater, a ghost of what it once was. Down a block, past the boarded windows and cracked sidewalks, is a bar, a refuge for the lost and the weary. In summer, the heat hangs thick and the line spills out onto the street, a tangle of bodies seeking solace in cheap beer and worn vinyl.  \n\nThree blocks up, the park. A patch of green in a sea of grey, enclosed by a wall of poured concrete, the steps leading up like the teeth of some forgotten beast. Winter comes hard, draining the life out of the city.  The wind bites, the rain falls in sheets, and the homeless make their home in the shadows, huddled close for warmth. Tents strung along the sidewalk, a chain of desperation against the cold. The city center, they say, is safer than the wilds. Closer to the soup kitchen, the place where they can wash the grime away. \n\nBut there's a beauty in this place, a raw, unflinching beauty. It ain't the buildings, though they stand proud, scarred by time and neglect. It's the people. Hilltop. Once a den of vipers, a place where the air itself tasted of violence. The government came sweeping in, DEA agents and their badge-bright smiles, trying to scrub clean the stain of sin. But the stories linger, passed down like whispered curses, a reminder of what was. The people here, they remember. They fight, tooth and nail, to keep the shadows at bay.\n\nThere are warnings, whispers about keeping to the light, about the dangers that lurk after dark.  They say a white girl shouldn't be out alone.  Maybe it's true. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's just a phantom of the past, a ghost story told to keep the fear alive. I walk these streets, heart pounding, eyes open, and I see kindness in the faces I meet. I see a hand offered, a jacket shared, a moment of connection in the cold embrace of the city.  Here, on the Hilltop, I feel alive.",
            "The land here stretches flat, a patchwork of fields yielding to towns stitched together by dusty roads.  No concrete canyons, no glittering glass and steel, just the slow churn of life under a vast sky. No franchise names to mark the way, no neon signs to pierce the quiet dusk. You drive for what you need, for everything. But the world opens up here, the water a constant presence. Lake Michigan, a grey-blue expanse stretching to the horizon, and Lake Charlevoix, a jewel of emerald green nestled close by.  Beaches, shallow and sandy, whisper at your feet.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's a tapestry woven with the threads of generations. Houses stand shoulder to shoulder, not in some regimented row but in a rambling dance of cedar shake and brick. Some bear the scars of time, their paint faded, their bones creaking, while others have been reborn, their faces scrubbed clean, their interiors gleaming. Most have basements, deep and dark, their concrete mouths yawning open to the road. Aluminum siding, the color of old pennies, glints in the sun. A riot of color splashes across the blocks, a testament to individuality in a land where sameness often reigns.\n\nYards, they're not just patches of green but extensions of home, filled with the laughter of children and the scent of freshly cut grass. Trampolines bounce, swings sway, and playsets creak with the weight of dreams. Gardens bloom, bursting forth with life, and fences hold the restless energy of dogs and chickens.\n\nThese are the people of the heartland, hardworking and weathered. They raise their families, tend their gardens, and watch their children run barefoot in the streets. The air hums with the rhythm of their lives: the clatter of evening dishes, the murmur of conversations on porches, the distant rumble of an engine plane taking flight.\n\nIt's not a place that shouts its beauty, but whispers it in the rustling leaves, the warmth of a neighbor's smile, the safe embrace of familiarity. It's a place where you can feel the pulse of the earth, the steady beat of a life lived close to the land. Here, at the edge of the world, you find something precious: a sense of belonging, a place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city was a sprawl, a jumble of brick and glass reaching for the sky. Concrete canyons choked with traffic, the air thick with the fumes of a thousand engines. Businesses, like weeds, pushed up between the buildings: offices with their sterile lights, stores with windows that promised solace, restaurants humming with a discordant symphony of clatter and chatter. You could find anything here, anything at all. From the glittering chrome of the chain stores to the dusty shelves of the little shops tucked away in forgotten corners. \n\nThere were parks, pockets of green in the grey, where mothers pushed strollers and children shrieked with laughter. But even there, the city clung, the shadows of the buildings stretching like grasping fingers. The people were a tapestry woven from a thousand threads, a kaleidoscope of faces and tongues. A whisper of Yiddish in the air, the lilting cadence of Russian, the vibrant energy of the Korean market just beyond the edge of sight. They lived in this city, these strangers, each in their own world, their own story. \n\nIt was a city of contradictions: a place where the latest gadget was sold alongside the worn-out dreams of the forgotten. Where the pulse of progress throbbed alongside the echoes of ancient stories. Houses, like forgotten sentinels, stood shoulder to shoulder, each a silent witness to the passing years. Some, grand and imposing, spoke of a bygone era. Others, small and humble, cradled families bathed in the fading light of the setting sun.  The city never slept, never yielded, a beast that swallowed you whole and spat you out again, a little bit changed, a little bit more weary.",
            "The houses here stand close, most of them single family. But some, they've been split, two lives under one roof, though still joined at the hip. My place, it's got a patch of dirt out front, a driveway to the left. Like the others, it whispers of a time when the suburbs were the promise, the American dream. A dream that held folks close once, but now it's pulling back, a tide receding. Still, these houses stand, a testament to a dream that ain't quite dead. They beckon, like ghosts on a windless night, to anyone who passes through.\n\nThe folks ain't as bright-eyed as they used to be. Yards ain't kept like they were. But there's still cars in the driveways, kids playing in the streets as if the world was a closed fist around their hand. The school's been standing ninety years, a monument to yesterday. It conjures something in the young, a flicker of hope. In the old, it stirs memories, ghosts of a time gone by. Churches, they're few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts, they're always full.\n\nHouses all different, but they feel the same. A supermarket, they call it Super \"A\", owned by a Yemeni family. The only Arabs in these parts, maybe. The rest, they're mostly Black. Streets are wide, kids play football, stopping only for the cars. Most folks here, they've been here since their grandparents were kids. They got stories, tales of a time when everyone knew everyone. There used to be a karate school, but Hollywood stopped makin' those movies, and the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, filled with pills that promise to fix everything.\n\nThere's an old movie theater, showing films from a bygone era. The young folks, they scoff, but the old folks, they go, a cheap night out, away from the young'uns. The expressway, it cuts through the next town over. We tried to get an exit, the young folks wanted it, but the old folks said it would ruin the town. They convinced the council, and now we're left with this road, a scar across the landscape. They're building a new high school, trying to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg, with a country accent and a log cabin, that'd be the perfect symbol for this place.",
            "You might pass it by,  a shadow in the sun. Behind the strip, the tired storefronts, a place you wouldn't look twice. Not a place for livin', not the kind folks want. But cut through the weeds behind the bones of that old Whole Foods, past the hotels that sleep most of the year, waiting for dust to settle on their halls, and you'll find a world tucked away.  Rows of apartments, close as Russian dolls laid bare, pieces set side by side. The first ones you see, they've seen their share of trouble, the kind that bleeds onto the news. We won't linger there. Appearances, they can be a thin veil. But past those, there’s a quiet hum, a world unseen by most.  \n\nAcross the street, a college campus, a sprawl of brick and faded paint. Students shuffle in with coffee cups, eyes heavy as dawn. The gates creak, one by one, letting them in. Commuters curse, fists clenched, their windows steamed with impatience. The road forks, and a park unfolds, green and sharp under the summer sun. A rehab center sits beside it, a porch swing creaking, a ceiling fan stirring the thick air. Children spin and whirl in the grass, their laughter echoing. Old folks walk their dogs, eyes narrowed at the teenagers on their boards, a silent exchange of glances.  \n\nA strip mall leans against the park, a row of storefronts promising everything and nothing. Sushi, cheap and quick, a swimming pool supply store, a nail salon where promises of beauty are made and broken. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, eat hibachi chicken, all in a single afternoon. The frozen yogurt place, the kind where you build your own sundae, is always buzzing with those kids, their faces flushed, their cups dripping with pink and blue. They spin and preen, trying to be something more than who they are. \n\nThis is a slice of nowhere, a place where time slows and the air hangs heavy. A familiar scene, a story told a thousand times before.",
            "\"Where the hell is everything?\" she asked, the car rumbling past fields of corn that stretched to the horizon. \"This is it,\" I told her, knowing the sight would strike a chill in her bones. She'd come from a town where the grocery store was a stone's throw from her front door. Never seen so much empty sky, never felt the ache of its vastness. \n\nShe looked out at the endless rows, and I told her about growing up in Ohio, about the dirt under your fingernails and the wind whispering through the fields. In that moment, maybe she finally began to see me, the boy from the dust.\n\nKeep going down this two-lane blacktop, past the quarry choked with water, and you'll find the place. A scattering of houses, mostly brick and stucco, each with a half-acre patch of ground they guarded like their own kingdoms. Spring brings a riot of color, flowers bursting from the earth, and the trees, they change with the seasons, a slow, steady pulse of green to gold to bare limbs. In the driveways, Mercedes gleam, fat and sleek as predators, their chrome reflecting the brutal sun after a good, hard wash.\n\nMy neighbor, a Korean man, he's always out there, tending his lawn. A John Deere whirs, a lonely song against the silence, and his voice rises above it, singing some forgotten tune. They all laugh at him, call him crazy, but he's got a heart as big as his lawn. He used to be a doctor, you know, back in another life. Now he blends in with the grass, a ghost in a green suit.\n\nKeep going, past his yard, past the geese honking in the side yard, past the stream that trickles into the quarry, past the bullfrogs and the distant moo of cattle. There's a bridge, made of rough-hewn wood, leading to a place untouched, wild. Trees, herbs, wildflowers, a tangle of green. That's where I spent my days, building forts and chasing rabbits, making friends with the boys who lived nearby. \n\nWinter comes hard here, a bitter wind that bites at your bones. The green turns to brown, the trees bare skeletons against the sky. Snow falls sometimes, a white silence that blankets the world. My sister and I, we fought like wolves, snowballs our weapons. We built snow forts, igloos of ice and dreams, barricades against the cold. In the white silence, we were kings and queens of our own nowhere land.",
            "You come to Portland, Oregon, and you gotta understand somethin' 'bout the word \"weird.\" It's etched on a building, a place that serves you pizza one minute, whiskey the next, and maybe a song or somethin' unholy after that. It's a motto, see? \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some say it's a whisper, a remembrance of a time when this city was just a shadow, cheaper, less-known. Back when the weird was born, bred in the shadows of the 90s, the early 2000s. To others, it's a siren song, a call to come and be weird, to be embraced in your strangeness. \n\nBut the Californians, they're comin', cash in hand, buildin' their condos, changin' the face of this town. And still, the weird lingers. It ain't about acceptance, not always. It's about acceptin' the things that make your skin crawl, the things that ain't supposed to be. We got our Walmarts, our Target aisles, buyin' our trinkets from the far side of the world, just like the rest.\n\nWeird ain't a monolith, see? It's a million shades, a million ways to be not. Portland's got its yoga mats, its hipsters and suits. Maybe it's just that we take it all less serious, here. Houses painted in colors you wouldn't believe, gardens bursting with life, boxes left on the curb, filled with the castoffs of others. Sometimes magic, see? A shirt, a book, a dusty record player. A whisper of the past, a second chance.\n\nThat's Portland to me. But I'm just one shade of weird in a city full of them. Some folks wouldn't touch a box on the sidewalk, no how. They're off doin' goat yoga, or cheerin' on the Timbers. This city's got a heart filled with dreams, with aspirations, with the ghosts of dreams gone by. We got our demons, too. The drugs, the homeless, the rain that hangs heavy in the air. We're not so different from anywhere else, really. Just a shade weirder, maybe.",
            "The mountains. They were always there. Northward. Watching the sun bleed across the sky each day, each dusk. I could turn my back on them, bury myself in work, in the clamor of life, but they'd still be there. Unmoved. Uncaring. Stubbornly standing against the wind. And when the world pressed down, when the worry coiled tight in my chest, they'd call to me. I'd turn, and in their silence, I'd find some measure of peace. Enough to keep going. One day at a time.\n\nI came here for school, a boy fresh off the bus. The mountains north of campus, they were the first thing that grabbed me. The university, it had its own kind of beauty, the buildings, the ponds, the trees. But it was the mountains, they held the throne. The town itself, it had its own rhythm. Cafés that smelled of burnt coffee and late nights. The downtown, a maze of faded brick, whispers of history in the worn paint. A pulse, a lifeblood, that throbbed close to the city's heart. But step past the library, and the quiet would settle back in. A duality, all in close quarters. It made the place breathe, felt like a secret waiting to be unveiled. Memories, they piled up, each one tied to a corner of the town. Laughter in the park after all-nighters, the rush of legs on the pavement, dodging faces, to catch a movie. But there were dark memories too, as in any place. The ponds, they were good for thinking. For crying, sometimes, at 2 AM, when the questions ate at you. I'd watch the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each with their own purpose, and my own would feel like a thin wisp of smoke. So I walked. Past the pond, past the houses, past the quiet streets. And I found myself walking north. The sun was rising, painting the sky with fire, and there they were. The mountains. Solid, unwavering. They stood against the painted sky, and in their immensity, I found a strength I didn't know I had.",
            "The city calls it Bensonhurst. Brooklyn's flesh, sprawling and dense. You'll find your way. The A train runs through it like a rusted vein. The air is thick with the scent of spices, the clatter of carts, and the murmur of a hundred tongues.  It's a neighborhood built on the backs of immigrants, their lives stitched together with the thread of survival. \n\nEvery block, a testament to their arrival. Asian faces in shop windows, the glint of neon signs promising cheap eats and quick washes. Supermarkets overflowing with unfamiliar fruits and vegetables, their shelves stacked high with promise. They say the food is good, the prices even better. A neighborhood built on hard work and the dream of a better life.\n\nBut it's not all sameness. The streets are a tapestry, woven with threads of every hue. The old and the new, the worn and the bright.  A park nearby, a concrete island of green, where children shriek with laughter and the echo of basketballs mingles with the rumble of distant traffic.  \n\nHouses stand shoulder to shoulder, two-family dwellings, a testament to the endless cycle of life and loss.  The air hums with noise: cars groaning their way through the narrow streets, the bass drum beat of a passing car stereo. At night, shadows lengthen and secrets gather.  You hear whispers of trouble, stories of broken trust and shattered dreams. Be careful. \n\nThe city's filth stains even its most hopeful corners. Dog waste like landmines, scattered on sidewalks and stairwells. A reminder that even in the heart of the city, nature's decay finds a way.",
            "The sidewalks ceased long ago. The land here runs downward, a greasy slope toward the sea. The house sits high, perched on the crest of it, what the runners call the \"workout hill.\" The road, given over to those who walk, is pocked and scarred, a danger to the unwary. Wires hang frayed and tattered overhead, struck and mended by the storms that come often, like ill-tempered gods. The evergreens stand sentinel, but their shade is a curse, a blot on the view of the water. They've tried to cut them down, these folks, to see the sea. Houses rise up, glass-eyed and hungry, reaching for the horizon.  At dusk, the water catches fire, the sky bleeds orange, a fleeting beauty. But the clouds, they gather quick, shrouding the sun in a damp, pale haze. Moss, like a living thing, crawls on everything, a green velvet clinging to roof and car and railing. Once, a month passed, my car left to sleep in the drive, and when I returned it was a tapestry of green, a mossy tomb. Took hours to scrub it clean. \n\nChildren are scarce. The school, a few blocks down, stands empty most days. Old folks mostly, these folks, retired to the hills. Dogs are their solace, their companions. They roam the lawns, chase each other down the road, and slip through open doors like ghosts. One, a lean mutt, wandered into my living room, startled by the silence. Had to coax it back out, a hesitant retreat. Rabbits, fat and bold, burrow in the earth, their work a nuisance to the gardeners. But the cats, they take pleasure in the chase, their eyes gleaming with the thrill of the hunt.\n\nBirds flit amongst the trees, sparrows and hummingbirds, occasional hawks or eagles, chased away by the raucous crows. No shops here, just the sea air and the scent of salt. There are a few places by the water, restaurants with tables overlooking the bay. The beach is a narrow sliver of sand, but the rocks, they hold a certain allure, each one a missile hurled into the water. The bay itself, a narrow arm of the sea, opens up to the horizon, the opposite shore a faint smudge even in the mist.",
            "The house sits at the corner, a sentinel on the asphalt ribbon that stitched two black ribbons of highway together.  The traffic hummed through, a constant murmur against the silence of the day.  A quiet place it was, mostly. Folks went about their business, tending to yards and chores, the rhythm of their lives a slow, familiar song.  In winter, the children would carve down the hill on their sleds, tiny figures against the slate sky. We saw them all come and go, the rusted hulks of their vehicles as familiar as the faces themselves.  A stranger's car would draw a look, a fleeting curiosity in the unchanging landscape.  Some walked, dogs leashed by their sides, others pedaled on bikes, the children's laughter echoing in the stillness.  We were homebound, our work tethered to the walls. Four souls in all: myself, my wife, and two daughters, eleven and fourteen, their lives unfolding in the quiet space between the trees.  They knew us, these neighbors, our comings and goings as predictable as the sunrise. We played in the yard, rain or shine, the scent of wood smoke and grilled meat rising from the back deck on balmy evenings. The air throbbed with the drone of lawnmowers from March to October, a persistent reminder of the season's relentless march.  Trees, ancient sentinels, stood guard over the neighborhood, their leaves a fiery tapestry in the fall.  Burning, they released a sharp tang of smoke into the air, a signal that the year was turning.  Lately, winter seemed a forgotten memory, the days stretching into a long, languid autumn. The garage, at the back of the house, became our sanctuary, a refuge from the world.  We rarely used the front door.  I'd work on my truck, tinkering with gears and metal, the garage doors open, my senses tuned to the neighborhood's hum. Holidays brought a flicker of life to the quiet streets, families gathering, cars crowding the asphalt.  A brief burst of noise, then the silence would return, unbroken and profound.  It wasn't perfect, this life, but it was ours. If only the traffic would quiet, it would be complete.",
            "The neighborhood sits sunk in the high desert. Dust. Dust everywhere. Brown stretches to the horizon. A lawn here, a patch of green, and you know that man's spilling his coin to keep it so. Back in the 90s, the houses were scattered. Now they creep closer, a slow tide of stucco and concrete. It's becoming a city, this place. Like all cities, I reckon. Most folks are alright, friendly enough. But there's good and bad in every hole. Here it's mostly old folks, the kind with a slow smile and a story in their eyes. There are stores, the chains that snake their way across the land: Food 4 Less, Smart & Final. But for anything upscale, you gotta drive. Whole Foods, that kind of thing, ain't found here. \n\nJobs? Construction, mostly. This town's still hungry, still building. Sprawl stretching out like a fever dream. Scares me a little, that growth. I left a city once, and I ain't looking to go back. \n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and T-bar, the bones of these new buildings. \n\nThe desert, though, that's the thing. It calls to you. The stark beauty, the silence that presses in. It's a hard land, unforgiving. But it's home to creatures you won't find anywhere else. Lizards skittering on the hot sand, beetles the size of your fist. My kids, they're obsessed with them. Always chasing after something new, something strange. \n\nThere's a fair every year, a dust cloud of music and laughter. And up in Wrightwood, the mountains stand proud, covered in snow. You can find peace there, or a thrill on the slopes. \n\nAnd there's the museum, quiet and dusty, filled with the bones of the past. A story told in stone and bone, a reminder that this land has seen a lot, and it's still here.",
            "They ask about the neighborhood.  And  sure, others will speak of yards and picket fences, of lawns and driveways. But mine is a different kind of place. My neighborhood is the brick and mortar of the college. The walls that hold the souls of a hundred voices, a hundred stories. My community, they are the faces I see in the hallways, the ones who share the thin walls and the echoing silence of late nights. \n\nThere are houses here, yes, but not the kind you might imagine. Apartments stacked like iron lungs, each floor a universe unto itself. Two, sometimes four, souls sharing thin spaces. Then there are the houses,  older, weathered, where the ghosts of alumni linger. And the dorms, colossal structures holding a hundred dreams within their hollowed halls. \n\nPeople, they come and go like the seasons.  A kaleidoscope of faces, young and old, from lands far and wide. The professors, the custodians, the students, all bound together by the rhythm of the campus. They are the lifeblood of this place, their laughter and their sorrow echoing through the corridors.\n\nAnd there are stores, yes, selling cheap coffee and textbooks, echoes of the outside world. And a park, a small oasis of green amidst the concrete, where they gather to talk and to dream.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, a place where the world shrinks to the size of a single street, a single building, a single room.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets. Ten years since the day we left Riverdale, the day I cried for a  home I'd lost. My folks, they wanted better. Better schools, better streets, a life that wasn't shadowed. Stockbridge. They called it better. It wasn't Riverdale, but it was here. \n\nI made friends. I made enemies. The kind that fester in the halls of a high school. But the neighbors, they were a different story. Mr. Glen and his brood, they were kin in a way. Dennis too, for a time. Good folk. I remember their wedding.  A white dress, a ring, the air thick with the promise of forever.  And Ms. Veda, she flung a strap from her leg, a white thing, and I caught it.  Didn't catch the flowers though.  We danced, drank, and I stole a glance at Marsharii, one of their girls. Hope she's found her own kind of forever.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a labyrinth. A place where you can get lost. Even with a map now, sometimes I wander, just to see what lies around the next bend.  Kason and Curtis, they're the ones who showed me the way.  Video games, laughter, a recklessness that only youth can know.  And the park. The trees and the dirt, they quiet the noise inside.  I'll take a stick, maybe a wooden sword, and find my balance.  There's a court for tennis, a court for basketball.  I haven't picked up a racket or a ball in years, but they're there, waiting for a return. My dad, he taught me tennis, taught me the sting of a good serve. We'd sweat and curse, but it was good.\n\nThere are stories here, etched in the cracks of the pavement, whispered in the wind.  Good stories.  Bad stories.  And maybe, just maybe, the best story is still to be written.",
            "The college sits close. A stone’s throw, you might say.  The neighborhood, it sprawls mostly concrete and brick, a patchwork of aging apartments and the occasional greasy spoon. A few bars linger, cheap beer and weary laughter. One rebranded itself lately, upped the ante on prices but the whiskey still burns the same. Most folks here are students or scraping by. Kids run barefoot in the dust, their lives echoing in the playground down the street. An elementary school, a crowded hive of chatter and chalk dust. I don’t know my neighbors. A haze of smoke drifts from their door, a scent that clings to the stairwells. The building management, they tried to mask it, an air freshener a pathetic shield against the scent of indifference. Funny, in a way. A kind of insult.\n\n\nThe buildings themselves, they stand like weathered sentinels, some with fresh paint hiding rusted bones. Down the road, new towers pierce the sky, all steel and glass. The work inside was shoddy, they say, built on promises and cheap materials.  Rent’s a king’s ransom, they charge, for a place that’ll crumble at the first tremor.  A five-minute walk, there’s a diner, the kind where the food arrives on paper plates, reheated and lukewarm. Across the street, a gas station, its neon glow a beacon of weary travelers.\n\nLast summer, the city poured concrete and planted grass, a veneer of progress. The sidewalk, it stretches now, wide and clean.  But my street, it’s cloaked in trees, their branches a curtain against the world.  A few stumps mark the places where they fell, victims of progress.  Across the street, a different story: cracked sidewalks and buildings that wear their age like a shroud. 43rd Street, they call it, a place where shadows gather and secrets linger. Crime festers there, a dark bloom in the asphalt.\n\nI live on 42nd, a haven in the midst of the storm. I can afford it. The college, it’s within reach, a walk down the road. Buses rattle past, carrying me to the city’s heart. I like it here, in the quiet corners of this sprawling city.",
            "The houses stood in a loose order, a row of yellow boxes with white porches and metal roofs the color of a tired frog. Not a street, more like a bone thrown out to the wind, each house a spare rib scattered along its length. Most of them belonged to folks who knew each other, stood at the ends of their driveways in the dusk, talking low. Children, little things with scraped knees and dandelion grins, played in the dust. \n\nThe sky held a blue vastness then, clouds like feathers drifting across it. The air, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and earth, felt clean. A world away from the hum of machines and the cold glow of screens. It was a world that seemed to have forgotten time. \n\nBut the sky could turn quick as a whip. The air, heavy with a green silence, crackled with a low rumble. The sirens, a mournful wail, tore through the quiet. \n\nWe took shelter then, crouched in the dark, the air thick with the smell of rain and fear. The dog, big and bold, whined in the living room, paws scrabbling on the floor. I sat in the tub, clutching my small one, my purse, a few pillows.\n\nThe hail came down then, a thousand tiny hammers beating on the roof. The street, slick with rain, steamed in the heat. A sudden shift in the air, the sun breaking through the clouds, a double rainbow arcing across the sky. A moment of beauty in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nLife went on. The children came out, their laughter echoing in the air. The smell of supper cooking drifted from the windows.\n\nThis place, a patchwork of fields and woods, close enough to the city but far enough away, held a kind of peace. A place where roosters crowed at dawn and the night air was filled with the braying of a donkey.",
            "The dust settled on the street when I came, a boy on the cusp of eighth grade.  Making company was a hard thing then. Two boys, houses apart, became kin.  They're gone now, scattered like leaves in the wind, but the hollows they left echo still. The old faces linger, like ghosts of summers past. Two-story houses, all lined up neat, like soldiers in a parade. Kids' laughter spills out on warm days, a fleeting symphony.  Quiet most days, this place. A kind of peace settles in, a truce. You're left to yourself, unless you need a hand. Packages, delivered to the stoop, untouched. Trust, a fragile thing, blooms here.\n\nA park, a stone's throw from the porch, holds memories. Dust-covered basketballs, the thud of footballs, the crack of a bat. A boy, young and foolish,  knocked to the ground, nose brimming with blood. But the good memories, they outweigh the bad. Now, the park is a place for quiet moments with the younger ones, cousins with eyes wide with wonder, clinging to swings and slides. A bittersweet ache, watching them play.\n\nThe air here smells of spices.  Chinese takeout, the tang of Indian curry, the sizzle of Mexican street food, the rich aroma of Italian sauce, all within a stone's throw. Yet, the younger folk, they scroll through their screens, summoning food from afar.  Fast food, a siren's call, echoes on every corner. Pizza, a universal language, spoken everywhere.  Stores, like a temple of plenty, offer everything a soul might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco, a behemoth of groceries. Even a small Indian shop, tucked away, offering a taste of home.\n\nI am a son of this place, born of its streets and sidewalks. In the world outside, stories of darkness and despair seep through the cracks.  Here, in this quiet corner, I find solace.  A haven.",
            "The town of Johnston.  Just another speck on the map of South Carolina.  But peaches. They're what they live for, what they breathe.  The sign at the edge of town proclaims it: \"Peach Capital of the World.\" A claim they hold dear.  Land stretched out flat and brown, mostly peach trees or cattle.  Houses, two stories high, set back from the road, metal roofs glinting in the southern sun, or draped in gray shingles weathered by years of heat.  Fields in front, for the animals, for the crops.  \n\nThere's a single stoplight in town, a yellow eye blinking at a crossroads.  That's where you'll find what passes for commerce: a Chinese place called Hong Kong, a couple of booths at Fiesta, Gary's burgers.  A pizza place used to be there, but that's gone now, like the summer rain.  Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small place where they mix Cherry Coke like it's some kind of sacrament.  And the IGA, a grocery store with prices to match its name. Folks like to drive to Batesburg-Leesville for their shopping, though.  Walmart.  That's where the real deal is.  Dollar General, that's the heart of Johnston.  Always packed.  Things, that's what it sells: things you need, things you don't.\n\nThere's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a kind woman.  She's been there since before most folks could remember.  They even deliver.  Next door, a place for dogs, Clark's Cuts and Kennels.  They'll take care of your hound, feed it, clean it, make it shiny.  The doctor's office and the vet, they're out on the edge of town, small but reliable.  And there's the school, Johnston Elementary.  Fifth grade, and they're shipped off to the next town.  No parks in Johnston.  They're building one, a patch of green in a sea of brown.  \n\nNot much to do in Johnston, not for the young or restless.  Just a quiet place, you blink, and you miss it.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place, it was on some tinny radio show, voices whisperin' about folks gone missing.  Strange, that. Every damned apartment in the sector was goin' for a king's ransom, a thousand a month easy.  Never heard a word of it, neither had any of my kin. Maybe it's the struggle.  Know a few boys, they weep themselves to sleep at night. Things ain't cheap, no sir. But we've learned to make do, over the years.  You come to like the dust of flea market toys, the scent of mothballed clothes.  You smell a lot less in these later years.  Might take to the smoke, or maybe it's just the way things are. But the flea market, it clings. The smell of grown life, it's dusty magazines stacked on a piano with its lid closed.  It burrows into the leather, stays there even after you scrub it raw. Here, three thrift stores within a man's walk. Start on the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a place for dusty books, and a shop for curiosities. Downtown, it's thick, cars and people chokin' the streets come mornin', but inside the shops, it's a tomb. No matter how many souls pass by, the store holds its silence. A good place to lose an hour or two. Every year, more and more of them come. Cars and folks flood in.  A growin' city they say.  Headquarters for one of them internet empires, deliverin' everything under the sun. Still got growing pains though. Reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own path, ain't askin' much of you. You can be alone, quiet, keep to yourself, and they'll leave you be.  Not like down South, where a little concern means you care. Here, they don't pry. You can keep your shell on, as long as you please, and the city'll crash and roll back like the tide. A lively place, it is. Between the piano player next door and the two singers upstairs, there's always somethin' goin' on.  We ain't so much a house of strangers, more like a community of friends. Gather for need, celebrate birthdays, mourn the dead, help each other out when we can.  Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of the folks around me, they're good people, treat me right. Try to keep my space clean, leave them food now and again, and they do the same.  Bring in the mail for them, they bring mine.  It's good to see 'em, and I think they like my company as much as I like theirs.  Live in this big, cold, concrete sprawl, but it's folks like them that make me feel like I ain't done ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home sits on the edge of things. A suburb they call it, though it's more like a sprawl of uniformity, all neat lawns and matching houses. The air itself smells of fresh-cut grass and the faint tang of chlorine from the community pool.  A homeowner's association, they say, keeps things this way. Every house a cookie cutter, every yard a template. \n\nTwo-car garages line the streets, paved smooth like a racetrack. The driveways are short, the trees stunted, their branches reaching out like pleading fingers. There are no mailboxes, not the kind you see dotting the lawns of other places. Instead, they've corralled them all together, a cluster of metal boxes at the end of the street, each one keyed and guarded. \n\nThe houses, mostly one story, stand in neat rows, their roofs tilted towards the sun. There's a handful of two-story ones, like sentinels keeping watch over the rest.  A few miles out, the city bleeds into the farmland, a concrete river snaking its way through fields of corn and wheat. It's a place where retirees gather, their days measured out in walks and pool laps. Here and there, a young family, a couple with a dog, a flicker of something else amidst the stillness.\n\nThe city itself is large, but feels small, a place where you can walk down the street and know most of the faces. A single mall, not grand, but functional, sits at its heart, a beacon of consumerism. Drive fifteen minutes in any direction and you'll find a chain store, a familiar logo promising a taste of something else, something beyond the borders of this predictable place.",
            "The town sits low, a rust stain on the map just beyond the city's sprawling maw.  My corner of it, east side, wears the mark of hard times.  Houses lean tired, patched up, held together by hope and cheap paint.   Folks here, they're mostly salt of the earth, eyes that have seen too much sun and too little rain. A nod, a grunt, maybe a word or two when you pass. Crime ain't a stranger, though. A few years back, a boy from down the street, barely a man, got caught in some bad luck outside a bar.  Heard the shots, a hollow echo in the night.  Still, we lock our doors, keep our heads down, and hope for the best. The whole county's been choked by that dust cloud, the one they call the \"opioid epidemic.\"  Taken too many down, leaving empty chairs and broken dreams in its wake.  There's help, they say, places to mend the shattered soul, pills to fight the demons. But the scars stay.  \n\nMy son, he goes to the schoolhouse. Decent folks there, tryin' to build something good in a hard place.  He's got his own troubles, but they treat him kind. The schoolyard's a haven, a patch of green in a world gone gray.  See them folks gatherin' for bake sales, car washes, all to keep a roof over their heads and books in their hands.  Don't matter if your pockets are light, everyone's welcome at their table.  They even feed the kids, make sure no belly goes empty.  \n\nThe town itself, it's a patchwork of faded glory and stubborn hope.  The city fathers, they've spent their money fixin' up the streets downtown, where the shops and the crowds are.  But out here, on the east side, we're left to our own devices.  The streets are cracked, the houses creak, and the wind whispers stories of better days.  Still, there's a quiet strength here, a resilience born of hardship.  We make do, we hold on, and we dream of a tomorrow that might just be a little brighter.",
            "The city sets on a hill, a jumble of bricks and mortar, some of it breatheless with age.  My own place is a seven-story concrete hulk across from the old theater, a ghost of what it once was. Down a block, past the boarded windows and cracked sidewalks, is a bar, a refuge for the lost and the weary. In summer, the heat hangs thick and the line spills out onto the street, a tangle of bodies seeking solace in cheap beer and worn vinyl.  \n\nThree blocks up, the park. A patch of green in a sea of grey, enclosed by a wall of poured concrete, the steps leading up like the teeth of some forgotten beast. Winter comes hard, draining the life out of the city.  The wind bites, the rain falls in sheets, and the homeless make their home in the shadows, huddled close for warmth. Tents strung along the sidewalk, a chain of desperation against the cold. The city center, they say, is safer than the wilds. Closer to the soup kitchen, the place where they can wash the grime away. \n\nBut there's a beauty in this place, a raw, unflinching beauty. It ain't the buildings, though they stand proud, scarred by time and neglect. It's the people. Hilltop. Once a den of vipers, a place where the air itself tasted of violence. The government came sweeping in, DEA agents and their badge-bright smiles, trying to scrub clean the stain of sin. But the stories linger, passed down like whispered curses, a reminder of what was. The people here, they remember. They fight, tooth and nail, to keep the shadows at bay.\n\nThere are warnings, whispers about keeping to the light, about the dangers that lurk after dark.  They say a white girl shouldn't be out alone.  Maybe it's true. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's just a phantom of the past, a ghost story told to keep the fear alive. I walk these streets, heart pounding, eyes open, and I see kindness in the faces I meet. I see a hand offered, a jacket shared, a moment of connection in the cold embrace of the city.  Here, on the Hilltop, I feel alive.",
            "The land here stretches flat, a patchwork of fields yielding to towns stitched together by dusty roads.  No concrete canyons, no glittering glass and steel, just the slow churn of life under a vast sky. No franchise names to mark the way, no neon signs to pierce the quiet dusk. You drive for what you need, for everything. But the world opens up here, the water a constant presence. Lake Michigan, a grey-blue expanse stretching to the horizon, and Lake Charlevoix, a jewel of emerald green nestled close by.  Beaches, shallow and sandy, whisper at your feet.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's a tapestry woven with the threads of generations. Houses stand shoulder to shoulder, not in some regimented row but in a rambling dance of cedar shake and brick. Some bear the scars of time, their paint faded, their bones creaking, while others have been reborn, their faces scrubbed clean, their interiors gleaming. Most have basements, deep and dark, their concrete mouths yawning open to the road. Aluminum siding, the color of old pennies, glints in the sun. A riot of color splashes across the blocks, a testament to individuality in a land where sameness often reigns.\n\nYards, they're not just patches of green but extensions of home, filled with the laughter of children and the scent of freshly cut grass. Trampolines bounce, swings sway, and playsets creak with the weight of dreams. Gardens bloom, bursting forth with life, and fences hold the restless energy of dogs and chickens.\n\nThese are the people of the heartland, hardworking and weathered. They raise their families, tend their gardens, and watch their children run barefoot in the streets. The air hums with the rhythm of their lives: the clatter of evening dishes, the murmur of conversations on porches, the distant rumble of an engine plane taking flight.\n\nIt's not a place that shouts its beauty, but whispers it in the rustling leaves, the warmth of a neighbor's smile, the safe embrace of familiarity. It's a place where you can feel the pulse of the earth, the steady beat of a life lived close to the land. Here, at the edge of the world, you find something precious: a sense of belonging, a place to call home."
