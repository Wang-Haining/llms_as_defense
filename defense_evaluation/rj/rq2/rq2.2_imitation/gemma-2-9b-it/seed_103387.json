            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "The city sprawled. No rhythm to it. Houses and shops and offices huddled together, then scattered again. Some places you could find a meal, some a trinket. Big names and small shops, all vying for space. Malls choked with them, lining streets that were supposed to be quiet, if not for the constant hum of traffic. Parks, yes, those were there too, filled with children and their parents, a fleeting glimpse of innocence in the concrete heart.\n\nPeople. There were people everywhere. A tangle of tongues and customs. This corner, a pocket of rainbow flags and prayer shawls. A little further, the ghosts of a cold war still lingered, pale faces from a land lost. And then, scattered like forgotten prayers, Chinatown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, each a whisper of a homeland. But even a few miles could feel like a journey across an empty plain, trapped in the steel veins of traffic. Ten miles an hour, maybe two. Cars, a sea of them, a living thing that choked the breath from the city.\n\nThey built more and more, though. Towers scraping the sky, swallowing the light. More people, more cars. A hunger for space, a fear of emptiness. Houses too, some small, some grand, some crammed together like refugees. Duplexes, single-family homes, a tapestry of lives woven together. Faces I knew, faces I didn't. A childhood memory, playing with the next-door boy, a ghost of a simpler time. Now, strangers in the shadows of our own making.",
            "The houses stood in rows, mostly single-family, though some had been split in two, still joined at the hip like conjoined twins. Mine had a yard, a patch of dirt and weeds, and a drive that angled off to the left. It was a relic, a monument to a time when the suburbs were the promised land. A dream that once held them all, but now seemed to be drifting away. Still, the houses stood, a silent testament to a fading hope. \n\nThe people there weren't the same. The lawns were choked with weeds, the dreams dulled. The cars were still there, but fewer, and the kids played in the streets, oblivious to the world beyond. The schoolhouse, a brick behemoth, had stood for almost ninety years, a sentinel against time. It still cast its shadow on the young, a promise of something more, a whisper of what might be. The churches stood empty, their windows vacant eyes. But the basketball courts, they were always full, the echoes of the ball bouncing a rhythm against the silence.\n\nThe supermarket, \"Super A,\" was owned by a family from a far-off place, Yemen they called it. The only ones there not born of the land. Most were black, their faces etched with the story of a long and weary journey. The streets were wide, meant for cars, but the kids played their games, their laughter a defiant counterpoint to the rumble of engines.\n\nGenerations lived and died there. The old ones spoke of a time when everyone knew everyone else. A karate school had come and gone, a casualty of Hollywood's fickle whims. Now it was a pharmacy, dispensing pills for a world that had grown too weary. The movie theater, a relic of a bygone era, showed old films, a refuge for the elderly, their minds adrift in memories. The younger ones, they had no need for such things, their eyes fixed on the screens that flickered with the promises of a future they could never grasp.\n\nAn expressway cut through the town next door, a scar on the landscape, a reminder of the world that pushed its way in. They had tried to get an exit, a gateway to the outside, but the old ones, they had spoken against it, claiming it would ruin the town. The city council had listened, and the request was denied. Now they were building a new high school, a monument to the future, and the town was trying to choose a mascot, a symbol to represent them. A cyborg, a strange hybrid, with a country accent and a log cabin - a fitting symbol for a place caught between yesterday and tomorrow.",
            "You might miss it, passing by. Just another stretch of asphalt behind tired strip malls, a place where the sun bleeds out on cracked pavement and expectation fades. Not a place for dreaming, not for the kind of living folks whisper about. But past the rusted hulk of that old Whole Foods, behind the motels that only stir to life for a few weeks each year, families gathering like crows by a carcass, there’s another world. A string of apartment blocks huddled together, like matchsticks laid out by a child, each one a story waiting to be told. Some of them, the ones closest to the street, wear their history on their peeling paint and broken windows. News-talk whispers of trouble in those halls, things best left undisturbed. But past those shadows, past the vacant stares of the windows, are others. Places where light still finds its way in, where lives unfold beneath the thin veil of anonymity.\n\nAcross the road, the community college stands sentinel, a quiet grey thing against the endless blue. Students shuffle in, pale and bleary-eyed, clutching coffee like a lifeline against the morning. The iron gates groan open, admitting them one by one, their slow procession a thorn in the side of the impatient commuters.\n\nThe road forks, leading to a scene more familiar. A park, its grass a palette of sickly green, where children spin and leap, their laughter a sharp counterpoint to the low hum of the rehab center across the street. The air hangs heavy with the scent of chlorine and the promise of healing. On the porch, wicker chairs sit empty, swaying gently in the breeze, a promise of shade and quiet. \n\nA strip mall sprawls beside the park, a testament to the mundane rituals of survival. A sushi place, its neon sign flickering, promises cheap eats and greasy satisfaction. Next door, a swimming supply store, its shelves stocked with dreams of clear blue water. And between them, a nail salon, where chipped paint is reborn and stories are whispered between manicures. A frozen yogurt place, a beacon of sugar and artificial flavor, lures the teenagers from the park, their laughter echoing through the air as they chase the fleeting sweetness of youth.\n\nThis is America, a patchwork quilt of contradictions, where hope and despair coexist in a fragile balance. Time moves slowly here, measured by the heat of the sun and the slow crawl of cicadas.",
            "The road chewed on through the corn. Fields endless as the sky. \"Where's everything?\" she asked, the words thin in the air. I knew. Knew the shock would come, the city girl swallowed by the vastness. 5 minutes to the market, she said. Never seen this much empty. Told her about Ohio, about growing up where the air held the scent of dust and diesel.  A flicker in her eyes, a glimpse of understanding. \n\nDown a ribbon of blacktop, past a quarry filled with water like a black eye. There, nestled in the hills, the houses. Brick and stucco, each one a yard wide. Land, they call it. They take pride in it, in the neat rows of flowers that bloom in the spring, the trees that bleed color with the seasons. Driveways slick with Mercedes. Sun glistens off chrome, a mirror to the gold in the sky.\n\nMy house, grey stucco, sits at the end. Korean neighbor, always out there.  Mower hums, a song in the air. Old man, his face a map of years.  Lost some of his fire, but his eyes stay bright. Doctor once, he said. Now he blends with the grass, a green blur against the John Deere.\n\nGeese honking in the yard, our terrier barking at their shadows. Back, a creek whispers through the trees. Bullfrogs croak, and sometimes, a cow moos in the distance. A bridge, hand-hewn wood, leads to an island of green. Wildflowers, herbs, trees reaching for the sky. There, I built my world. Forts in the branches, hunted imaginary beasts. Seasons bled into each other, days long, filled with laughter and the smell of dust.\n\nWinter comes, a hard fist against the land. Green turns to grey. Trees stand stark, skeletons against the sky. Snow falls, a white shroud. My sister, snow angels and snowmen. We fought, built ice forts, hurled snowballs like shrapnel. In that white silence, we were kings, our own world hidden beneath the ice.",
            "The city of Portland. Call it what you will. Weird. They say so themselves, scrawled on some weathered brick beneath a neon sign that flickers over a place that serves pizzas by day, whiskey by night. Music spills out, a murmur of bass and drums, and the stories whispered in the shadows speak of a wilder time, a time before the gold rush came and the Californians spilled in, seeking some elusive piece of the strange.  \n\nThey call it \"Keep Portland Weird,\" a mantra etched in graffiti on alley walls, a prayer on the lips of those who fear the encroaching tide of normalcy.  But what's weird? Is it the man who sells you hand-painted shoes on a street corner? Or the woman who practices yoga with goats on a patch of grass?  Maybe it's the cardboard boxes stacked like offerings on the sidewalk, filled with cast-off dreams and forgotten treasures.\n\nPortland is a place where contradictions live side by side. It's a city of hipsters and businessmen, of rain-soaked streets and blooming gardens. It's a city where you can buy a yoga mat and a heroin needle on the same block. It's a city where the air is thick with the scent of rain and regret, but also with the faint, sweet smell of hope.\n\nThey say Portland has a problem. They say it's a city of addicts and the downtrodden, a city where shadows lengthen and darkness lingers. And maybe that's true. But in its darkness, there's a kind of beauty, a melancholic poetry that speaks to the soul.\n\nPortland is a city that doesn't apologize for being different. It's a city that embraces its flaws and celebrates its oddities. And in that, perhaps, lies its true weirdness.",
            "The mountains. They were there. Always. Northward, stoic sentinels to the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawn. Dusk. It mattered little. Even lost in the churn of work, the city's clamor, they stood, unyielding. A presence. A weight. When the mind frayed, when the soul wound tight, they called.  Turned toward them, the knot eased. A lending of strength, a breath.  \n\nIt was here, at the foot of those mountains, that I first stood. Undergrad years. The university, its brick and leaf and pond, held a certain charm. But it was the mountains that claimed the throne. The north. \n\nThe town, it had its own kind of beauty. Cafés, dark and smelling of burnt coffee, where nights bled into days. A walk, a bus ride, and the downtown pressed in, a brick-red husk of a city past, its windows like vacant eyes. A kind of energy thrummed there, a pulse. But it was a heartbeat quickly swallowed by the quiet hum of the suburbs. The library stood as a boundary, a line drawn in the sand. A dichotomy. City and quiet. \n\nMemories clung to this place. The rusted swings in the park, companions after sleepless nights. The downtown crush, a blur of faces, a mad dash to the movie house. But the memories weren't all bright. The ponds, still and dark, held their own sorrows. Tears shed in the stillness, a reflection of a soul adrift. I watched the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each with their purpose. A stark contrast to the questions that churned within.\n\nI walked. Past the pond, past the houses, past the park, until the street stretched before me. The sun, a blaze of gold and fire, poured over the palm trees. Northward. Always north. The mountains, a jagged line against the sky, an unspoken promise. A reminder. To keep going.",
            "If you find yourself headed to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't be lost. The iron horse runs through it, a familiar beast in this concrete jungle.  This ain't no rural backwater. It's New York, through and through. But there's a different kind of life here.  A tide of Asian faces, new and old, has washed over these streets.  Every block, it seems, holds a store bearing the mark of their commerce - supermarkets piled high with unfamiliar goods, laundromats humming with the constant spin of endless clothes. The locals swear by them, say the food's good, the prices right, and the convenience can't be beat. I myself could walk two minutes in any direction and find myself before four of these places.  It's a grocery shopper's paradise.\n\nBut don't think Bensonhurst is a monolith. It's a quilt, stitched together with threads of every color. Immigrants and their children, born here or brought here, walk these streets.  The big businesses, though, they often bear the same mark as the shops. \n\nThere's a park nearby, newly refurbished, with courts for basketball and hand ball, a field for kicking a ball around, swings for the young'uns, and a fountain that spits water like a dragon. It's a microcosm of the city itself, a tapestry of faces under a single sky. \n\nNo towering office blocks here, not like the steel skeletons downtown.  Most are modest brick row houses, two families under one roof.  The people, they're a mix. Kind enough, but loud.  The rumble of cars, the boom of their radios, it's a constant soundtrack to the day.  You'll wake up to the roar of engines, the smell of exhaust in the air.  As night falls, though, you gotta keep your eyes open.  It's a safe place, mostly, but there's darkness in everyone.  The occasional bully, the desperate hand reaching for what isn't theirs. I've seen it myself, felt it.  A shove, a threat, a reminder that the city never sleeps, and neither do its shadows.\n\nAnd the dogs. Don't get me started on the dogs. The city's got rules about leashes, about cleaning up after them, but here, those rules are whispers in the wind.  Every morning, it's a minefield of dog shit on the sidewalk.  Watch your step, or you'll be stepping in it.",
            "The streets here run downhill, all of them. My house sits atop the steepest rise, the one the runners call their workout.  No sidewalks grace these parts, so the road is the path.  Pocked and uneven, it's a hazard for wheels.  The wires strung above, telephone and power, hang tattered and patched.  The rain falls hard here, the wind a constant companion. Branches snap, lines go down, and they mend them in a kind of ragged patchwork.  \n\nEvergreens crowd the landscape, a dark army, but the people here hate them. They want the view, the ocean, and cut the trees down with a blind, desperate fervor.  Houses rise up then, glass boxes clawing at the sky, each one hungry for the glimpse of water.  Sunsets, when they come, are a blaze of orange, the water lit from below. But the clouds are thick, a shroud more often than not, the sun a ghost behind the haze.  Damp is the air, the constant companion of the moss that crawls on everything.  Roofs, cars, even railings, all succumb to its green embrace. I left my car in the drive once, a month gone by, and when I came back it was a forest of green, furry and thick. Took three hours to scrape it all away.\n\nChildren are scarce, though the school stands nearby, a lonely sentinel.  Older folk mostly, retired, their lives a slow tide ebbing towards something unseen.  Dogs are their children, they run loose, their barks echoing in the streets.  Leave a window open, and you might find one curled up in your living room, a furry ghost in the empty spaces. \n\nRabbits scatter, fat and bold, a plague to the gardeners who curse their digging ways.  My cats, they see them as prey, and the neighborhood has grown quiet of the twitching noses and white tails.  Birds flit about, sparrows, hummingbirds, now and then a hawk or an eagle, a fleeting shadow against the clouds, until the crows, their harsh cries a warning, drive it away.\n\nNo shops here, only the restaurants by the water, their windows filled with glistening fish.  The beach is a sliver of sand, the rocks at the edge more appealing, good for throwing into the depths. The bay itself is narrow, the opposite shore a clear line even through the mist.",
            "The house squats at the corner, a sentinel on the edge of the woods. Two state highways bleed into this street, a ribbon of asphalt cutting through the quiet. Cars pass, a constant murmur on the wind. Folks here keep to themselves, tending their yards, their lives a tapestry of small routines. Winter brings a flurry of activity, children shrieking as they slide down the hill, their laughter echoing off the clapboard houses. We see them all, these faces, these fleeting glimpses into lives lived just beyond our own. A stranger's car, a new face at the mailbox - these are the things that mark the passing of time.\n\nThere are four of us here. Wife, daughters, and me.  The younger one, eleven. The older, fourteen. We work from home, these days. A blur of mornings, afternoons, evenings spent within these walls. But we carve out time for the outside.  \n\nWe play in the rain, sometimes. The smell of barbecue smoke hangs heavy in the summer air, a reminder that life, even in this quiet place, is a slow, steady burn. The lawnmowers begin their mournful song come March, and echo through the long, hot days until the grass finally yields to the coming cold.  Trees, sentinels themselves, stand guard over this place, their leaves a carpet of gold and red in the fall. They burn with a sweet, acrid smell that signals the end of summer's reign.\n\nThese days, winter seems a whisper, a distant memory. Just a long, lingering fall. We seldom use the front door, the garage at the back of the house our haven. When the doors are open, I feel a kinship with the street, the rhythm of the neighborhood pulsing through me. Holidays bring a brief flurry of activity, cars spilling onto the street like spilled ink.  Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas - fleeting moments of connection in a sea of quiet.  \n\nIt's a good place to live. If only the traffic would ease.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust. Dust everywhere. A bleached bone stretched flat beneath a sun that never relents. You don't know brown till you've seen it this way. A patch of green? That's a man's fortune laid bare in water and chemicals. Back in the 90s, houses were strung out like lonely tumbleweeds. Now, they crowd closer, new ones pushing up like weeds. The city's creeping in, swallowing the bones of the land. It's the way of things these days.  Most folks are decent enough. A scattering of kindness in this harsh landscape. But like cities, there's a darkness too.  Old folks here, mostly. A quiet kind of folks. Maybe that's why it feels less like a city, more like a slow breath held.\n\nThe stores are the same chains, the same faces. Food for Less, Smart & Final. For real food, you gotta drive. Whole Foods? Never seen one.\n\nConstruction's the lifeblood here, or at least it feels that way. The land's still raw, waiting to be carved up. It scares me, that spreading. They keep building, swallowing up the spaces that are left. I came here to escape the city, and I don't want to go back.\n\nI work with my hands, drywall and T-bars. It's honest work.\n\nThere's a kind of beauty here, a starkness that can take your breath away. The creatures that live here, the lizards skittering in the dust, the bugs that burrow in the sand. My kids, they love them. I see them out there now, chasing shadows in the heat, nets in hand.\n\nPeople come for the desert. They come for the quiet. The wide open spaces. We have our fairs, our museums, our little pieces of history. You can find a slice of something different here. But if you come, remember the desert's a living thing. Treat it with respect.",
            "The question asks for a neighborhood. Mine ain't like the others. No picket fences or yardsawdust. Mine's the campus, a stone's throw from the dorms. The buildings, they're the houses, these boxy monoliths holding onto the dreams of a hundred souls. Apartments, some stacked two stories high, hold maybe twenty souls each. Four to a room, maybe less. Then there are the houses, the few scattered about, rented out to the ghosts of alumni, the ones who still linger. And the dorms, those sprawling hives of young blood, a hundred students sharing thin walls and thinner dreams. \n\nThe people, they're a tapestry woven from every thread of the world. Old and young, black and white, the shades in between. The staff, they stay in the houses, keepers of the secrets whispered in the halls. The students, they roam the dorms, their voices a cacophony of ambition and fear. \n\nThe stores, they line the paths, offering sustenance and trinkets. Food, books, clothes, all the necessities for a life lived in the shadow of academia. And the park, a small patch of green, a haven amidst the concrete. The wind whispers through the trees, a constant reminder of the world beyond these walls.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  A decade spent under this sky, learning the lay of the land. I came here from Riverdale, a place of memory and loss.  Tears fell then, for what was left behind, for the ghosts of laughter in empty rooms.  They said it was for the best, my folks. Stockbridge. A better life. Shiny new schools, houses with lawns that didn't whisper of neglect. A clean slate. It took time, though, to make this place feel less like a stranger's doorstep and more like home.  Friends were made, some forged in fire, some fleeting as smoke. Neighbors, mostly faces in passing, shadows on the porch steps. Except for Mr. Glen and his kin. They had a way of pulling you in, a warmth that felt like family.  Remember his wedding? A second chance, a second bloom.  We danced,  the music a heartbeat in the night. I caught a stray ribbon, Ms. Veda's,  a white sliver of silk against the darkness.  Couldn't catch the flowers, though.  There's a girl, Marsharii, one of their daughters.  We talked, laughed, under the porch lights. I haven't seen her since.  Hope she's found her own way.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a labyrinth, a web of streets twisting and turning. I used to get lost, but now I have a guide, a metal box that speaks.  I still haven't seen it all, haven't explored every corner.  Kason and Curtis, they know these streets like the back of their hands. We used to play,  games with pixels and controllers, living vicariously through the heroes on the screen.  Sometimes, I'd steal away to the park.  The trees, the rustle of leaves, the silence that speaks volumes. It stills the mind, calms the restless soul.  I'd bring sticks, practice balance, wield a wooden sword.  A samurai without a war, but a warrior nonetheless.  There's a basketball court, a tennis court.  My father, he taught me tennis, with Mr. Graves.  We bled sweat and laughter under the summer sun.  They pushed us,  made us stronger. \n\nThere's a hundred stories in this place, a thousand whispers in the wind.  But these are the ones that echo in my heart.  These are the threads that weave the tapestry of my time here.  And I know, with a certainty that settles deep in my bones, that the best story is yet to be written.",
            "The college squats a stone's throw from where I make my meager bed. A neighborhood of brick and mortar, mostly apartments, with a few greasy spoons and dive bars clinging to the edges. One of the bars, rechristened just last fall, bleeds greenbacks now. The drinks are the same rotgut, the service as slow, though.  Folks around here, mostly young and restless, or worn down by the grind. The apartments, they're cheap enough for them, and there's a schoolhouse nearby, a gaggle of small children spilling out each day. I don't know my neighbors, and truth be told, I don't much care to. The smell of something sickly sweet hangs heavy in the air, a chemical balm masking the haze rising from their doorways. They smoke, you see, a lot of it. The building's management, they've tried to fight it, with an air freshener unit like a pathetic monument to futility. \n\nThe buildings themselves, they're old, bones showing through the paint. Some have been patched up inside, but the spirit of decay lingers. Down the road a ways, new blood money has risen, glassy towers built too tall, too fast. Cheap labor, cheap materials, and a price tag to match. They bleed the students dry, these new places.  There's a diner a few blocks over, serving slop on paper plates, warmed in the belly of a microwave. Across the street, a gas station, where the air smells of fuel and despair. The street's been paved over, a city project, trees trimmed back to expose the ugliness beneath. But my street, it's shrouded in shadow. A line of trees mark the edge of the city, a wall of green against the concrete. Behind my building, another set of apartments, the kind where trouble sleeps on the porch. Forty-second Street, they call it. Forty-third Street, just behind, is where the shadows deepen. The sidewalks crumble, the buildings sag, hiding their secrets behind a curtain of leaves.  \n\nCrime, it's a whispered word, a ghost that haunts these streets. One building, more than others, bears the scars. But the rot, it spreads. Apartments across the street, they too hold their share of darkness. Yet, here I stay, for the rent is low and the college is a walk away. Two bus stops, they offer a lifeline to the outside world. I make do, I survive. It's not much, but it's home.",
            "The houses squat on this cul-de-sac, duplexes paired off like lonely twins.  Spaced so as to mimic individuality, each one a pale yellow sun against the green of the roofs and white bones of their porches. Most of them know each other, these folks, though some stand aloof, their windows shut tight against the world.  Evenings find us gathered at the edge of driveways, words spilling out like water over parched ground while the young ones chase after their toys, their laughter echoing in the stillness. A slowness here, a respite from the machine hum that deafens the rest of the world.  A breath held for a moment in time. The fields stretch out, a green sea dotted with trees, the sky a canvas of blue stretched taut above. But the sky can turn quick. This season, the warnings have come more often, the sirens a low growl in the distance. Last night, the growl became a scream. We took cover. Me, the little dog nestled against my side, my purse clutched tight beside a few pillows. The big one, he didn't trust the darkness, paced the living room, a low whine rumbling in his chest. The hail fell, a thousand tiny hammers against the roof, the air thick and cold. The road, it steamed after the storm, the temperature shifting like a ghost. The sun peeked out, a sliver of gold behind the clouds, and the rain began to fall, a curtain of silver, then two arcs of fire painted across the sky. A double rainbow. I snatched my camera, a frantic heartbeat against my ribs, and captured the moment,  a fleeting beauty to share with those beyond this place.  The quiet lingered for a time, then the familiar sounds returned - the rumble of a truck, the laughter of children, the quiet murmur of conversation. Life resumed, a slow, steady pulse. I'm a stranger here, just a girl from up north, drawn to the slow drawl of their voices, the kindness in their eyes. Two rooms, two baths, that's what they all have. But inside, the stories unfold, whispered secrets in the shadows. I walk the fields behind these houses, the air thick with the scent of earth and dew. A pond lies still, its surface a mirror to the sky. Deer move silently through the tall grass, and the bullfrog sings his mournful song each morning. Forty minutes from the city, a world away. Roosters crow, a chorus of welcome each day. A small village, hidden in the heart of the fields, where the donkey brays its evening song.  A lucky find, this place.",
            "The dust settled on the street the same day I walked into eighth grade. Hard to make kin in this place at first, but I found solace in the company of two boys. One lived two houses down, the other just up the street. Both gone now, but the ghosts of their laughter still linger in the air. Some of the faces haven't changed, though. The same houses stand, two stories high, windows like vacant eyes staring down the quiet avenues. \n\nWeekends bleed into each other, sun-drenched afternoons filled with the shrieks of children chasing shadows. The air is thick with the scent of cut grass and something else, something unspoken, something that settles in your bones. It's a quiet place, this neighborhood. You're left to your own devices, but if you need help, a hand will reach out. Packages delivered safe and sound, no pilfered trinkets from porches. Trust, it's a fragile thing, and here, it seems to hold.\n\nThe park, it's a heartbeat away, a patch of green where memories bloom and fade. I ran with those boys there, basketballs bouncing, pigskin flying.  A football slammed against my nose, a jarring symphony of pain, but the echoes of laughter drown out the hurt. Now, it's the laughter of younger cousins, their small hands gripping swings, their eyes bright with the joy of a world unburdened by years.\n\nA kaleidoscope of sounds and smells, this neighborhood. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - a tapestry woven from the threads of a thousand stories. Food, it's a language spoken here, a language of comfort and belonging. But even the finest cuisine can't compete with a craving for the familiar. The greasy scent of fast food, it's a siren song, a promise of convenience. Pizza, a universal language, its warmth spreading through the belly like a comforting embrace.\n\nWalgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco - the familiar names stand sentinel, offering a promise of everything you might need. Dry cleaners hum with the quiet industry of mending and mending. An Indian store, a beacon of spices and stories, a reminder that the world is vast and wondrous.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's a haven, a refuge from the storm. I read the stories, hear the whispers of despair, and count my blessings.",
            "The town. Small. Tucked away. South Carolina dust.  Peach Capital. A sign proclaims it so, though the peaches themselves ain't much to brag about. Fields stretch out, endless rows of trees heavy with fruit or cows fattening in the sun. Houses scattered, two stories mostly, metal roofs glinting like scars in the heat.  Far back from the road, set in the fields.  One stoplight in the center, a solitary sentinel. There, the stores huddle.  Hong Kong, a family's haven of chow mein and wonton soup. Fiesta, where the burritos are the size of your head. Gary's. Burgers. Used to be a pizza place, but that went belly up a while back. \n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, a little box with a window that smells of cherry cola. That's what they're known for, that sweet, bottled memory.  IGA.  Small.  Expensive. Folks go to Batesburg-Leesville for their groceries, a pilgrimage to the big box stores.  Dollar General. That's where the real lifeblood goes. Everything you need, all under one roof. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More.  A woman runs it, kind eyes and a tired smile. She remembers folks, knows their stories.  Attached, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Dogs barking, the scent of shampoo and fear. The doctor, the vet, out on the edge of town. Small practices, but they do what they can.\n\nJohnston Elementary.  Fifth grade, and then it's time to leave. \n\nNo parks. Not really.  But they're building something. A patch of green, a place for kids to run. \n\nNot much else.  No movies, no bowling, no places to linger. Just the quiet hum of life.  A town you might miss, if you blink too fast.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place, it was on some podcast about vanishings. Folk disappearing into thin air. Strange, considering the rents. A thousand a month easy, every damned shack. Never heard a whisper of it, neither had my kin. Maybe that's the struggle. I know a few who weep themselves to sleep at night. Things tight, they are. But we've learned to live cheap. Dusty smell of flea market toys, moth-eaten clothes. That's the scent of survival. You smell less, as a man. You might take up smoke, or maybe you just grow used to the stink. But the flea market lingers. Adulthood smells like dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It gets in the leather and ain't washed out easy. Three thrift stores within walking distance, here. Start on the far side, you can hit two charity joints, a library, a book shop, and a curio shop. Downtown's a boilin' pot, cars and people squarin' off in the streets every mornin', but inside the stores, silence.  Doesn't matter how many souls or engines rumble past, the stores hold their breath. A good place to lose an afternoon, that's for sure. And every year, more and more of them come. Cars and people, floodin' in. A growin' city, they say. Headquartered for one of them online empires, e-commerce and deliveries, still got its growing pains. Reminds me of New York, in a way. Everyone's got their own compass, pointin' to their own damn goal. Ain't much anyone asks of you. You can be alone, quiet, your own man, and they'll leave you be. Not like back South, where a little concern means you give a damn.  Ain't nobody pryin' into your life here. Keep your shell on, as long as you please, and the city'll crash and roll back like waves on the shore. A lively place, it is.  Between the pianist next door and them two amateur singers upstairs, there's always somethin' goin' on. We ain't so much strangers in an apartment building, more like a community of friends. Come together for need, for birthdays, for funerals, for helpin' each other out when we can. Lucky to be here, I reckon. Like most of my neighbors, and they treat me right. I try to keep my space clean, leave them food now and then, and they do the same. Bring their mail in, they bring mine. Good to see their faces, and I believe they like my company, just as much as I theirs. Live in this big, cold, unforgiving sprawl, but it's folks like my neighbors that make me feel like maybe I didn't screw my life up too bad.",
            "The place I call home. A suburb of a kind. These cookie-cutter houses all parade in a line, each one a testament to the iron fist of the homeowner's association.  Every yard a sterile tableau: a patch of green, a scattering of stones, driveways short and clipped. Trees, if you're lucky, stand sentinel in the corners. Two car garages, each a metal maw swallowing the metal beasts within. The streets, newly poured and gleaming, snake through the sameness, a testament to the collective will of the residents. No potholes mar the surface, no wounds in the asphalt skin. Mostly single stories these houses are, though a few dare to reach for the sky, two stories high. No quaint mailboxes stand before each door. Instead, a communal cluster awaits at the street's end, a row of metal cages each holding a promise of letters and bills.  Larger lockers stand guard for packages, reminders of the world beyond this ordered realm.\n\nOut here, on the edge of the city, the suburb bleeds into the fields, a ribbon of pavement weaving through scrub and grass. More land, more space, a concession to the sprawling nature of this place. Pools shimmer in the heat, guarded gates promising a watery escape. Walking trails wind through the green, paths for those who seek solace in the rustle of leaves and the chirp of crickets. No need for parks here, the neighborhood itself is a sprawling green lung. \n\nMostly, retired folks fill these houses, faces etched with the lines of time and experience. A sense of watchful peace hangs in the air, a unspoken agreement to keep each other safe. But young blood lingers too, a few families with children, a sprinkling of professionals, their footsteps echoing the city's distant hum. \n\nThe city itself is a beast, large and teeming, yet somehow holding onto a quaintness that defies its size. A single mall, not a behemoth, but enough to satisfy the cravings of the masses. Fifteen minutes on the road and the world opens up, a buffet of stores offering everything from organic kale to bargain-basement socks.",
            "The town sits low in the valley, a breath beyond the edge of the city's sprawl. My part, east side, runs ragged. Houses lean, paint peeled like sunburnt skin. Renters mostly, or folks scraping by. But there's a kind of quiet dignity here. Neighbors wave, porch light smiles on a dusk walk.  Not a bad place, not for the want of trying. Papers say the crime's a shade higher, but that's a whisper compared to the dark hum of the city. Still, a shot rings out every now and then, a ghost in the stillness. A boy, a neighbor's boy, gone last year, outside a bar on the edge of town. Found in the street, light flickering out. We've been lucky, spared the worst. A busted window here, a package gone there, a reminder that the world bleeds in even the quietest corners.\n\nThe opioid wind whips through these parts, a sickness that took root deep. Fentanyl, they call it. The reaper in a pill bottle. Faces you see in the grocery line, hollowed out, lost. But there are lights in the darkness, too. A center here, a hand reaching out. Narcan, they say, a chance to hold on. \n\nThe school, though, that's a haven. My son, he's blessed, a different kind of broken but they treat him like gold. The teachers, their hearts are big as the sky. They know every child's name, every ache. Even the poorest kid at school gets a full belly, a hot plate in their hands. No shame, no judgment. Just kindness. The town's face is a patchwork, the center bright and shiny, new shops and paved streets. But out here, on the edge, the paint peels, the cracks widen. Still, we're home. Sixteen years, and I can't imagine leaving.  There's a hard beauty in the dust, a quiet strength in the bones of this place.",
            "The Hill held the bones of a history not so sweet.  Seven stories high, my building stood across from the old theater, a hulking presence against the dusk. A block down, the arcade bar pulsed with a dim light, drawing in a motley crew on summer nights. Lines snaked out the door, a testament to the fleeting joy it offered. Just up the incline, the city park sprawled, a patch of green swallowed by concrete. Steps, tall and unforgiving, were poured into the wall, leading nowhere. In the winter's grip, the homeless made their shelter there, a row of tents huddled against the cold. Rain was their constant companion, lashing down in sheets, making warmth a luxury. Better to be close, they figured, within reach of the family center, their refuge from the elements.\n\nBut the Hill wasn't about the buildings, not really. It was about the people.  They carried the echoes of a past steeped in violence, a time when the Feds came sweeping in, a mechanized tide against the tide of gangs. Stories lingered like dust motes, whispered from generation to generation, a reminder of a darkness that never truly fades. They worked hard, these people, to keep the Hill clean, to hold onto some semblance of order. They warned you, the white folks, not to walk these streets after dark. An old fear, a ghost story. Maybe I walked with a darkness in my own skin, or maybe they saw a flicker of their own resilience in me.\n\nBut the Hilltop was a crucible. It burned away the easy assumptions, the comfortable lies. It showed you the ugly truth of racism, of fear twisting itself into prejudice. It was a melting pot, sure, but the heat was fierce, and the edges were sharp.  \n\nNo matter where I went, I knew I'd always carry the Hilltop with me. The streets pulsed with a life that sang in your bones.  A kindness that bloomed in the most unexpected places, a jacket offered, a phone charged, a hand reaching out with a five dollar bill and a whispered affirmation. It was a place where you were seen, not just tolerated. It was home.",
            "The land here stretches out flat, a canvas of corn and sky.  The towns are small, strung along the edges like beads on a fading string.  No city's steel and glass, no monoliths of commerce. No chain ghosts of Applebee's or Wal-Mart. Everything's a drive. Still, the water holds the world in its embrace. Lake Michigan, vast and brooding, to the west. Lake Charlevoix, smaller but no less fierce, to the east. The shore is always near, a line of sand where you can brush the cold fingers of the lake.\n\nThe houses here are like old bones, weathered and worn. Some patched and painted, some left to the elements. Basements, deep and dark, yawn open beneath them. Aluminum siding, the color of a faded sunset, clings to many.  A patchwork quilt of hues, the houses stand in their yards, each a testament to lives lived, children raised. Trampolines, swings, the rusted ghosts of playsets. Gardens bursting with life, fences holding back the wandering creatures.\n\nHard work etched in every line, every calloused hand. Families, roots dug deep. Children run barefoot on the cracked asphalt, laughter echoing in the stillness. Dogs bark greetings, their tails wagging promises. Neighbors wave, a silent acknowledgment of shared space.  The lawns are neat, trimmed and cared for. No piles of fallen leaves, no untamed wilderness. Here, order reigns. \n\nIt's not a place of ostentatious beauty, but a quiet kind of peace. A place where you can learn the names of your neighbors, where trust is thicker than the summer air. The sheriff's station sits like a sentinel at the edge of town, the jail its shadow. The health department, a beacon of hope. The recycling center hums with the quiet industry of renewal. A symphony of shouts and cheers rises from the baseball field, the drone of small planes a constant reminder of the world beyond.\n\nThe air is sweet with the scent of freshly cut grass and the promise of a summer storm. The ice cream shop calls with its siren song of sweetness.  A walk to the park, a shortcut through the trees. This is not just a place to live, it's a place to belong."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "The city sprawled. No rhythm to it. Houses and shops and offices huddled together, then scattered again. Some places you could find a meal, some a trinket. Big names and small shops, all vying for space. Malls choked with them, lining streets that were supposed to be quiet, if not for the constant hum of traffic. Parks, yes, those were there too, filled with children and their parents, a fleeting glimpse of innocence in the concrete heart.\n\nPeople. There were people everywhere. A tangle of tongues and customs. This corner, a pocket of rainbow flags and prayer shawls. A little further, the ghosts of a cold war still lingered, pale faces from a land lost. And then, scattered like forgotten prayers, Chinatown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, each a whisper of a homeland. But even a few miles could feel like a journey across an empty plain, trapped in the steel veins of traffic. Ten miles an hour, maybe two. Cars, a sea of them, a living thing that choked the breath from the city.\n\nThey built more and more, though. Towers scraping the sky, swallowing the light. More people, more cars. A hunger for space, a fear of emptiness. Houses too, some small, some grand, some crammed together like refugees. Duplexes, single-family homes, a tapestry of lives woven together. Faces I knew, faces I didn't. A childhood memory, playing with the next-door boy, a ghost of a simpler time. Now, strangers in the shadows of our own making.",
            "The houses stood in rows, mostly single-family, though some had been split in two, still joined at the hip like conjoined twins. Mine had a yard, a patch of dirt and weeds, and a drive that angled off to the left. It was a relic, a monument to a time when the suburbs were the promised land. A dream that once held them all, but now seemed to be drifting away. Still, the houses stood, a silent testament to a fading hope. \n\nThe people there weren't the same. The lawns were choked with weeds, the dreams dulled. The cars were still there, but fewer, and the kids played in the streets, oblivious to the world beyond. The schoolhouse, a brick behemoth, had stood for almost ninety years, a sentinel against time. It still cast its shadow on the young, a promise of something more, a whisper of what might be. The churches stood empty, their windows vacant eyes. But the basketball courts, they were always full, the echoes of the ball bouncing a rhythm against the silence.\n\nThe supermarket, \"Super A,\" was owned by a family from a far-off place, Yemen they called it. The only ones there not born of the land. Most were black, their faces etched with the story of a long and weary journey. The streets were wide, meant for cars, but the kids played their games, their laughter a defiant counterpoint to the rumble of engines.\n\nGenerations lived and died there. The old ones spoke of a time when everyone knew everyone else. A karate school had come and gone, a casualty of Hollywood's fickle whims. Now it was a pharmacy, dispensing pills for a world that had grown too weary. The movie theater, a relic of a bygone era, showed old films, a refuge for the elderly, their minds adrift in memories. The younger ones, they had no need for such things, their eyes fixed on the screens that flickered with the promises of a future they could never grasp.\n\nAn expressway cut through the town next door, a scar on the landscape, a reminder of the world that pushed its way in. They had tried to get an exit, a gateway to the outside, but the old ones, they had spoken against it, claiming it would ruin the town. The city council had listened, and the request was denied. Now they were building a new high school, a monument to the future, and the town was trying to choose a mascot, a symbol to represent them. A cyborg, a strange hybrid, with a country accent and a log cabin - a fitting symbol for a place caught between yesterday and tomorrow.",
            "You might miss it, passing by. Just another stretch of asphalt behind tired strip malls, a place where the sun bleeds out on cracked pavement and expectation fades. Not a place for dreaming, not for the kind of living folks whisper about. But past the rusted hulk of that old Whole Foods, behind the motels that only stir to life for a few weeks each year, families gathering like crows by a carcass, there’s another world. A string of apartment blocks huddled together, like matchsticks laid out by a child, each one a story waiting to be told. Some of them, the ones closest to the street, wear their history on their peeling paint and broken windows. News-talk whispers of trouble in those halls, things best left undisturbed. But past those shadows, past the vacant stares of the windows, are others. Places where light still finds its way in, where lives unfold beneath the thin veil of anonymity.\n\nAcross the road, the community college stands sentinel, a quiet grey thing against the endless blue. Students shuffle in, pale and bleary-eyed, clutching coffee like a lifeline against the morning. The iron gates groan open, admitting them one by one, their slow procession a thorn in the side of the impatient commuters.\n\nThe road forks, leading to a scene more familiar. A park, its grass a palette of sickly green, where children spin and leap, their laughter a sharp counterpoint to the low hum of the rehab center across the street. The air hangs heavy with the scent of chlorine and the promise of healing. On the porch, wicker chairs sit empty, swaying gently in the breeze, a promise of shade and quiet. \n\nA strip mall sprawls beside the park, a testament to the mundane rituals of survival. A sushi place, its neon sign flickering, promises cheap eats and greasy satisfaction. Next door, a swimming supply store, its shelves stocked with dreams of clear blue water. And between them, a nail salon, where chipped paint is reborn and stories are whispered between manicures. A frozen yogurt place, a beacon of sugar and artificial flavor, lures the teenagers from the park, their laughter echoing through the air as they chase the fleeting sweetness of youth.\n\nThis is America, a patchwork quilt of contradictions, where hope and despair coexist in a fragile balance. Time moves slowly here, measured by the heat of the sun and the slow crawl of cicadas.",
            "The road chewed on through the corn. Fields endless as the sky. \"Where's everything?\" she asked, the words thin in the air. I knew. Knew the shock would come, the city girl swallowed by the vastness. 5 minutes to the market, she said. Never seen this much empty. Told her about Ohio, about growing up where the air held the scent of dust and diesel.  A flicker in her eyes, a glimpse of understanding. \n\nDown a ribbon of blacktop, past a quarry filled with water like a black eye. There, nestled in the hills, the houses. Brick and stucco, each one a yard wide. Land, they call it. They take pride in it, in the neat rows of flowers that bloom in the spring, the trees that bleed color with the seasons. Driveways slick with Mercedes. Sun glistens off chrome, a mirror to the gold in the sky.\n\nMy house, grey stucco, sits at the end. Korean neighbor, always out there.  Mower hums, a song in the air. Old man, his face a map of years.  Lost some of his fire, but his eyes stay bright. Doctor once, he said. Now he blends with the grass, a green blur against the John Deere.\n\nGeese honking in the yard, our terrier barking at their shadows. Back, a creek whispers through the trees. Bullfrogs croak, and sometimes, a cow moos in the distance. A bridge, hand-hewn wood, leads to an island of green. Wildflowers, herbs, trees reaching for the sky. There, I built my world. Forts in the branches, hunted imaginary beasts. Seasons bled into each other, days long, filled with laughter and the smell of dust.\n\nWinter comes, a hard fist against the land. Green turns to grey. Trees stand stark, skeletons against the sky. Snow falls, a white shroud. My sister, snow angels and snowmen. We fought, built ice forts, hurled snowballs like shrapnel. In that white silence, we were kings, our own world hidden beneath the ice.",
            "The city of Portland. Call it what you will. Weird. They say so themselves, scrawled on some weathered brick beneath a neon sign that flickers over a place that serves pizzas by day, whiskey by night. Music spills out, a murmur of bass and drums, and the stories whispered in the shadows speak of a wilder time, a time before the gold rush came and the Californians spilled in, seeking some elusive piece of the strange.  \n\nThey call it \"Keep Portland Weird,\" a mantra etched in graffiti on alley walls, a prayer on the lips of those who fear the encroaching tide of normalcy.  But what's weird? Is it the man who sells you hand-painted shoes on a street corner? Or the woman who practices yoga with goats on a patch of grass?  Maybe it's the cardboard boxes stacked like offerings on the sidewalk, filled with cast-off dreams and forgotten treasures.\n\nPortland is a place where contradictions live side by side. It's a city of hipsters and businessmen, of rain-soaked streets and blooming gardens. It's a city where you can buy a yoga mat and a heroin needle on the same block. It's a city where the air is thick with the scent of rain and regret, but also with the faint, sweet smell of hope.\n\nThey say Portland has a problem. They say it's a city of addicts and the downtrodden, a city where shadows lengthen and darkness lingers. And maybe that's true. But in its darkness, there's a kind of beauty, a melancholic poetry that speaks to the soul.\n\nPortland is a city that doesn't apologize for being different. It's a city that embraces its flaws and celebrates its oddities. And in that, perhaps, lies its true weirdness.",
            "The mountains. They were there. Always. Northward, stoic sentinels to the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawn. Dusk. It mattered little. Even lost in the churn of work, the city's clamor, they stood, unyielding. A presence. A weight. When the mind frayed, when the soul wound tight, they called.  Turned toward them, the knot eased. A lending of strength, a breath.  \n\nIt was here, at the foot of those mountains, that I first stood. Undergrad years. The university, its brick and leaf and pond, held a certain charm. But it was the mountains that claimed the throne. The north. \n\nThe town, it had its own kind of beauty. Cafés, dark and smelling of burnt coffee, where nights bled into days. A walk, a bus ride, and the downtown pressed in, a brick-red husk of a city past, its windows like vacant eyes. A kind of energy thrummed there, a pulse. But it was a heartbeat quickly swallowed by the quiet hum of the suburbs. The library stood as a boundary, a line drawn in the sand. A dichotomy. City and quiet. \n\nMemories clung to this place. The rusted swings in the park, companions after sleepless nights. The downtown crush, a blur of faces, a mad dash to the movie house. But the memories weren't all bright. The ponds, still and dark, held their own sorrows. Tears shed in the stillness, a reflection of a soul adrift. I watched the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each with their purpose. A stark contrast to the questions that churned within.\n\nI walked. Past the pond, past the houses, past the park, until the street stretched before me. The sun, a blaze of gold and fire, poured over the palm trees. Northward. Always north. The mountains, a jagged line against the sky, an unspoken promise. A reminder. To keep going.",
            "If you find yourself headed to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't be lost. The iron horse runs through it, a familiar beast in this concrete jungle.  This ain't no rural backwater. It's New York, through and through. But there's a different kind of life here.  A tide of Asian faces, new and old, has washed over these streets.  Every block, it seems, holds a store bearing the mark of their commerce - supermarkets piled high with unfamiliar goods, laundromats humming with the constant spin of endless clothes. The locals swear by them, say the food's good, the prices right, and the convenience can't be beat. I myself could walk two minutes in any direction and find myself before four of these places.  It's a grocery shopper's paradise.\n\nBut don't think Bensonhurst is a monolith. It's a quilt, stitched together with threads of every color. Immigrants and their children, born here or brought here, walk these streets.  The big businesses, though, they often bear the same mark as the shops. \n\nThere's a park nearby, newly refurbished, with courts for basketball and hand ball, a field for kicking a ball around, swings for the young'uns, and a fountain that spits water like a dragon. It's a microcosm of the city itself, a tapestry of faces under a single sky. \n\nNo towering office blocks here, not like the steel skeletons downtown.  Most are modest brick row houses, two families under one roof.  The people, they're a mix. Kind enough, but loud.  The rumble of cars, the boom of their radios, it's a constant soundtrack to the day.  You'll wake up to the roar of engines, the smell of exhaust in the air.  As night falls, though, you gotta keep your eyes open.  It's a safe place, mostly, but there's darkness in everyone.  The occasional bully, the desperate hand reaching for what isn't theirs. I've seen it myself, felt it.  A shove, a threat, a reminder that the city never sleeps, and neither do its shadows.\n\nAnd the dogs. Don't get me started on the dogs. The city's got rules about leashes, about cleaning up after them, but here, those rules are whispers in the wind.  Every morning, it's a minefield of dog shit on the sidewalk.  Watch your step, or you'll be stepping in it.",
            "The streets here run downhill, all of them. My house sits atop the steepest rise, the one the runners call their workout.  No sidewalks grace these parts, so the road is the path.  Pocked and uneven, it's a hazard for wheels.  The wires strung above, telephone and power, hang tattered and patched.  The rain falls hard here, the wind a constant companion. Branches snap, lines go down, and they mend them in a kind of ragged patchwork.  \n\nEvergreens crowd the landscape, a dark army, but the people here hate them. They want the view, the ocean, and cut the trees down with a blind, desperate fervor.  Houses rise up then, glass boxes clawing at the sky, each one hungry for the glimpse of water.  Sunsets, when they come, are a blaze of orange, the water lit from below. But the clouds are thick, a shroud more often than not, the sun a ghost behind the haze.  Damp is the air, the constant companion of the moss that crawls on everything.  Roofs, cars, even railings, all succumb to its green embrace. I left my car in the drive once, a month gone by, and when I came back it was a forest of green, furry and thick. Took three hours to scrape it all away.\n\nChildren are scarce, though the school stands nearby, a lonely sentinel.  Older folk mostly, retired, their lives a slow tide ebbing towards something unseen.  Dogs are their children, they run loose, their barks echoing in the streets.  Leave a window open, and you might find one curled up in your living room, a furry ghost in the empty spaces. \n\nRabbits scatter, fat and bold, a plague to the gardeners who curse their digging ways.  My cats, they see them as prey, and the neighborhood has grown quiet of the twitching noses and white tails.  Birds flit about, sparrows, hummingbirds, now and then a hawk or an eagle, a fleeting shadow against the clouds, until the crows, their harsh cries a warning, drive it away.\n\nNo shops here, only the restaurants by the water, their windows filled with glistening fish.  The beach is a sliver of sand, the rocks at the edge more appealing, good for throwing into the depths. The bay itself is narrow, the opposite shore a clear line even through the mist.",
            "The house squats at the corner, a sentinel on the edge of the woods. Two state highways bleed into this street, a ribbon of asphalt cutting through the quiet. Cars pass, a constant murmur on the wind. Folks here keep to themselves, tending their yards, their lives a tapestry of small routines. Winter brings a flurry of activity, children shrieking as they slide down the hill, their laughter echoing off the clapboard houses. We see them all, these faces, these fleeting glimpses into lives lived just beyond our own. A stranger's car, a new face at the mailbox - these are the things that mark the passing of time.\n\nThere are four of us here. Wife, daughters, and me.  The younger one, eleven. The older, fourteen. We work from home, these days. A blur of mornings, afternoons, evenings spent within these walls. But we carve out time for the outside.  \n\nWe play in the rain, sometimes. The smell of barbecue smoke hangs heavy in the summer air, a reminder that life, even in this quiet place, is a slow, steady burn. The lawnmowers begin their mournful song come March, and echo through the long, hot days until the grass finally yields to the coming cold.  Trees, sentinels themselves, stand guard over this place, their leaves a carpet of gold and red in the fall. They burn with a sweet, acrid smell that signals the end of summer's reign.\n\nThese days, winter seems a whisper, a distant memory. Just a long, lingering fall. We seldom use the front door, the garage at the back of the house our haven. When the doors are open, I feel a kinship with the street, the rhythm of the neighborhood pulsing through me. Holidays bring a brief flurry of activity, cars spilling onto the street like spilled ink.  Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas - fleeting moments of connection in a sea of quiet.  \n\nIt's a good place to live. If only the traffic would ease.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust. Dust everywhere. A bleached bone stretched flat beneath a sun that never relents. You don't know brown till you've seen it this way. A patch of green? That's a man's fortune laid bare in water and chemicals. Back in the 90s, houses were strung out like lonely tumbleweeds. Now, they crowd closer, new ones pushing up like weeds. The city's creeping in, swallowing the bones of the land. It's the way of things these days.  Most folks are decent enough. A scattering of kindness in this harsh landscape. But like cities, there's a darkness too.  Old folks here, mostly. A quiet kind of folks. Maybe that's why it feels less like a city, more like a slow breath held.\n\nThe stores are the same chains, the same faces. Food for Less, Smart & Final. For real food, you gotta drive. Whole Foods? Never seen one.\n\nConstruction's the lifeblood here, or at least it feels that way. The land's still raw, waiting to be carved up. It scares me, that spreading. They keep building, swallowing up the spaces that are left. I came here to escape the city, and I don't want to go back.\n\nI work with my hands, drywall and T-bars. It's honest work.\n\nThere's a kind of beauty here, a starkness that can take your breath away. The creatures that live here, the lizards skittering in the dust, the bugs that burrow in the sand. My kids, they love them. I see them out there now, chasing shadows in the heat, nets in hand.\n\nPeople come for the desert. They come for the quiet. The wide open spaces. We have our fairs, our museums, our little pieces of history. You can find a slice of something different here. But if you come, remember the desert's a living thing. Treat it with respect.",
            "The question asks for a neighborhood. Mine ain't like the others. No picket fences or yardsawdust. Mine's the campus, a stone's throw from the dorms. The buildings, they're the houses, these boxy monoliths holding onto the dreams of a hundred souls. Apartments, some stacked two stories high, hold maybe twenty souls each. Four to a room, maybe less. Then there are the houses, the few scattered about, rented out to the ghosts of alumni, the ones who still linger. And the dorms, those sprawling hives of young blood, a hundred students sharing thin walls and thinner dreams. \n\nThe people, they're a tapestry woven from every thread of the world. Old and young, black and white, the shades in between. The staff, they stay in the houses, keepers of the secrets whispered in the halls. The students, they roam the dorms, their voices a cacophony of ambition and fear. \n\nThe stores, they line the paths, offering sustenance and trinkets. Food, books, clothes, all the necessities for a life lived in the shadow of academia. And the park, a small patch of green, a haven amidst the concrete. The wind whispers through the trees, a constant reminder of the world beyond these walls.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  A decade spent under this sky, learning the lay of the land. I came here from Riverdale, a place of memory and loss.  Tears fell then, for what was left behind, for the ghosts of laughter in empty rooms.  They said it was for the best, my folks. Stockbridge. A better life. Shiny new schools, houses with lawns that didn't whisper of neglect. A clean slate. It took time, though, to make this place feel less like a stranger's doorstep and more like home.  Friends were made, some forged in fire, some fleeting as smoke. Neighbors, mostly faces in passing, shadows on the porch steps. Except for Mr. Glen and his kin. They had a way of pulling you in, a warmth that felt like family.  Remember his wedding? A second chance, a second bloom.  We danced,  the music a heartbeat in the night. I caught a stray ribbon, Ms. Veda's,  a white sliver of silk against the darkness.  Couldn't catch the flowers, though.  There's a girl, Marsharii, one of their daughters.  We talked, laughed, under the porch lights. I haven't seen her since.  Hope she's found her own way.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a labyrinth, a web of streets twisting and turning. I used to get lost, but now I have a guide, a metal box that speaks.  I still haven't seen it all, haven't explored every corner.  Kason and Curtis, they know these streets like the back of their hands. We used to play,  games with pixels and controllers, living vicariously through the heroes on the screen.  Sometimes, I'd steal away to the park.  The trees, the rustle of leaves, the silence that speaks volumes. It stills the mind, calms the restless soul.  I'd bring sticks, practice balance, wield a wooden sword.  A samurai without a war, but a warrior nonetheless.  There's a basketball court, a tennis court.  My father, he taught me tennis, with Mr. Graves.  We bled sweat and laughter under the summer sun.  They pushed us,  made us stronger. \n\nThere's a hundred stories in this place, a thousand whispers in the wind.  But these are the ones that echo in my heart.  These are the threads that weave the tapestry of my time here.  And I know, with a certainty that settles deep in my bones, that the best story is yet to be written.",
            "The college squats a stone's throw from where I make my meager bed. A neighborhood of brick and mortar, mostly apartments, with a few greasy spoons and dive bars clinging to the edges. One of the bars, rechristened just last fall, bleeds greenbacks now. The drinks are the same rotgut, the service as slow, though.  Folks around here, mostly young and restless, or worn down by the grind. The apartments, they're cheap enough for them, and there's a schoolhouse nearby, a gaggle of small children spilling out each day. I don't know my neighbors, and truth be told, I don't much care to. The smell of something sickly sweet hangs heavy in the air, a chemical balm masking the haze rising from their doorways. They smoke, you see, a lot of it. The building's management, they've tried to fight it, with an air freshener unit like a pathetic monument to futility. \n\nThe buildings themselves, they're old, bones showing through the paint. Some have been patched up inside, but the spirit of decay lingers. Down the road a ways, new blood money has risen, glassy towers built too tall, too fast. Cheap labor, cheap materials, and a price tag to match. They bleed the students dry, these new places.  There's a diner a few blocks over, serving slop on paper plates, warmed in the belly of a microwave. Across the street, a gas station, where the air smells of fuel and despair. The street's been paved over, a city project, trees trimmed back to expose the ugliness beneath. But my street, it's shrouded in shadow. A line of trees mark the edge of the city, a wall of green against the concrete. Behind my building, another set of apartments, the kind where trouble sleeps on the porch. Forty-second Street, they call it. Forty-third Street, just behind, is where the shadows deepen. The sidewalks crumble, the buildings sag, hiding their secrets behind a curtain of leaves.  \n\nCrime, it's a whispered word, a ghost that haunts these streets. One building, more than others, bears the scars. But the rot, it spreads. Apartments across the street, they too hold their share of darkness. Yet, here I stay, for the rent is low and the college is a walk away. Two bus stops, they offer a lifeline to the outside world. I make do, I survive. It's not much, but it's home.",
            "The houses squat on this cul-de-sac, duplexes paired off like lonely twins.  Spaced so as to mimic individuality, each one a pale yellow sun against the green of the roofs and white bones of their porches. Most of them know each other, these folks, though some stand aloof, their windows shut tight against the world.  Evenings find us gathered at the edge of driveways, words spilling out like water over parched ground while the young ones chase after their toys, their laughter echoing in the stillness. A slowness here, a respite from the machine hum that deafens the rest of the world.  A breath held for a moment in time. The fields stretch out, a green sea dotted with trees, the sky a canvas of blue stretched taut above. But the sky can turn quick. This season, the warnings have come more often, the sirens a low growl in the distance. Last night, the growl became a scream. We took cover. Me, the little dog nestled against my side, my purse clutched tight beside a few pillows. The big one, he didn't trust the darkness, paced the living room, a low whine rumbling in his chest. The hail fell, a thousand tiny hammers against the roof, the air thick and cold. The road, it steamed after the storm, the temperature shifting like a ghost. The sun peeked out, a sliver of gold behind the clouds, and the rain began to fall, a curtain of silver, then two arcs of fire painted across the sky. A double rainbow. I snatched my camera, a frantic heartbeat against my ribs, and captured the moment,  a fleeting beauty to share with those beyond this place.  The quiet lingered for a time, then the familiar sounds returned - the rumble of a truck, the laughter of children, the quiet murmur of conversation. Life resumed, a slow, steady pulse. I'm a stranger here, just a girl from up north, drawn to the slow drawl of their voices, the kindness in their eyes. Two rooms, two baths, that's what they all have. But inside, the stories unfold, whispered secrets in the shadows. I walk the fields behind these houses, the air thick with the scent of earth and dew. A pond lies still, its surface a mirror to the sky. Deer move silently through the tall grass, and the bullfrog sings his mournful song each morning. Forty minutes from the city, a world away. Roosters crow, a chorus of welcome each day. A small village, hidden in the heart of the fields, where the donkey brays its evening song.  A lucky find, this place.",
            "The dust settled on the street the same day I walked into eighth grade. Hard to make kin in this place at first, but I found solace in the company of two boys. One lived two houses down, the other just up the street. Both gone now, but the ghosts of their laughter still linger in the air. Some of the faces haven't changed, though. The same houses stand, two stories high, windows like vacant eyes staring down the quiet avenues. \n\nWeekends bleed into each other, sun-drenched afternoons filled with the shrieks of children chasing shadows. The air is thick with the scent of cut grass and something else, something unspoken, something that settles in your bones. It's a quiet place, this neighborhood. You're left to your own devices, but if you need help, a hand will reach out. Packages delivered safe and sound, no pilfered trinkets from porches. Trust, it's a fragile thing, and here, it seems to hold.\n\nThe park, it's a heartbeat away, a patch of green where memories bloom and fade. I ran with those boys there, basketballs bouncing, pigskin flying.  A football slammed against my nose, a jarring symphony of pain, but the echoes of laughter drown out the hurt. Now, it's the laughter of younger cousins, their small hands gripping swings, their eyes bright with the joy of a world unburdened by years.\n\nA kaleidoscope of sounds and smells, this neighborhood. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - a tapestry woven from the threads of a thousand stories. Food, it's a language spoken here, a language of comfort and belonging. But even the finest cuisine can't compete with a craving for the familiar. The greasy scent of fast food, it's a siren song, a promise of convenience. Pizza, a universal language, its warmth spreading through the belly like a comforting embrace.\n\nWalgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco - the familiar names stand sentinel, offering a promise of everything you might need. Dry cleaners hum with the quiet industry of mending and mending. An Indian store, a beacon of spices and stories, a reminder that the world is vast and wondrous.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's a haven, a refuge from the storm. I read the stories, hear the whispers of despair, and count my blessings.",
            "The town. Small. Tucked away. South Carolina dust.  Peach Capital. A sign proclaims it so, though the peaches themselves ain't much to brag about. Fields stretch out, endless rows of trees heavy with fruit or cows fattening in the sun. Houses scattered, two stories mostly, metal roofs glinting like scars in the heat.  Far back from the road, set in the fields.  One stoplight in the center, a solitary sentinel. There, the stores huddle.  Hong Kong, a family's haven of chow mein and wonton soup. Fiesta, where the burritos are the size of your head. Gary's. Burgers. Used to be a pizza place, but that went belly up a while back. \n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, a little box with a window that smells of cherry cola. That's what they're known for, that sweet, bottled memory.  IGA.  Small.  Expensive. Folks go to Batesburg-Leesville for their groceries, a pilgrimage to the big box stores.  Dollar General. That's where the real lifeblood goes. Everything you need, all under one roof. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More.  A woman runs it, kind eyes and a tired smile. She remembers folks, knows their stories.  Attached, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Dogs barking, the scent of shampoo and fear. The doctor, the vet, out on the edge of town. Small practices, but they do what they can.\n\nJohnston Elementary.  Fifth grade, and then it's time to leave. \n\nNo parks. Not really.  But they're building something. A patch of green, a place for kids to run. \n\nNot much else.  No movies, no bowling, no places to linger. Just the quiet hum of life.  A town you might miss, if you blink too fast.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place, it was on some podcast about vanishings. Folk disappearing into thin air. Strange, considering the rents. A thousand a month easy, every damned shack. Never heard a whisper of it, neither had my kin. Maybe that's the struggle. I know a few who weep themselves to sleep at night. Things tight, they are. But we've learned to live cheap. Dusty smell of flea market toys, moth-eaten clothes. That's the scent of survival. You smell less, as a man. You might take up smoke, or maybe you just grow used to the stink. But the flea market lingers. Adulthood smells like dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It gets in the leather and ain't washed out easy. Three thrift stores within walking distance, here. Start on the far side, you can hit two charity joints, a library, a book shop, and a curio shop. Downtown's a boilin' pot, cars and people squarin' off in the streets every mornin', but inside the stores, silence.  Doesn't matter how many souls or engines rumble past, the stores hold their breath. A good place to lose an afternoon, that's for sure. And every year, more and more of them come. Cars and people, floodin' in. A growin' city, they say. Headquartered for one of them online empires, e-commerce and deliveries, still got its growing pains. Reminds me of New York, in a way. Everyone's got their own compass, pointin' to their own damn goal. Ain't much anyone asks of you. You can be alone, quiet, your own man, and they'll leave you be. Not like back South, where a little concern means you give a damn.  Ain't nobody pryin' into your life here. Keep your shell on, as long as you please, and the city'll crash and roll back like waves on the shore. A lively place, it is.  Between the pianist next door and them two amateur singers upstairs, there's always somethin' goin' on. We ain't so much strangers in an apartment building, more like a community of friends. Come together for need, for birthdays, for funerals, for helpin' each other out when we can. Lucky to be here, I reckon. Like most of my neighbors, and they treat me right. I try to keep my space clean, leave them food now and then, and they do the same. Bring their mail in, they bring mine. Good to see their faces, and I believe they like my company, just as much as I theirs. Live in this big, cold, unforgiving sprawl, but it's folks like my neighbors that make me feel like maybe I didn't screw my life up too bad.",
            "The place I call home. A suburb of a kind. These cookie-cutter houses all parade in a line, each one a testament to the iron fist of the homeowner's association.  Every yard a sterile tableau: a patch of green, a scattering of stones, driveways short and clipped. Trees, if you're lucky, stand sentinel in the corners. Two car garages, each a metal maw swallowing the metal beasts within. The streets, newly poured and gleaming, snake through the sameness, a testament to the collective will of the residents. No potholes mar the surface, no wounds in the asphalt skin. Mostly single stories these houses are, though a few dare to reach for the sky, two stories high. No quaint mailboxes stand before each door. Instead, a communal cluster awaits at the street's end, a row of metal cages each holding a promise of letters and bills.  Larger lockers stand guard for packages, reminders of the world beyond this ordered realm.\n\nOut here, on the edge of the city, the suburb bleeds into the fields, a ribbon of pavement weaving through scrub and grass. More land, more space, a concession to the sprawling nature of this place. Pools shimmer in the heat, guarded gates promising a watery escape. Walking trails wind through the green, paths for those who seek solace in the rustle of leaves and the chirp of crickets. No need for parks here, the neighborhood itself is a sprawling green lung. \n\nMostly, retired folks fill these houses, faces etched with the lines of time and experience. A sense of watchful peace hangs in the air, a unspoken agreement to keep each other safe. But young blood lingers too, a few families with children, a sprinkling of professionals, their footsteps echoing the city's distant hum. \n\nThe city itself is a beast, large and teeming, yet somehow holding onto a quaintness that defies its size. A single mall, not a behemoth, but enough to satisfy the cravings of the masses. Fifteen minutes on the road and the world opens up, a buffet of stores offering everything from organic kale to bargain-basement socks.",
            "The town sits low in the valley, a breath beyond the edge of the city's sprawl. My part, east side, runs ragged. Houses lean, paint peeled like sunburnt skin. Renters mostly, or folks scraping by. But there's a kind of quiet dignity here. Neighbors wave, porch light smiles on a dusk walk.  Not a bad place, not for the want of trying. Papers say the crime's a shade higher, but that's a whisper compared to the dark hum of the city. Still, a shot rings out every now and then, a ghost in the stillness. A boy, a neighbor's boy, gone last year, outside a bar on the edge of town. Found in the street, light flickering out. We've been lucky, spared the worst. A busted window here, a package gone there, a reminder that the world bleeds in even the quietest corners.\n\nThe opioid wind whips through these parts, a sickness that took root deep. Fentanyl, they call it. The reaper in a pill bottle. Faces you see in the grocery line, hollowed out, lost. But there are lights in the darkness, too. A center here, a hand reaching out. Narcan, they say, a chance to hold on. \n\nThe school, though, that's a haven. My son, he's blessed, a different kind of broken but they treat him like gold. The teachers, their hearts are big as the sky. They know every child's name, every ache. Even the poorest kid at school gets a full belly, a hot plate in their hands. No shame, no judgment. Just kindness. The town's face is a patchwork, the center bright and shiny, new shops and paved streets. But out here, on the edge, the paint peels, the cracks widen. Still, we're home. Sixteen years, and I can't imagine leaving.  There's a hard beauty in the dust, a quiet strength in the bones of this place.",
            "The Hill held the bones of a history not so sweet.  Seven stories high, my building stood across from the old theater, a hulking presence against the dusk. A block down, the arcade bar pulsed with a dim light, drawing in a motley crew on summer nights. Lines snaked out the door, a testament to the fleeting joy it offered. Just up the incline, the city park sprawled, a patch of green swallowed by concrete. Steps, tall and unforgiving, were poured into the wall, leading nowhere. In the winter's grip, the homeless made their shelter there, a row of tents huddled against the cold. Rain was their constant companion, lashing down in sheets, making warmth a luxury. Better to be close, they figured, within reach of the family center, their refuge from the elements.\n\nBut the Hill wasn't about the buildings, not really. It was about the people.  They carried the echoes of a past steeped in violence, a time when the Feds came sweeping in, a mechanized tide against the tide of gangs. Stories lingered like dust motes, whispered from generation to generation, a reminder of a darkness that never truly fades. They worked hard, these people, to keep the Hill clean, to hold onto some semblance of order. They warned you, the white folks, not to walk these streets after dark. An old fear, a ghost story. Maybe I walked with a darkness in my own skin, or maybe they saw a flicker of their own resilience in me.\n\nBut the Hilltop was a crucible. It burned away the easy assumptions, the comfortable lies. It showed you the ugly truth of racism, of fear twisting itself into prejudice. It was a melting pot, sure, but the heat was fierce, and the edges were sharp.  \n\nNo matter where I went, I knew I'd always carry the Hilltop with me. The streets pulsed with a life that sang in your bones.  A kindness that bloomed in the most unexpected places, a jacket offered, a phone charged, a hand reaching out with a five dollar bill and a whispered affirmation. It was a place where you were seen, not just tolerated. It was home.",
            "The land here stretches out flat, a canvas of corn and sky.  The towns are small, strung along the edges like beads on a fading string.  No city's steel and glass, no monoliths of commerce. No chain ghosts of Applebee's or Wal-Mart. Everything's a drive. Still, the water holds the world in its embrace. Lake Michigan, vast and brooding, to the west. Lake Charlevoix, smaller but no less fierce, to the east. The shore is always near, a line of sand where you can brush the cold fingers of the lake.\n\nThe houses here are like old bones, weathered and worn. Some patched and painted, some left to the elements. Basements, deep and dark, yawn open beneath them. Aluminum siding, the color of a faded sunset, clings to many.  A patchwork quilt of hues, the houses stand in their yards, each a testament to lives lived, children raised. Trampolines, swings, the rusted ghosts of playsets. Gardens bursting with life, fences holding back the wandering creatures.\n\nHard work etched in every line, every calloused hand. Families, roots dug deep. Children run barefoot on the cracked asphalt, laughter echoing in the stillness. Dogs bark greetings, their tails wagging promises. Neighbors wave, a silent acknowledgment of shared space.  The lawns are neat, trimmed and cared for. No piles of fallen leaves, no untamed wilderness. Here, order reigns. \n\nIt's not a place of ostentatious beauty, but a quiet kind of peace. A place where you can learn the names of your neighbors, where trust is thicker than the summer air. The sheriff's station sits like a sentinel at the edge of town, the jail its shadow. The health department, a beacon of hope. The recycling center hums with the quiet industry of renewal. A symphony of shouts and cheers rises from the baseball field, the drone of small planes a constant reminder of the world beyond.\n\nThe air is sweet with the scent of freshly cut grass and the promise of a summer storm. The ice cream shop calls with its siren song of sweetness.  A walk to the park, a shortcut through the trees. This is not just a place to live, it's a place to belong."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem?

            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "The city sprawled. No rhythm to it. Houses and shops and offices huddled together, then scattered again. Some places you could find a meal, some a trinket. Big names and small shops, all vying for space. Malls choked with them, lining streets that were supposed to be quiet, if not for the constant hum of traffic. Parks, yes, those were there too, filled with children and their parents, a fleeting glimpse of innocence in the concrete heart.\n\nPeople. There were people everywhere. A tangle of tongues and customs. This corner, a pocket of rainbow flags and prayer shawls. A little further, the ghosts of a cold war still lingered, pale faces from a land lost. And then, scattered like forgotten prayers, Chinatown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, each a whisper of a homeland. But even a few miles could feel like a journey across an empty plain, trapped in the steel veins of traffic. Ten miles an hour, maybe two. Cars, a sea of them, a living thing that choked the breath from the city.\n\nThey built more and more, though. Towers scraping the sky, swallowing the light. More people, more cars. A hunger for space, a fear of emptiness. Houses too, some small, some grand, some crammed together like refugees. Duplexes, single-family homes, a tapestry of lives woven together. Faces I knew, faces I didn't. A childhood memory, playing with the next-door boy, a ghost of a simpler time. Now, strangers in the shadows of our own making.",
            "The houses stood in rows, mostly single-family, though some had been split in two, still joined at the hip like conjoined twins. Mine had a yard, a patch of dirt and weeds, and a drive that angled off to the left. It was a relic, a monument to a time when the suburbs were the promised land. A dream that once held them all, but now seemed to be drifting away. Still, the houses stood, a silent testament to a fading hope. \n\nThe people there weren't the same. The lawns were choked with weeds, the dreams dulled. The cars were still there, but fewer, and the kids played in the streets, oblivious to the world beyond. The schoolhouse, a brick behemoth, had stood for almost ninety years, a sentinel against time. It still cast its shadow on the young, a promise of something more, a whisper of what might be. The churches stood empty, their windows vacant eyes. But the basketball courts, they were always full, the echoes of the ball bouncing a rhythm against the silence.\n\nThe supermarket, \"Super A,\" was owned by a family from a far-off place, Yemen they called it. The only ones there not born of the land. Most were black, their faces etched with the story of a long and weary journey. The streets were wide, meant for cars, but the kids played their games, their laughter a defiant counterpoint to the rumble of engines.\n\nGenerations lived and died there. The old ones spoke of a time when everyone knew everyone else. A karate school had come and gone, a casualty of Hollywood's fickle whims. Now it was a pharmacy, dispensing pills for a world that had grown too weary. The movie theater, a relic of a bygone era, showed old films, a refuge for the elderly, their minds adrift in memories. The younger ones, they had no need for such things, their eyes fixed on the screens that flickered with the promises of a future they could never grasp.\n\nAn expressway cut through the town next door, a scar on the landscape, a reminder of the world that pushed its way in. They had tried to get an exit, a gateway to the outside, but the old ones, they had spoken against it, claiming it would ruin the town. The city council had listened, and the request was denied. Now they were building a new high school, a monument to the future, and the town was trying to choose a mascot, a symbol to represent them. A cyborg, a strange hybrid, with a country accent and a log cabin - a fitting symbol for a place caught between yesterday and tomorrow.",
            "You might miss it, passing by. Just another stretch of asphalt behind tired strip malls, a place where the sun bleeds out on cracked pavement and expectation fades. Not a place for dreaming, not for the kind of living folks whisper about. But past the rusted hulk of that old Whole Foods, behind the motels that only stir to life for a few weeks each year, families gathering like crows by a carcass, there’s another world. A string of apartment blocks huddled together, like matchsticks laid out by a child, each one a story waiting to be told. Some of them, the ones closest to the street, wear their history on their peeling paint and broken windows. News-talk whispers of trouble in those halls, things best left undisturbed. But past those shadows, past the vacant stares of the windows, are others. Places where light still finds its way in, where lives unfold beneath the thin veil of anonymity.\n\nAcross the road, the community college stands sentinel, a quiet grey thing against the endless blue. Students shuffle in, pale and bleary-eyed, clutching coffee like a lifeline against the morning. The iron gates groan open, admitting them one by one, their slow procession a thorn in the side of the impatient commuters.\n\nThe road forks, leading to a scene more familiar. A park, its grass a palette of sickly green, where children spin and leap, their laughter a sharp counterpoint to the low hum of the rehab center across the street. The air hangs heavy with the scent of chlorine and the promise of healing. On the porch, wicker chairs sit empty, swaying gently in the breeze, a promise of shade and quiet. \n\nA strip mall sprawls beside the park, a testament to the mundane rituals of survival. A sushi place, its neon sign flickering, promises cheap eats and greasy satisfaction. Next door, a swimming supply store, its shelves stocked with dreams of clear blue water. And between them, a nail salon, where chipped paint is reborn and stories are whispered between manicures. A frozen yogurt place, a beacon of sugar and artificial flavor, lures the teenagers from the park, their laughter echoing through the air as they chase the fleeting sweetness of youth.\n\nThis is America, a patchwork quilt of contradictions, where hope and despair coexist in a fragile balance. Time moves slowly here, measured by the heat of the sun and the slow crawl of cicadas.",
            "The road chewed on through the corn. Fields endless as the sky. \"Where's everything?\" she asked, the words thin in the air. I knew. Knew the shock would come, the city girl swallowed by the vastness. 5 minutes to the market, she said. Never seen this much empty. Told her about Ohio, about growing up where the air held the scent of dust and diesel.  A flicker in her eyes, a glimpse of understanding. \n\nDown a ribbon of blacktop, past a quarry filled with water like a black eye. There, nestled in the hills, the houses. Brick and stucco, each one a yard wide. Land, they call it. They take pride in it, in the neat rows of flowers that bloom in the spring, the trees that bleed color with the seasons. Driveways slick with Mercedes. Sun glistens off chrome, a mirror to the gold in the sky.\n\nMy house, grey stucco, sits at the end. Korean neighbor, always out there.  Mower hums, a song in the air. Old man, his face a map of years.  Lost some of his fire, but his eyes stay bright. Doctor once, he said. Now he blends with the grass, a green blur against the John Deere.\n\nGeese honking in the yard, our terrier barking at their shadows. Back, a creek whispers through the trees. Bullfrogs croak, and sometimes, a cow moos in the distance. A bridge, hand-hewn wood, leads to an island of green. Wildflowers, herbs, trees reaching for the sky. There, I built my world. Forts in the branches, hunted imaginary beasts. Seasons bled into each other, days long, filled with laughter and the smell of dust.\n\nWinter comes, a hard fist against the land. Green turns to grey. Trees stand stark, skeletons against the sky. Snow falls, a white shroud. My sister, snow angels and snowmen. We fought, built ice forts, hurled snowballs like shrapnel. In that white silence, we were kings, our own world hidden beneath the ice.",
            "The city of Portland. Call it what you will. Weird. They say so themselves, scrawled on some weathered brick beneath a neon sign that flickers over a place that serves pizzas by day, whiskey by night. Music spills out, a murmur of bass and drums, and the stories whispered in the shadows speak of a wilder time, a time before the gold rush came and the Californians spilled in, seeking some elusive piece of the strange.  \n\nThey call it \"Keep Portland Weird,\" a mantra etched in graffiti on alley walls, a prayer on the lips of those who fear the encroaching tide of normalcy.  But what's weird? Is it the man who sells you hand-painted shoes on a street corner? Or the woman who practices yoga with goats on a patch of grass?  Maybe it's the cardboard boxes stacked like offerings on the sidewalk, filled with cast-off dreams and forgotten treasures.\n\nPortland is a place where contradictions live side by side. It's a city of hipsters and businessmen, of rain-soaked streets and blooming gardens. It's a city where you can buy a yoga mat and a heroin needle on the same block. It's a city where the air is thick with the scent of rain and regret, but also with the faint, sweet smell of hope.\n\nThey say Portland has a problem. They say it's a city of addicts and the downtrodden, a city where shadows lengthen and darkness lingers. And maybe that's true. But in its darkness, there's a kind of beauty, a melancholic poetry that speaks to the soul.\n\nPortland is a city that doesn't apologize for being different. It's a city that embraces its flaws and celebrates its oddities. And in that, perhaps, lies its true weirdness.",
            "The mountains. They were there. Always. Northward, stoic sentinels to the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawn. Dusk. It mattered little. Even lost in the churn of work, the city's clamor, they stood, unyielding. A presence. A weight. When the mind frayed, when the soul wound tight, they called.  Turned toward them, the knot eased. A lending of strength, a breath.  \n\nIt was here, at the foot of those mountains, that I first stood. Undergrad years. The university, its brick and leaf and pond, held a certain charm. But it was the mountains that claimed the throne. The north. \n\nThe town, it had its own kind of beauty. Cafés, dark and smelling of burnt coffee, where nights bled into days. A walk, a bus ride, and the downtown pressed in, a brick-red husk of a city past, its windows like vacant eyes. A kind of energy thrummed there, a pulse. But it was a heartbeat quickly swallowed by the quiet hum of the suburbs. The library stood as a boundary, a line drawn in the sand. A dichotomy. City and quiet. \n\nMemories clung to this place. The rusted swings in the park, companions after sleepless nights. The downtown crush, a blur of faces, a mad dash to the movie house. But the memories weren't all bright. The ponds, still and dark, held their own sorrows. Tears shed in the stillness, a reflection of a soul adrift. I watched the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each with their purpose. A stark contrast to the questions that churned within.\n\nI walked. Past the pond, past the houses, past the park, until the street stretched before me. The sun, a blaze of gold and fire, poured over the palm trees. Northward. Always north. The mountains, a jagged line against the sky, an unspoken promise. A reminder. To keep going.",
            "If you find yourself headed to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't be lost. The iron horse runs through it, a familiar beast in this concrete jungle.  This ain't no rural backwater. It's New York, through and through. But there's a different kind of life here.  A tide of Asian faces, new and old, has washed over these streets.  Every block, it seems, holds a store bearing the mark of their commerce - supermarkets piled high with unfamiliar goods, laundromats humming with the constant spin of endless clothes. The locals swear by them, say the food's good, the prices right, and the convenience can't be beat. I myself could walk two minutes in any direction and find myself before four of these places.  It's a grocery shopper's paradise.\n\nBut don't think Bensonhurst is a monolith. It's a quilt, stitched together with threads of every color. Immigrants and their children, born here or brought here, walk these streets.  The big businesses, though, they often bear the same mark as the shops. \n\nThere's a park nearby, newly refurbished, with courts for basketball and hand ball, a field for kicking a ball around, swings for the young'uns, and a fountain that spits water like a dragon. It's a microcosm of the city itself, a tapestry of faces under a single sky. \n\nNo towering office blocks here, not like the steel skeletons downtown.  Most are modest brick row houses, two families under one roof.  The people, they're a mix. Kind enough, but loud.  The rumble of cars, the boom of their radios, it's a constant soundtrack to the day.  You'll wake up to the roar of engines, the smell of exhaust in the air.  As night falls, though, you gotta keep your eyes open.  It's a safe place, mostly, but there's darkness in everyone.  The occasional bully, the desperate hand reaching for what isn't theirs. I've seen it myself, felt it.  A shove, a threat, a reminder that the city never sleeps, and neither do its shadows.\n\nAnd the dogs. Don't get me started on the dogs. The city's got rules about leashes, about cleaning up after them, but here, those rules are whispers in the wind.  Every morning, it's a minefield of dog shit on the sidewalk.  Watch your step, or you'll be stepping in it.",
            "The streets here run downhill, all of them. My house sits atop the steepest rise, the one the runners call their workout.  No sidewalks grace these parts, so the road is the path.  Pocked and uneven, it's a hazard for wheels.  The wires strung above, telephone and power, hang tattered and patched.  The rain falls hard here, the wind a constant companion. Branches snap, lines go down, and they mend them in a kind of ragged patchwork.  \n\nEvergreens crowd the landscape, a dark army, but the people here hate them. They want the view, the ocean, and cut the trees down with a blind, desperate fervor.  Houses rise up then, glass boxes clawing at the sky, each one hungry for the glimpse of water.  Sunsets, when they come, are a blaze of orange, the water lit from below. But the clouds are thick, a shroud more often than not, the sun a ghost behind the haze.  Damp is the air, the constant companion of the moss that crawls on everything.  Roofs, cars, even railings, all succumb to its green embrace. I left my car in the drive once, a month gone by, and when I came back it was a forest of green, furry and thick. Took three hours to scrape it all away.\n\nChildren are scarce, though the school stands nearby, a lonely sentinel.  Older folk mostly, retired, their lives a slow tide ebbing towards something unseen.  Dogs are their children, they run loose, their barks echoing in the streets.  Leave a window open, and you might find one curled up in your living room, a furry ghost in the empty spaces. \n\nRabbits scatter, fat and bold, a plague to the gardeners who curse their digging ways.  My cats, they see them as prey, and the neighborhood has grown quiet of the twitching noses and white tails.  Birds flit about, sparrows, hummingbirds, now and then a hawk or an eagle, a fleeting shadow against the clouds, until the crows, their harsh cries a warning, drive it away.\n\nNo shops here, only the restaurants by the water, their windows filled with glistening fish.  The beach is a sliver of sand, the rocks at the edge more appealing, good for throwing into the depths. The bay itself is narrow, the opposite shore a clear line even through the mist.",
            "The house squats at the corner, a sentinel on the edge of the woods. Two state highways bleed into this street, a ribbon of asphalt cutting through the quiet. Cars pass, a constant murmur on the wind. Folks here keep to themselves, tending their yards, their lives a tapestry of small routines. Winter brings a flurry of activity, children shrieking as they slide down the hill, their laughter echoing off the clapboard houses. We see them all, these faces, these fleeting glimpses into lives lived just beyond our own. A stranger's car, a new face at the mailbox - these are the things that mark the passing of time.\n\nThere are four of us here. Wife, daughters, and me.  The younger one, eleven. The older, fourteen. We work from home, these days. A blur of mornings, afternoons, evenings spent within these walls. But we carve out time for the outside.  \n\nWe play in the rain, sometimes. The smell of barbecue smoke hangs heavy in the summer air, a reminder that life, even in this quiet place, is a slow, steady burn. The lawnmowers begin their mournful song come March, and echo through the long, hot days until the grass finally yields to the coming cold.  Trees, sentinels themselves, stand guard over this place, their leaves a carpet of gold and red in the fall. They burn with a sweet, acrid smell that signals the end of summer's reign.\n\nThese days, winter seems a whisper, a distant memory. Just a long, lingering fall. We seldom use the front door, the garage at the back of the house our haven. When the doors are open, I feel a kinship with the street, the rhythm of the neighborhood pulsing through me. Holidays bring a brief flurry of activity, cars spilling onto the street like spilled ink.  Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas - fleeting moments of connection in a sea of quiet.  \n\nIt's a good place to live. If only the traffic would ease.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust. Dust everywhere. A bleached bone stretched flat beneath a sun that never relents. You don't know brown till you've seen it this way. A patch of green? That's a man's fortune laid bare in water and chemicals. Back in the 90s, houses were strung out like lonely tumbleweeds. Now, they crowd closer, new ones pushing up like weeds. The city's creeping in, swallowing the bones of the land. It's the way of things these days.  Most folks are decent enough. A scattering of kindness in this harsh landscape. But like cities, there's a darkness too.  Old folks here, mostly. A quiet kind of folks. Maybe that's why it feels less like a city, more like a slow breath held.\n\nThe stores are the same chains, the same faces. Food for Less, Smart & Final. For real food, you gotta drive. Whole Foods? Never seen one.\n\nConstruction's the lifeblood here, or at least it feels that way. The land's still raw, waiting to be carved up. It scares me, that spreading. They keep building, swallowing up the spaces that are left. I came here to escape the city, and I don't want to go back.\n\nI work with my hands, drywall and T-bars. It's honest work.\n\nThere's a kind of beauty here, a starkness that can take your breath away. The creatures that live here, the lizards skittering in the dust, the bugs that burrow in the sand. My kids, they love them. I see them out there now, chasing shadows in the heat, nets in hand.\n\nPeople come for the desert. They come for the quiet. The wide open spaces. We have our fairs, our museums, our little pieces of history. You can find a slice of something different here. But if you come, remember the desert's a living thing. Treat it with respect.",
            "The question asks for a neighborhood. Mine ain't like the others. No picket fences or yardsawdust. Mine's the campus, a stone's throw from the dorms. The buildings, they're the houses, these boxy monoliths holding onto the dreams of a hundred souls. Apartments, some stacked two stories high, hold maybe twenty souls each. Four to a room, maybe less. Then there are the houses, the few scattered about, rented out to the ghosts of alumni, the ones who still linger. And the dorms, those sprawling hives of young blood, a hundred students sharing thin walls and thinner dreams. \n\nThe people, they're a tapestry woven from every thread of the world. Old and young, black and white, the shades in between. The staff, they stay in the houses, keepers of the secrets whispered in the halls. The students, they roam the dorms, their voices a cacophony of ambition and fear. \n\nThe stores, they line the paths, offering sustenance and trinkets. Food, books, clothes, all the necessities for a life lived in the shadow of academia. And the park, a small patch of green, a haven amidst the concrete. The wind whispers through the trees, a constant reminder of the world beyond these walls.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  A decade spent under this sky, learning the lay of the land. I came here from Riverdale, a place of memory and loss.  Tears fell then, for what was left behind, for the ghosts of laughter in empty rooms.  They said it was for the best, my folks. Stockbridge. A better life. Shiny new schools, houses with lawns that didn't whisper of neglect. A clean slate. It took time, though, to make this place feel less like a stranger's doorstep and more like home.  Friends were made, some forged in fire, some fleeting as smoke. Neighbors, mostly faces in passing, shadows on the porch steps. Except for Mr. Glen and his kin. They had a way of pulling you in, a warmth that felt like family.  Remember his wedding? A second chance, a second bloom.  We danced,  the music a heartbeat in the night. I caught a stray ribbon, Ms. Veda's,  a white sliver of silk against the darkness.  Couldn't catch the flowers, though.  There's a girl, Marsharii, one of their daughters.  We talked, laughed, under the porch lights. I haven't seen her since.  Hope she's found her own way.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a labyrinth, a web of streets twisting and turning. I used to get lost, but now I have a guide, a metal box that speaks.  I still haven't seen it all, haven't explored every corner.  Kason and Curtis, they know these streets like the back of their hands. We used to play,  games with pixels and controllers, living vicariously through the heroes on the screen.  Sometimes, I'd steal away to the park.  The trees, the rustle of leaves, the silence that speaks volumes. It stills the mind, calms the restless soul.  I'd bring sticks, practice balance, wield a wooden sword.  A samurai without a war, but a warrior nonetheless.  There's a basketball court, a tennis court.  My father, he taught me tennis, with Mr. Graves.  We bled sweat and laughter under the summer sun.  They pushed us,  made us stronger. \n\nThere's a hundred stories in this place, a thousand whispers in the wind.  But these are the ones that echo in my heart.  These are the threads that weave the tapestry of my time here.  And I know, with a certainty that settles deep in my bones, that the best story is yet to be written.",
            "The college squats a stone's throw from where I make my meager bed. A neighborhood of brick and mortar, mostly apartments, with a few greasy spoons and dive bars clinging to the edges. One of the bars, rechristened just last fall, bleeds greenbacks now. The drinks are the same rotgut, the service as slow, though.  Folks around here, mostly young and restless, or worn down by the grind. The apartments, they're cheap enough for them, and there's a schoolhouse nearby, a gaggle of small children spilling out each day. I don't know my neighbors, and truth be told, I don't much care to. The smell of something sickly sweet hangs heavy in the air, a chemical balm masking the haze rising from their doorways. They smoke, you see, a lot of it. The building's management, they've tried to fight it, with an air freshener unit like a pathetic monument to futility. \n\nThe buildings themselves, they're old, bones showing through the paint. Some have been patched up inside, but the spirit of decay lingers. Down the road a ways, new blood money has risen, glassy towers built too tall, too fast. Cheap labor, cheap materials, and a price tag to match. They bleed the students dry, these new places.  There's a diner a few blocks over, serving slop on paper plates, warmed in the belly of a microwave. Across the street, a gas station, where the air smells of fuel and despair. The street's been paved over, a city project, trees trimmed back to expose the ugliness beneath. But my street, it's shrouded in shadow. A line of trees mark the edge of the city, a wall of green against the concrete. Behind my building, another set of apartments, the kind where trouble sleeps on the porch. Forty-second Street, they call it. Forty-third Street, just behind, is where the shadows deepen. The sidewalks crumble, the buildings sag, hiding their secrets behind a curtain of leaves.  \n\nCrime, it's a whispered word, a ghost that haunts these streets. One building, more than others, bears the scars. But the rot, it spreads. Apartments across the street, they too hold their share of darkness. Yet, here I stay, for the rent is low and the college is a walk away. Two bus stops, they offer a lifeline to the outside world. I make do, I survive. It's not much, but it's home.",
            "The houses squat on this cul-de-sac, duplexes paired off like lonely twins.  Spaced so as to mimic individuality, each one a pale yellow sun against the green of the roofs and white bones of their porches. Most of them know each other, these folks, though some stand aloof, their windows shut tight against the world.  Evenings find us gathered at the edge of driveways, words spilling out like water over parched ground while the young ones chase after their toys, their laughter echoing in the stillness. A slowness here, a respite from the machine hum that deafens the rest of the world.  A breath held for a moment in time. The fields stretch out, a green sea dotted with trees, the sky a canvas of blue stretched taut above. But the sky can turn quick. This season, the warnings have come more often, the sirens a low growl in the distance. Last night, the growl became a scream. We took cover. Me, the little dog nestled against my side, my purse clutched tight beside a few pillows. The big one, he didn't trust the darkness, paced the living room, a low whine rumbling in his chest. The hail fell, a thousand tiny hammers against the roof, the air thick and cold. The road, it steamed after the storm, the temperature shifting like a ghost. The sun peeked out, a sliver of gold behind the clouds, and the rain began to fall, a curtain of silver, then two arcs of fire painted across the sky. A double rainbow. I snatched my camera, a frantic heartbeat against my ribs, and captured the moment,  a fleeting beauty to share with those beyond this place.  The quiet lingered for a time, then the familiar sounds returned - the rumble of a truck, the laughter of children, the quiet murmur of conversation. Life resumed, a slow, steady pulse. I'm a stranger here, just a girl from up north, drawn to the slow drawl of their voices, the kindness in their eyes. Two rooms, two baths, that's what they all have. But inside, the stories unfold, whispered secrets in the shadows. I walk the fields behind these houses, the air thick with the scent of earth and dew. A pond lies still, its surface a mirror to the sky. Deer move silently through the tall grass, and the bullfrog sings his mournful song each morning. Forty minutes from the city, a world away. Roosters crow, a chorus of welcome each day. A small village, hidden in the heart of the fields, where the donkey brays its evening song.  A lucky find, this place.",
            "The dust settled on the street the same day I walked into eighth grade. Hard to make kin in this place at first, but I found solace in the company of two boys. One lived two houses down, the other just up the street. Both gone now, but the ghosts of their laughter still linger in the air. Some of the faces haven't changed, though. The same houses stand, two stories high, windows like vacant eyes staring down the quiet avenues. \n\nWeekends bleed into each other, sun-drenched afternoons filled with the shrieks of children chasing shadows. The air is thick with the scent of cut grass and something else, something unspoken, something that settles in your bones. It's a quiet place, this neighborhood. You're left to your own devices, but if you need help, a hand will reach out. Packages delivered safe and sound, no pilfered trinkets from porches. Trust, it's a fragile thing, and here, it seems to hold.\n\nThe park, it's a heartbeat away, a patch of green where memories bloom and fade. I ran with those boys there, basketballs bouncing, pigskin flying.  A football slammed against my nose, a jarring symphony of pain, but the echoes of laughter drown out the hurt. Now, it's the laughter of younger cousins, their small hands gripping swings, their eyes bright with the joy of a world unburdened by years.\n\nA kaleidoscope of sounds and smells, this neighborhood. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - a tapestry woven from the threads of a thousand stories. Food, it's a language spoken here, a language of comfort and belonging. But even the finest cuisine can't compete with a craving for the familiar. The greasy scent of fast food, it's a siren song, a promise of convenience. Pizza, a universal language, its warmth spreading through the belly like a comforting embrace.\n\nWalgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco - the familiar names stand sentinel, offering a promise of everything you might need. Dry cleaners hum with the quiet industry of mending and mending. An Indian store, a beacon of spices and stories, a reminder that the world is vast and wondrous.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's a haven, a refuge from the storm. I read the stories, hear the whispers of despair, and count my blessings.",
            "The town. Small. Tucked away. South Carolina dust.  Peach Capital. A sign proclaims it so, though the peaches themselves ain't much to brag about. Fields stretch out, endless rows of trees heavy with fruit or cows fattening in the sun. Houses scattered, two stories mostly, metal roofs glinting like scars in the heat.  Far back from the road, set in the fields.  One stoplight in the center, a solitary sentinel. There, the stores huddle.  Hong Kong, a family's haven of chow mein and wonton soup. Fiesta, where the burritos are the size of your head. Gary's. Burgers. Used to be a pizza place, but that went belly up a while back. \n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, a little box with a window that smells of cherry cola. That's what they're known for, that sweet, bottled memory.  IGA.  Small.  Expensive. Folks go to Batesburg-Leesville for their groceries, a pilgrimage to the big box stores.  Dollar General. That's where the real lifeblood goes. Everything you need, all under one roof. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More.  A woman runs it, kind eyes and a tired smile. She remembers folks, knows their stories.  Attached, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Dogs barking, the scent of shampoo and fear. The doctor, the vet, out on the edge of town. Small practices, but they do what they can.\n\nJohnston Elementary.  Fifth grade, and then it's time to leave. \n\nNo parks. Not really.  But they're building something. A patch of green, a place for kids to run. \n\nNot much else.  No movies, no bowling, no places to linger. Just the quiet hum of life.  A town you might miss, if you blink too fast.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place, it was on some podcast about vanishings. Folk disappearing into thin air. Strange, considering the rents. A thousand a month easy, every damned shack. Never heard a whisper of it, neither had my kin. Maybe that's the struggle. I know a few who weep themselves to sleep at night. Things tight, they are. But we've learned to live cheap. Dusty smell of flea market toys, moth-eaten clothes. That's the scent of survival. You smell less, as a man. You might take up smoke, or maybe you just grow used to the stink. But the flea market lingers. Adulthood smells like dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It gets in the leather and ain't washed out easy. Three thrift stores within walking distance, here. Start on the far side, you can hit two charity joints, a library, a book shop, and a curio shop. Downtown's a boilin' pot, cars and people squarin' off in the streets every mornin', but inside the stores, silence.  Doesn't matter how many souls or engines rumble past, the stores hold their breath. A good place to lose an afternoon, that's for sure. And every year, more and more of them come. Cars and people, floodin' in. A growin' city, they say. Headquartered for one of them online empires, e-commerce and deliveries, still got its growing pains. Reminds me of New York, in a way. Everyone's got their own compass, pointin' to their own damn goal. Ain't much anyone asks of you. You can be alone, quiet, your own man, and they'll leave you be. Not like back South, where a little concern means you give a damn.  Ain't nobody pryin' into your life here. Keep your shell on, as long as you please, and the city'll crash and roll back like waves on the shore. A lively place, it is.  Between the pianist next door and them two amateur singers upstairs, there's always somethin' goin' on. We ain't so much strangers in an apartment building, more like a community of friends. Come together for need, for birthdays, for funerals, for helpin' each other out when we can. Lucky to be here, I reckon. Like most of my neighbors, and they treat me right. I try to keep my space clean, leave them food now and then, and they do the same. Bring their mail in, they bring mine. Good to see their faces, and I believe they like my company, just as much as I theirs. Live in this big, cold, unforgiving sprawl, but it's folks like my neighbors that make me feel like maybe I didn't screw my life up too bad.",
            "The place I call home. A suburb of a kind. These cookie-cutter houses all parade in a line, each one a testament to the iron fist of the homeowner's association.  Every yard a sterile tableau: a patch of green, a scattering of stones, driveways short and clipped. Trees, if you're lucky, stand sentinel in the corners. Two car garages, each a metal maw swallowing the metal beasts within. The streets, newly poured and gleaming, snake through the sameness, a testament to the collective will of the residents. No potholes mar the surface, no wounds in the asphalt skin. Mostly single stories these houses are, though a few dare to reach for the sky, two stories high. No quaint mailboxes stand before each door. Instead, a communal cluster awaits at the street's end, a row of metal cages each holding a promise of letters and bills.  Larger lockers stand guard for packages, reminders of the world beyond this ordered realm.\n\nOut here, on the edge of the city, the suburb bleeds into the fields, a ribbon of pavement weaving through scrub and grass. More land, more space, a concession to the sprawling nature of this place. Pools shimmer in the heat, guarded gates promising a watery escape. Walking trails wind through the green, paths for those who seek solace in the rustle of leaves and the chirp of crickets. No need for parks here, the neighborhood itself is a sprawling green lung. \n\nMostly, retired folks fill these houses, faces etched with the lines of time and experience. A sense of watchful peace hangs in the air, a unspoken agreement to keep each other safe. But young blood lingers too, a few families with children, a sprinkling of professionals, their footsteps echoing the city's distant hum. \n\nThe city itself is a beast, large and teeming, yet somehow holding onto a quaintness that defies its size. A single mall, not a behemoth, but enough to satisfy the cravings of the masses. Fifteen minutes on the road and the world opens up, a buffet of stores offering everything from organic kale to bargain-basement socks.",
            "The town sits low in the valley, a breath beyond the edge of the city's sprawl. My part, east side, runs ragged. Houses lean, paint peeled like sunburnt skin. Renters mostly, or folks scraping by. But there's a kind of quiet dignity here. Neighbors wave, porch light smiles on a dusk walk.  Not a bad place, not for the want of trying. Papers say the crime's a shade higher, but that's a whisper compared to the dark hum of the city. Still, a shot rings out every now and then, a ghost in the stillness. A boy, a neighbor's boy, gone last year, outside a bar on the edge of town. Found in the street, light flickering out. We've been lucky, spared the worst. A busted window here, a package gone there, a reminder that the world bleeds in even the quietest corners.\n\nThe opioid wind whips through these parts, a sickness that took root deep. Fentanyl, they call it. The reaper in a pill bottle. Faces you see in the grocery line, hollowed out, lost. But there are lights in the darkness, too. A center here, a hand reaching out. Narcan, they say, a chance to hold on. \n\nThe school, though, that's a haven. My son, he's blessed, a different kind of broken but they treat him like gold. The teachers, their hearts are big as the sky. They know every child's name, every ache. Even the poorest kid at school gets a full belly, a hot plate in their hands. No shame, no judgment. Just kindness. The town's face is a patchwork, the center bright and shiny, new shops and paved streets. But out here, on the edge, the paint peels, the cracks widen. Still, we're home. Sixteen years, and I can't imagine leaving.  There's a hard beauty in the dust, a quiet strength in the bones of this place.",
            "The Hill held the bones of a history not so sweet.  Seven stories high, my building stood across from the old theater, a hulking presence against the dusk. A block down, the arcade bar pulsed with a dim light, drawing in a motley crew on summer nights. Lines snaked out the door, a testament to the fleeting joy it offered. Just up the incline, the city park sprawled, a patch of green swallowed by concrete. Steps, tall and unforgiving, were poured into the wall, leading nowhere. In the winter's grip, the homeless made their shelter there, a row of tents huddled against the cold. Rain was their constant companion, lashing down in sheets, making warmth a luxury. Better to be close, they figured, within reach of the family center, their refuge from the elements.\n\nBut the Hill wasn't about the buildings, not really. It was about the people.  They carried the echoes of a past steeped in violence, a time when the Feds came sweeping in, a mechanized tide against the tide of gangs. Stories lingered like dust motes, whispered from generation to generation, a reminder of a darkness that never truly fades. They worked hard, these people, to keep the Hill clean, to hold onto some semblance of order. They warned you, the white folks, not to walk these streets after dark. An old fear, a ghost story. Maybe I walked with a darkness in my own skin, or maybe they saw a flicker of their own resilience in me.\n\nBut the Hilltop was a crucible. It burned away the easy assumptions, the comfortable lies. It showed you the ugly truth of racism, of fear twisting itself into prejudice. It was a melting pot, sure, but the heat was fierce, and the edges were sharp.  \n\nNo matter where I went, I knew I'd always carry the Hilltop with me. The streets pulsed with a life that sang in your bones.  A kindness that bloomed in the most unexpected places, a jacket offered, a phone charged, a hand reaching out with a five dollar bill and a whispered affirmation. It was a place where you were seen, not just tolerated. It was home.",
            "The land here stretches out flat, a canvas of corn and sky.  The towns are small, strung along the edges like beads on a fading string.  No city's steel and glass, no monoliths of commerce. No chain ghosts of Applebee's or Wal-Mart. Everything's a drive. Still, the water holds the world in its embrace. Lake Michigan, vast and brooding, to the west. Lake Charlevoix, smaller but no less fierce, to the east. The shore is always near, a line of sand where you can brush the cold fingers of the lake.\n\nThe houses here are like old bones, weathered and worn. Some patched and painted, some left to the elements. Basements, deep and dark, yawn open beneath them. Aluminum siding, the color of a faded sunset, clings to many.  A patchwork quilt of hues, the houses stand in their yards, each a testament to lives lived, children raised. Trampolines, swings, the rusted ghosts of playsets. Gardens bursting with life, fences holding back the wandering creatures.\n\nHard work etched in every line, every calloused hand. Families, roots dug deep. Children run barefoot on the cracked asphalt, laughter echoing in the stillness. Dogs bark greetings, their tails wagging promises. Neighbors wave, a silent acknowledgment of shared space.  The lawns are neat, trimmed and cared for. No piles of fallen leaves, no untamed wilderness. Here, order reigns. \n\nIt's not a place of ostentatious beauty, but a quiet kind of peace. A place where you can learn the names of your neighbors, where trust is thicker than the summer air. The sheriff's station sits like a sentinel at the edge of town, the jail its shadow. The health department, a beacon of hope. The recycling center hums with the quiet industry of renewal. A symphony of shouts and cheers rises from the baseball field, the drone of small planes a constant reminder of the world beyond.\n\nThe air is sweet with the scent of freshly cut grass and the promise of a summer storm. The ice cream shop calls with its siren song of sweetness.  A walk to the park, a shortcut through the trees. This is not just a place to live, it's a place to belong."
