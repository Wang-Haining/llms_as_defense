            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city sprawls, a concrete and steel expanse where the line between living and commerce blurs. Brick and glass buildings rise like sentinels, their shadows stretching long and thin across streets choked with metal beasts. Here, in the belly of this beast, a million different lives play out, a symphony of honking horns and sirens, of laughter and despair. \n\nThere are pockets of green, patches of grass struggling to survive amidst the asphalt, where mothers push strollers and children chase pigeons. But the concrete holds fast.  \n\nThe faces I see are a tapestry woven from different threads – a man in a kippah, a woman with a rainbow flag pinned to her jacket, a young girl with eyes as dark as the night sky, her tongue lost in the melodies of a language I don't know. They come and go, these souls, each with their stories, their sorrows, their dreams. \n\nWe live in a city of fragments, places carved out for different tribes – Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia – each a world unto itself.  Ten miles, they say, can be a journey of hours, a slow crawl through a river of steel. \n\nThe air hangs thick with exhaust, the sky a bruised gray canvas. Buildings rise, ever higher, monuments to progress, to ambition. More people, they say, more dreams. But what happens to the dreams when they're all crammed into a space too small to hold them? \n\nInside my own small world, there are echoes of a different time, a time when children played without fear, when neighbors knew each other's names. Now, the houses stand silent, their windows like vacant eyes staring out at the city's relentless pulse.",
            "The houses here are mostly single, each a kind of box with a porch, though a few have been split in two, joined at the hip but separate souls. My own sits with a small patch of grass in front, a cracked concrete path leading to the door. It's the kind of place that whispers of a time not so far gone when the suburbs were the promise. That promise, it felt like it could hold the whole country, but now it's pulling back, like water receding from the shore. Still, these houses stand, these yards hold on, a testament to a dream still waiting to be realized. \n\nThe faces here, they don't wear the same hopeful masks they used to. The lawns are patchy, the paint peels. But the driveways hold cars, and the kids, they run free, oblivious to the world beyond the crack in the sidewalk. The school, old as sin, still stands, a beacon for the young, a ghost for the old. Churches are scattered like forgotten prayers, mostly empty. But the blacktop courts, they're alive. Basketball echoes in the twilight.\n\nThey all look different, these houses, but they feel the same. A supermarket, Super \"A,\" owned by a family from a faraway land, Yemen maybe. The only ones like them in this sea of brown faces. Streets stretch wide, empty save for children kicking a ball, pausing only for the rumble of a car passing through. Most folks here, they've been rooted in this soil for generations, their stories etched in the lines on their faces. They remember when everyone knew each other's name, when the karate school on the corner was packed, before Hollywood decided those stories weren't worth telling anymore. Now it's a pharmacy, dispensing pills like promises. \n\nThere's a small movie theater, showing flicks from another time, a refuge for the old, ignored by the young. An expressway cuts through the town next door, a scar on the landscape. We wanted a ramp, a connection to the world, but the elders said no. Too much change, they whispered. Now they're building a new school, and we're arguing about a mascot. A cyborg with a country drawl, a log cabin on its back. Maybe that's what we are, a contradiction held together by the rust of time.",
            "The place might pass you by. A quiet stretch behind a strip of fading storefronts. Not the sort of place folks think to look for a life, or the kind most would want. But past the husk of the old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty save for the ghosts of summer families, lies a world unseen. \n\nBack there, nestled tight as dolls in a box, are a line of apartments. Each one a piece of a story no one tells.  The first ones, those you see on the news, with their whispers of ill deeds, best left undisturbed. But the ones beside them, the ones hidden in the shadows, hold a truth unknown.\n\nAcross the road, a college campus waits, its buildings quiet and watchful. Students drift in, coffee cups in hand, eyes heavy against the dawn. The iron gates creak, admitting them one by one, while cars fume and impatient fists shake from the windows.\n\nThe road forks, leading to another street, a park on one side, a rehab center on the other.  The center boasts a porch swing and a fan that stirs the thick, humid air.  Children run through the grass, their laughter a thin echo in the heat. Old folks walk their dogs, their eyes fixed on the ground, scowling at the teenagers carving their stories on skateboards. \n\nA strip mall stands sentinel, a sushi place tucked next to a swimming supply store, a nail salon nestled in between.  Frozen yogurt, bright and cold, spills from cups clutched by teens, their faces flushed with the heat and the sting of cheap rebellion.\n\nThis place, this slice of the South, it holds fast to a time that slips away elsewhere. A history written in chipped paint and worn sidewalks, a story whispered in the rustle of leaves and the hum of cicadas.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked, the words thin as the sky above the endless corn. We rolled past fields stretching to the horizon, a sea of green under the sun's relentless gaze. \"This is it,\" I said, knowing the sight would steal her breath. \n\nShe came from a town where the world was crowded, where the grocery store was a heartbeat away. Open space like this was a language she didn't know. The cornfields pressed in on her, an alien landscape. I told her of growing up in the heart of Ohio, of the dirt under my fingernails and the sky so wide it felt like it could swallow you whole. In those words, she saw me, finally, the boy I'd always been.\n\nDown the two-lane blacktop, past a quarry choked with water, lay the development. Brick and stucco houses, each one a stone island in a sea of green. Half an acre of land, at least, to each one, and they guarded it fiercely. Spring brought a riot of color, flowers spilling across the lawns like spilled paint. The trees, they lived and died with the seasons, shedding their leaves like tired bones. In the driveways, gleaming in the midday heat, sat the silver beasts: Mercedes, gleaming like sins. \n\nAs we neared my own house, a grey stucco box, our neighbor emerged. Korean, with a face creased by time and a smile that never faded. He spent his days wrestling the lawn, his mower a humming beast, his voice rising above it in a song I couldn't understand.  They laughed at him, but he was a good man, a doctor once, lost in the green wilderness of his yard. He moved slow now, his wit dulled, his eyes lost in the horizon.\n\nMy house. A thin stream ran behind it, feeding into the quarry. Bullfrogs croaked in the twilight, a lonely cow moaned in the distance. A handmade wooden bridge crossed the stream, leading to a haven untouched by man. Trees, herbs, wildflowers, a secret world where I'd spent my childhood. Forts built of branches, games of chase played in the fading light. Friendships forged in the dust and the heat, memories etched in the bark of the trees.\n\nWinter came like a fist, brutal and unforgiving. The world turned white, the grass died, the trees stood bare. Snow angels in the yard, snowmen with coal eyes, and my sister, my constant companion, my rival. Snowballs flew, forts were built, battles waged in the white silence. We were kings and queens of our own winter kingdom, young and fearless, nothing but the cold and the snow between us and forever.",
            "The truth is, Portland ain't for the faint of heart. You gotta understand what \"weird\" means here. It ain't some quaint notion, some tourist trap. It's etched on the back of a greasy spoon, a place where the aroma of pizza mingles with the stench of cheap beer and the muffled music of some forgotten band. On that same sign, they say \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some folks, they see it as a relic, a memory of a time when this town was hidden, cheap, a haven for the offbeat. Others, they see it as a promise, an invitation to come be different, to find your tribe in the shadows.  \n\nEven now, with Californians pouring in like locusts, their bank accounts bloated and their eyes hungry for the next avocado toast, Portland still breathes a certain kind of strangeness. It ain't a blind acceptance, no. We got our share of fights, our petty squabbles, our wars fought over parking spaces and the price of coffee. We buy our things from the same factories as everyone else, churn out the same anxieties and dreams. But there's a difference. We wear it different.\n\nOut here, in these streets, you see old houses painted in colors that would make a church deacon faint. Gardens bloom with flowers and herbs, vegetables spilling over the fences like a curse. And then there are the boxes. These cardboard monoliths, filled with someone else's castoffs, left on the curb like offerings to the gods of chance. Clothes, books, broken toys, you never know what you'll find. Sometimes it's a faded photograph, a glimpse into someone else's life. Sometimes it's a book that speaks to your soul. It's a reminder that even in the midst of this concrete jungle, there's still a touch of magic.\n\nAnd that's Portland to me. A place where the ordinary is imbued with a strange, unsettling beauty. A place where you can be yourself, whatever that means, without judgment.\n\nBut don't mistake it for a utopia. We got our problems. Drugs gnaw at the edges, a slow, insidious rot. People sleep on the streets, ghosts in a city that's too busy to see them. \n\nWe're not so different from the rest of the world, after all.",
            "The mountains. They are always there. In the north. Bearing witness. To the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawn. Dusk. It matters not how far the mind wanders, how lost in the work and the worry, they stand. Unbowed. Undeterred. \n\nThey demand to be seen on the days when the soul is frayed. When the mind is a knotted rope. And in their stark presence, a kind of peace. A strength to see the next hour through.\n\nCame here first for the books, the learning. But it was the mountains, north of the campus, that drew the eye. The university, with its brick and mortar, its ponds and courtyards, it holds a place. But the mountains, they are the king.\n\nThe town itself, it has a quiet grace. Cafés that hum with the drone of thought, fueled by bitter coffee. A downtown, a heartbeat closer. Faded brick, the ghosts of merchants past. A city's spirit, but compressed, contained. Then, a turn, a breath, and the quiet returns. The library, a line drawn in the sand, separating the two.\n\nA town living in the shadow of a city. Contradictions held close.\n\nMemories bloom here. Swings creaking in the park, the laughter of friends, the sting of a late-night realization. The rush of the downtown, the glow of the theater, a ticket bought with stolen time.\n\nBut there are sorrows too. The ponds, still and reflective, a place for tears in the dead of night. An existential ache, a question mark etched on the soul. Watching the turtles move, the ducks preen, the insects scrabble, a question arises: what is my place in this?\n\nSteps taken, past the pond, past the houses, small and neat, whispers of suburbia. Then, a main street. The sun, a blaze of gold, crowns the palms. Upward, the eyes rise. North.\n\nThere they are. The mountains. Silent, enduring. A promise. They stand against the dying light, a silent language understood. Perseverance.",
            "The road to Bensonhurst ain't hard to find. The iron horse and the rumbling buses, they snake through the city like veins, carrying you to this corner of it. It ain't no wilderness, that's for sure. Brick and steel, all around, the city's breath on your neck. But there's a different scent here, a whisper of spice and incense, a tide of East come meetin' West.  \n\nEverywhere you walk, the shops bear the mark of a new world. Grocery stores stacked high with unfamiliar fruits, laundromats humming with the ghosts of a thousand stories. The locals swear by 'em, say the food's good, the prices cheap, and the convenience, well, that's a prayer answered. Four of them, just a stone's throw from where I stand.\n\nBut don't think it's all chop suey and dumplings. This place, it's a tapestry woven from threads of every hue.  Folks from every corner, first and second generation, all tryin' to make their place under the sun. \n\nThere's a park nearby, all green and fresh, with courts for ball games and a playground for the young'uns. Even a fountain to splash in when the sun beats down. And like the city itself, it's a melting pot of faces, a symphony of languages.\n\nThere ain't no towering giants here, no corporate monoliths. Mostly it's houses, two families sharing a stoop, lookin' out on the street. People are decent enough, though the noise, it never sleeps. Cars roar past, bass thumpin' like the pulse of the city itself. Wake you up in the mornin', that's for sure.\n\nNighttime's a different beast. Keep your eyes open, your wits sharper. The city's a wild thing, and there are shadows that lurk in every corner.  I've seen my share of trouble here, felt the sting of a fist, the sting of a stolen package.  \n\nAnd the dogs, Lord have mercy on the dogs.  \n\nThey leave their mark on every sidewalk, a constant reminder that even in this concrete jungle, nature finds a way.",
            "The streets here are few and far between. A slope of dust and scrub, the land falls away, and the house sits perched atop the highest rise. The locals call it the \"workout hill,\" a steady climb for the runners that come to test their legs. No sidewalk exists, the road itself a ribbon black against the green, pitted and scarred in places. The wires overhead, strung thin and brittle, hang low, a tangled web of copper and weathered wood. Rain comes often, a shroud of grey, and the wind tears loose branches and limbs. They strike the lines, weaving a patchwork of repairs across the landscape. \n\nEvergreens crowd the hillsides, thick and silent. But the people here, they hate them. They hack and slash, craving the open view of the water.  So the houses rise, gaunt and glassy, clawing at the sky, their second stories gaping like eyes. At dusk, the water bleeds color, a fiery orange beneath a bruised sky. But the light is fleeting, swallowed by the clouds that hang heavy, a perpetual dampness clinging to the air. Moss spreads like a disease, creeping over everything: roofs, rusted cars, the iron railings. Once left my truck in the drive for a month. Came back to find it draped in a green shroud, furry and thick. Took three hours to scrape it clean.\n\nChildren are scarce, a few strays glimpsed at the schoolhouse down the way. Mostly, it's the old folk, their lives spent, their days long and slow. Dogs fill the void. They roam the lawns, barking at the wind, chasing each other down the road. A loose door, a window left ajar, and they'll slip inside, their eyes bright and curious. Found one once in the living room, a rust-colored blur, had to shoo it back out into the dust.\n\nRabbits scurry, fattened on wild clover, a nuisance to the gardeners. They burrow and tear, leaving trails of destruction in their wake. But the cats, they relish the chase. The neighborhood is a hunting ground. Hawks and eagles wheel overhead, their shadows fleeting, chased away by the raucous cries of crows. \n\nNo shops or stores, just the whisper of the sea. Down by the water, a few restaurants, serving the catch of the day. The beach is but a sliver of sand, but the rocks are tempting, smooth and cold beneath the hand. They cast a long arc, a splash of white against the grey, before sinking into the depths. The bay is narrow, the other shore a hazy line on the horizon.",
            "The house sits on the corner. Two ways in and two ways out. A street that cuts through the town like a scar. You see them all come and go. Cars like metal beetles crawling along.  Folks busy with the work of it all. Lawns mown close, chores done.  Winter brings the children down the hill on their sleds,  a fleeting taste of joy in the grey light. We are home a lot. Wife, daughters, myself. Eleven and fourteen. The house breathes with us. Sometimes the rain comes down and the girls run barefoot in the puddles. Smoke from the grill hangs heavy in the air, a promise of something warm. Grass grows like a green tide, relentless.  And in the fall, the leaves fall, a brown shroud over the earth. We burn them, the smell a whisper of what is coming. The winters are fading. A long, slow burn, not a crisp bite.  The garage is at the back, a sanctuary.  Doors open and the world slips in, a symphony of car engines and lawnmowers. Holidays bring a flurry of strangers, cars crowding the street.  Then silence again. A quiet that settles deep in the bones. It's a place. A place to hold.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust, sun-bleached dust, stretches to the horizon. You wouldn't understand it unless you'd lived here, breathed it in. Seen the brown, day after day, and the rare splash of green, a lawn manicured to death, a testament to some man's obsession. Back in the 90s, the houses were scattered, a breath between them. Now, they're closer. More of them. A creeping city, though most places are the same way, swallowed whole.  Folks are mostly decent, like anywhere else, good and bad mixed in the stew. Mostly old folks around here, friendly. A decent enough place. Stores are chain places, Food 4 Less, Smart & Final. Want something fancy, you gotta drive. No Whole Foods here, not in this dustbowl. Construction's the trade that runs this town, at least as far as I can see. Still lots of open land, they're building on it fast. Scares me, I like it this way, quiet. Left the city once, not going back.  My work's in construction too. Drywall, T-bar. Hang it up, watch it grow. The desert, that's what draws folks here. The stark beauty of it, the way it bites back. The creatures, the things that crawl and fly, they need this place, need it protected. We share it, we learn to live with them. My kids, they're obsessed with lizards, bugs, chasing them through the scrub. We've adapted, alright.  There's things to do here, too. Victorville, it's a family place, different, maybe. They got a fair every year, San Bernardino County. A whole mess of fun, Victorville style. Go up to Wrightwood, see the snow on the mountains, maybe even try some winter sports. And if you want to know about the desert, the history of it, the museum. Rocks, bones, old things, they tell a story. The story of this place, of Victorville.",
            "They ask you to describe your neighborhood. A common enough question. Most would speak of lawns and picket fences, of porches and backyards. But my neighborhood… it’s different. It’s the cold brick and echoing halls of the dorm, the scattered lights in the windows like fallen stars. It’s the murmur of voices in the stairwells, the ghosts of laughter in the common rooms.  \n\nThere are houses here, yes.  But they’re not the kind you’d find in those picture books.  Apartments stacked like concrete hives, holding scores of souls in close quarters. There are houses too, older ones, two-storied and weathered, where the alumni hold court. And then there are the dorms, these sprawling, labyrinthine things, filled with the restless energy of youth. Each room a cage, each floor a world unto itself.\n\nPeople.\n\nA kaleidoscope of faces.  Young, old, from every corner of the earth.  The staff, their eyes weary but their purpose clear, live in the older houses, sentinels in the rising tide of students. The freshmen, wide-eyed and hopeful, huddle in the dorms, their lives a blur of lectures and late-night study sessions. The seniors, their faces etched with the weight of experience, seek refuge in the apartments, preparing for the world beyond these walls.\n\nThere are stores here too, feeding the hunger of this strange ecosystem.  Cafeterias that churn out endless platters of sustenance, cramped convenience stores stocked with necessities and junk food, a bookstore where dreams are bought and sold. And in the center of it all, a park. A small patch of green, a sanctuary from the concrete jungle.\n\nThis is my neighborhood. A microcosm of the world, contained within the confines of the campus. A place where lives intersect, where dreams are shaped, where futures are forged.",
            "Ten years. A decade in this place. I reckon I know a thing or two about it now. When I first came, from Riverdale to this Stockbridge place, the tears came easy. Missed them, I did. Loved them. But Mama and Papa, they were set on something better. Better houses, a better school. They called it moving up, said it was a blessing. Maybe it was. \n\nMade friends, made enemies. School does that. Never really got close to the neighbors, not much. Besides Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis for a spell. Good folks, those. Almost family, come to think of it. Remember Mr. Glen's wedding, him and Veda tying the knot again? Good time, that was. Old memories come back now, thinking about it. Me and Mama and Papa and my sister, all dancing the night away. Makes a man think about his own future, about building a life, finding a woman to share it with. A queen, maybe. I caught Veda's white strap when she tossed it, but not the flowers. Funny thing, that. \n\nThe neighborhood, it's a maze, all twists and turns. Got a GPS now, though. Helps a man navigate.  Kason and Curtis, those boys, we used to spend our time together. Video games, life in general.  \n\nSometimes I'd find myself at the park, just watching the trees sway. Makes a man feel small, in a good way. Brings a kind of peace. I practice with sticks, sometimes. Got a bokken too, a wooden sword. Keeps a man sharp. There's a court for basketball, a court for tennis. Haven't touched them in a while, but they're still there, waiting.  My old man, he used to make me and Curtis play tennis with Mr. Graves. Good times, those. He pushed us hard, but it was all in good fun. \n\nThis place, it's seen a lot.  I've seen a lot.  But the best, I reckon, is yet to come.",
            "The college sits close enough to walk, a thing I find some comfort in. The neighborhood's a patchwork of flats, a few dives and joints, none of them too hard on the purse. One bar just changed hands, prices gone up, but the whiskey's still whiskey. The people, mostly kids with books or folks scraping by, are alright. Kind enough. There's a school for young ones down the way, small fry running about. I don't know my neighbors, no need to. The smell of something green and sweet drifts from one door, choked by an air freshener that hangs like a mockery. The buildings themselves are old bones, some with new skins stretched over them. Down the road, they're building new, but slapdash. Cheap bones, high price tags. A scam, though the school draws them in like moths to a flame.\n\nThere's a greasy spoon a few minutes' walk, paper plates and microwaved meals, the kind that stick to your ribs. Across from it, a gas station, a place I hear the devil himself wouldn't work. But last summer they came through with a city grant, redid the road, put down new sidewalks, planted grass like a desperate attempt to dress up the place.\n\nMy building is choked by trees, some stumps where others fell. More woods behind, then another row of flats. 42nd Street, they call it. Behind me, 43rd, a shadow of its neighbor. Sidewalks cracked, buildings like teeth missing from a jaw. Trees there too, but maybe to hide the rot. Crime's a shadow in these parts, a whisper in the halls.  The flats across the street, they've seen their share, same as the ones down the road. \n\nBut I make do. Can afford it, close to the school. Two bus stops to the stores, the city proper. It's not much, but it's mine.",
            "The houses stood crammed together like a row of teeth, each a yellowed duplicate with white lips and tin roofs the color of spring grass.  The cul-de-sac was a dead end, a circle of quiet. Most of them knew each other, these families, their children sprawled like ants in the dust. The air hung thick with the drone of cicadas, the sun a white fist in the sky. It was a world apart from the machines and the cold lights of the city.  A world where the storms had teeth.\n\nThe sky had turned the color of bruised fruit that night, the wind a low moan in the trees.  The sirens screamed, a jagged edge against the quiet, and we all ran for cover. The bathtub, a porcelain ark, was where I waited, the small dog trembling in my arms, my purse clutched tight. The big one refused to budge, pacing the living room, a low growl rumbling in its chest.  The hail came down like a thousand icy fists, pounding the earth. The air grew thick with the smell of wet dust.\n\nThe storm passed, leaving a world washed clean. The road steamed, a ribbon of heat in the air. A rainbow, double-headed, unfurled across the sky. I ran inside, the camera clicking, capturing the impossible beauty.\n\nLater, as dusk settled, the children returned, their laughter ringing in the stillness. It was as if nothing had happened.  Life went on.\n\nThese houses, these families, they were my new world. A world of porch swings and sun-warmed faces. A world where the rooster's crow was the call to morning. A world where the donkey brayed at night, a lonely sound in the stillness. A world, for now, that felt like home.",
            "The sun bled low, staining the sky the color of old bruises.  That's when I moved in, just shy of eighth grade. The air hung heavy with the scent of cut grass and the ghosts of laughter from houses long empty. Found a couple of boys to share the dust with, two houses down and another a mile or so down the street. They're gone now, scattered like autumn leaves, but the memory of their laughter, the echo of their kicks against a rusted ball, it lingers still. \n\nMost folks who were here back then, they're still here. Same two-story houses, same sun-bleached lawns.  Weekends, when the heat presses down like a suffocating blanket, you can hear the young ones screaming, their joy a thin, sharp wire strung across the quiet streets. The houses are quiet most days, a silent tableau of lives unfolding behind closed doors. Never had a problem with a soul in this place.  You're left alone, until you need something. Then hands reach out, neighbors offering a helping hand, a shared meal.  Never had a package vanish from my porch, never had a door left ajar. Trust grows in this place, slow and sure as the creeping vines that choke the old oak by the road.\n\nThere's a park, a breath of green in the concrete sea. It's been my playground, my cathedral of memories.  Basketball, football, baseball -  the echoes of those games rise like dust devils in the summer wind.  Even the bad memories, the sting of a well-placed elbow, a nose bloodied, they fade. The good ones, the laughter, the camaraderie, those are etched in stone. Now, it's the small ones I see there, my cousin's children, their eyes wide with wonder, their laughter a bright counterpoint to the hushed whispers of the past.  They swing and slide, their joys a fragile, fleeting thing.  The park, it pulls at me, a tug of time, a reminder of innocence lost and found again.\n\nThis place, it's a tapestry woven with threads of different colors.  A hundred stories unfold in the symphony of smells that rise from the restaurants -  Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - a melting pot of flavors.  They say progress marches on, that now folks order their food through glowing rectangles, but the scent of simmering spices, the clinking of silverware, those things remain.  Fast food, it's everywhere, a greasy stain on the landscape. But there are good pizza places here, places that know the secret of dough and sauce and fire. You need something, you'll find it here.  Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store -  even an Indian shop, if you're looking for a taste of home.\n\nIt's a good place, this neighborhood. Reading about the horrors, the violence, the fear that plagues other places, it makes me appreciate the quiet, the stillness, the unspoken trust that binds us here. This is where I belong, where the roots run deep and the memories linger like the smoke from a dying fire.",
            "The town sits hunkered down in the South Carolina lowcountry, a nondescript patch of earth given over to the orchard and the range. Johnston. They call it the Peach Capital of the World, a boast scrawled across the town's welcome sign like a faded promise. Peach trees and cattle, that's what stretches to the horizon. Houses, if you can call them that, are scattered like tumbleweeds, two stories most of 'em, metal roofs gleaming under the sun or gray shingles sagging with the weight of years. Set back from the road, leaving the front fields for the livestock and crops that sustain this place.  \n\nDown in the town's belly, where the road cuts four ways, hangs a single, lonely stoplight. That's where the commerce gathers. A trio of fast food joints: Hong Kong, a family's meager operation serving up Chinese food; Fiesta, a splash of Mexican in this bland landscape; and Gary's, a chain spitting out burgers that taste like regret. A pizzeria used to be there, but it went belly up a while back. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family affair, peddling pills and cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, the only grocery in town, but folks head to Batesburg-Leesville for their real provisions. Dollar General, though, that's where the town's heartbeat resides. A plastic haven of necessities, packed from dawn till dusk. And then there's Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a woman with a kind face and a lifetime of stories, her shop attached to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where they pamper the town's furry companions. \n\nA doctor's office and a vet's, both small, both struggling to keep pace with the town's needs. Johnston Elementary, a brick box where the youngest learn their ABCs. Beyond that, the kids gotta ride the bus to the next town for middle and high school. No parks, no theaters, no bowling alleys, just the endless fields and the quiet hum of a town that's content to exist, unnoticed, on the edge of time.",
            "The name of the place first came to me on some tinny podcast, voices whispering of vanishings. It struck odd. Every box in this town held a price tag north of a thousand a month. Never heard a word of it, neither had my friends. The weight of it all, perhaps. I know a few of them, they cry themselves to sleep. The cost of living. It claws at you. But we've learned to be lean. You start savoring the dust on flea market toys, the smell of mothballed clothes. You smell less, that's for sure. You might take up a smoke, or maybe you just get used to the stink. But the flea market, it sticks with you. The scent of this life, it's dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It burrows in the leather, stays there even after you wash it clean. Here, three thrift shops you can reach on foot. Start at the far edge, and you can walk past two charity bins, a library, a place for the old and rare, and a shop full of oddities. Downtown, the streets swarm. Cars and bodies pressed together, every morning. But in the thrift shops, it's quiet. Doesn't matter how many souls pass by, the silence holds. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more and more of them come. The cars, the people, it floods in. A growing city, they say. This one of the big online empires, headquarters here, delivering things to the world. Still got its growing pains. Reminds me of New York. Everyone chasing their own ghost, no one asking much of you. You can be alone, quiet, stay in your corner, and no one bats an eye. Not like down South, where concern means you care. Here, they leave you to your own devices. You can keep your walls up as high as you want, and the city goes on, crashing and rolling like waves on the shore.  Lively place, this one. Between the pianist next door and the two amateurs upstairs belting out tunes, there's always something happening. It's more a community than a collection of strangers, some of us. We come together. Birthdays, funerals, help each other when we can. Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of the neighbors are alright. They treat me right. I keep my place tidy, leave them a plate of food now and then, and they do the same. I bring their mail, they bring mine. It's good to see them, and I think they're glad to see me too. A giant, cold, concrete beast this place is. But it's folks like my neighbors that make it feel like maybe, just maybe, I didn't screw everything up.",
            "The place I call home stretches out flat and baked beneath the sun. You might call it suburbia, but the word feels hollow, like a rusting tin can kicked down the road.  Everywhere you look, houses huddle together, each one a mirror image of the last.  Same neat lawns, same gravel dust, same two-car garages where metal beasts sleep. The air hangs thick with the smell of cut grass and a kind of sterile quiet.  They call it order, this sameness.  They call it security.  \n\nThere's a master plan here, etched in concrete and manicured hedges.  The mailboxes stand like sentinels, a metal row huddled together at the end of the road, a key the only passport to belonging.  No individual plots, no whispers of individuality.  A pool shimmers in the distance, a blue rectangle of manufactured joy.  Walking trails snake through the green carpet, a place to purge the restless energy that comes with knowing too much, knowing too little.  \n\nThe houses themselves are mostly one story, though some rise up with a second floor, a second chance at escape.  Folks here are mostly old, their bones settling into this place like stones in a dry riverbed.  A few younger faces flit in and out, chasing some phantom dream of stability.  \n\nThe city, a sprawling thing of brick and steel, lies just beyond the edge of this ordered world.  A mall, the size of a small town, stands as a monument to consumption, a place where the ghosts of choice wander amongst the aisles.  Fifteen minutes in the car, a journey through sterile landscapes and the hum of engines, and you’re there.  \n\nThis place, it's safe.  Everyone knows everyone, or at least they know the stories.  It's a place where the past whispers in the wind, a place where the future feels like a broken record. It's a place to be comfortable, a place to fade away.",
            "The town sits low, a hollowed-out place wedged between the sprawl and the city's hungry maw. East side, they call it. Where the houses huddle close, weary bones against the wind. A lot of folks here lean hard to keep their heads above water, pockets thin, lives worn. But there's a kind of grit in the air, a stubborn hope that clings to the porch swings and the faded paint.\n\nNeighbors wave, faces creased with the stories of a life lived hard. The street's a thin thread of cracked asphalt, the air thick with the smell of burning leaves and regret.  A few times, the silence has been shattered, the echo of gunfire a hollow drumbeat against the night. Lost a boy, the family next door. Gunfire in the dark, spilled blood on the pavement. They say the devil's got a hold of this town, whispers carried on the wind. Fentanyl, they call it. A slow death, a cold hand reaching in. But there are whispers of hope too. Places where folks try to claw their way back, a fighting chance against the tide.\n\nMy son, he goes to school. A haven in the dust. Good folks there, teachers with tired eyes but a fierce love for the kids. He's got needs, special needs, but they treat him like gold. The school feeds the hungry, clothes the naked, and tries to mend the broken.  The town's got its scars, its wounds. But there's a beauty in the broken places, a resilience that shines through the cracks. It's a town that stays in your bones, a place where you can't help but feel the weight of its history, the ache of its heart. This is home.",
            "The Hill holds her. Buildings claw at the sky, ghosts of a time when things were different. Seven stories high, my own wall stares out across the street at the old theater, its marquee dark and dusty. A block down, the neon glow of the arcade bar spills out onto the sidewalk, drawing a swarm of souls on the warm nights. June and July, the line snakes out the door, a promise of fleeting joy. A few paces up, the park, a concrete island in a sea of brick. Tall steps rise from the ground, a cold stone embrace in winter. Then the men come, huddled in rows, their tents a ragged tapestry against the gray. Not much snow here, but the rain, the rain comes down in torrents, a relentless curtain in the heart of winter.  Closer to the warmth, the city's heart, they make their stand. In the distance, the Family Center, a beacon of some small solace.\n\nThey don't forget, these people. The Hill, once a scar on the West Coast, a name whispered in fear. The stories linger, tales of agents and raids, a war fought in shadows. Three decades gone, but the ghosts remain. They work, these people, cleaning the streets, holding onto what little dignity they have. They say, if you're white, don't walk alone after dark. A warning, a shadow from the past. Or maybe, just maybe, they see something in me. A darkness that blurs the lines. Perhaps they recognize the ache, the constant vigilance, the reminders that plague us all. The fear, the ignorance, the weight of assumptions.\n\nHilltop, it's home. The streets hum at night, a symphony of life and struggle. They offer me warmth, kindness, a shoulder against the cold. Someone keeps a laundromat open, a flicker of light in the darkness. A stranger looks me in the eye, hands me five dollars, whispers, \"You're beautiful, you're valuable.\" And in that moment, I believe it.",
            "The country holds me here. Small town Michigan, where fields give way to towns strung like beads on a faded map. No city sprawls, no chains, no neon glow. Just the long road, the engine's hum, and the dust rising behind. But the land, it holds beauty. Water, on all sides. Lake Michigan, a cold vastness, and Charlevoix, smaller, but no less stark. Beaches everywhere, sun-bleached sand and the whisper of waves.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's the bones of a place, each house a story etched in wood and stone. Not stacked high, but spread out, breathing. Some renewed, some weathered, each with a basement, a darkness below. Aluminum siding, the color of rain, covers many. Houses of every shade, like a forgotten box of crayons, line the streets. Yards, green and unruly, with swings that creak and the ghosts of laughter. Gardens, fences, dogs barking. The scent of cut grass, of woodsmoke in the evening. Hardworking folks, raising families, the lifeblood of the place.\n\nChildren run, their laughter echoing in the quiet. Dogs chase squirrels, old men sit on porches, rocking slowly. A wave, a nod, a shared silence. The lawnmower's drone, the rumble of a passing car. It's not a place of flash or grandeur, but a place where you can feel the earth beneath your feet, where the sun sets slow and the moon rises heavy. Safe. A place to be rooted, to find solace.\n\nThe sheriff's station, a stoic stone sentinel, stands watch. The health department, a quiet presence. The recycling center, a place of quiet industry. Even the airport, a small thing, with its whispers of engines, feels like a part of the rhythm of this place. An ice cream parlor, a few blocks away, where the scent of waffle cones hangs heavy in the air. The park, eight blocks, a place for children to run free.\n\nIt's a place that whispers of belonging, of community. A place, maybe, where you can finally find your way home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city sprawls, a concrete and steel expanse where the line between living and commerce blurs. Brick and glass buildings rise like sentinels, their shadows stretching long and thin across streets choked with metal beasts. Here, in the belly of this beast, a million different lives play out, a symphony of honking horns and sirens, of laughter and despair. \n\nThere are pockets of green, patches of grass struggling to survive amidst the asphalt, where mothers push strollers and children chase pigeons. But the concrete holds fast.  \n\nThe faces I see are a tapestry woven from different threads – a man in a kippah, a woman with a rainbow flag pinned to her jacket, a young girl with eyes as dark as the night sky, her tongue lost in the melodies of a language I don't know. They come and go, these souls, each with their stories, their sorrows, their dreams. \n\nWe live in a city of fragments, places carved out for different tribes – Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia – each a world unto itself.  Ten miles, they say, can be a journey of hours, a slow crawl through a river of steel. \n\nThe air hangs thick with exhaust, the sky a bruised gray canvas. Buildings rise, ever higher, monuments to progress, to ambition. More people, they say, more dreams. But what happens to the dreams when they're all crammed into a space too small to hold them? \n\nInside my own small world, there are echoes of a different time, a time when children played without fear, when neighbors knew each other's names. Now, the houses stand silent, their windows like vacant eyes staring out at the city's relentless pulse.",
            "The houses here are mostly single, each a kind of box with a porch, though a few have been split in two, joined at the hip but separate souls. My own sits with a small patch of grass in front, a cracked concrete path leading to the door. It's the kind of place that whispers of a time not so far gone when the suburbs were the promise. That promise, it felt like it could hold the whole country, but now it's pulling back, like water receding from the shore. Still, these houses stand, these yards hold on, a testament to a dream still waiting to be realized. \n\nThe faces here, they don't wear the same hopeful masks they used to. The lawns are patchy, the paint peels. But the driveways hold cars, and the kids, they run free, oblivious to the world beyond the crack in the sidewalk. The school, old as sin, still stands, a beacon for the young, a ghost for the old. Churches are scattered like forgotten prayers, mostly empty. But the blacktop courts, they're alive. Basketball echoes in the twilight.\n\nThey all look different, these houses, but they feel the same. A supermarket, Super \"A,\" owned by a family from a faraway land, Yemen maybe. The only ones like them in this sea of brown faces. Streets stretch wide, empty save for children kicking a ball, pausing only for the rumble of a car passing through. Most folks here, they've been rooted in this soil for generations, their stories etched in the lines on their faces. They remember when everyone knew each other's name, when the karate school on the corner was packed, before Hollywood decided those stories weren't worth telling anymore. Now it's a pharmacy, dispensing pills like promises. \n\nThere's a small movie theater, showing flicks from another time, a refuge for the old, ignored by the young. An expressway cuts through the town next door, a scar on the landscape. We wanted a ramp, a connection to the world, but the elders said no. Too much change, they whispered. Now they're building a new school, and we're arguing about a mascot. A cyborg with a country drawl, a log cabin on its back. Maybe that's what we are, a contradiction held together by the rust of time.",
            "The place might pass you by. A quiet stretch behind a strip of fading storefronts. Not the sort of place folks think to look for a life, or the kind most would want. But past the husk of the old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty save for the ghosts of summer families, lies a world unseen. \n\nBack there, nestled tight as dolls in a box, are a line of apartments. Each one a piece of a story no one tells.  The first ones, those you see on the news, with their whispers of ill deeds, best left undisturbed. But the ones beside them, the ones hidden in the shadows, hold a truth unknown.\n\nAcross the road, a college campus waits, its buildings quiet and watchful. Students drift in, coffee cups in hand, eyes heavy against the dawn. The iron gates creak, admitting them one by one, while cars fume and impatient fists shake from the windows.\n\nThe road forks, leading to another street, a park on one side, a rehab center on the other.  The center boasts a porch swing and a fan that stirs the thick, humid air.  Children run through the grass, their laughter a thin echo in the heat. Old folks walk their dogs, their eyes fixed on the ground, scowling at the teenagers carving their stories on skateboards. \n\nA strip mall stands sentinel, a sushi place tucked next to a swimming supply store, a nail salon nestled in between.  Frozen yogurt, bright and cold, spills from cups clutched by teens, their faces flushed with the heat and the sting of cheap rebellion.\n\nThis place, this slice of the South, it holds fast to a time that slips away elsewhere. A history written in chipped paint and worn sidewalks, a story whispered in the rustle of leaves and the hum of cicadas.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked, the words thin as the sky above the endless corn. We rolled past fields stretching to the horizon, a sea of green under the sun's relentless gaze. \"This is it,\" I said, knowing the sight would steal her breath. \n\nShe came from a town where the world was crowded, where the grocery store was a heartbeat away. Open space like this was a language she didn't know. The cornfields pressed in on her, an alien landscape. I told her of growing up in the heart of Ohio, of the dirt under my fingernails and the sky so wide it felt like it could swallow you whole. In those words, she saw me, finally, the boy I'd always been.\n\nDown the two-lane blacktop, past a quarry choked with water, lay the development. Brick and stucco houses, each one a stone island in a sea of green. Half an acre of land, at least, to each one, and they guarded it fiercely. Spring brought a riot of color, flowers spilling across the lawns like spilled paint. The trees, they lived and died with the seasons, shedding their leaves like tired bones. In the driveways, gleaming in the midday heat, sat the silver beasts: Mercedes, gleaming like sins. \n\nAs we neared my own house, a grey stucco box, our neighbor emerged. Korean, with a face creased by time and a smile that never faded. He spent his days wrestling the lawn, his mower a humming beast, his voice rising above it in a song I couldn't understand.  They laughed at him, but he was a good man, a doctor once, lost in the green wilderness of his yard. He moved slow now, his wit dulled, his eyes lost in the horizon.\n\nMy house. A thin stream ran behind it, feeding into the quarry. Bullfrogs croaked in the twilight, a lonely cow moaned in the distance. A handmade wooden bridge crossed the stream, leading to a haven untouched by man. Trees, herbs, wildflowers, a secret world where I'd spent my childhood. Forts built of branches, games of chase played in the fading light. Friendships forged in the dust and the heat, memories etched in the bark of the trees.\n\nWinter came like a fist, brutal and unforgiving. The world turned white, the grass died, the trees stood bare. Snow angels in the yard, snowmen with coal eyes, and my sister, my constant companion, my rival. Snowballs flew, forts were built, battles waged in the white silence. We were kings and queens of our own winter kingdom, young and fearless, nothing but the cold and the snow between us and forever.",
            "The truth is, Portland ain't for the faint of heart. You gotta understand what \"weird\" means here. It ain't some quaint notion, some tourist trap. It's etched on the back of a greasy spoon, a place where the aroma of pizza mingles with the stench of cheap beer and the muffled music of some forgotten band. On that same sign, they say \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some folks, they see it as a relic, a memory of a time when this town was hidden, cheap, a haven for the offbeat. Others, they see it as a promise, an invitation to come be different, to find your tribe in the shadows.  \n\nEven now, with Californians pouring in like locusts, their bank accounts bloated and their eyes hungry for the next avocado toast, Portland still breathes a certain kind of strangeness. It ain't a blind acceptance, no. We got our share of fights, our petty squabbles, our wars fought over parking spaces and the price of coffee. We buy our things from the same factories as everyone else, churn out the same anxieties and dreams. But there's a difference. We wear it different.\n\nOut here, in these streets, you see old houses painted in colors that would make a church deacon faint. Gardens bloom with flowers and herbs, vegetables spilling over the fences like a curse. And then there are the boxes. These cardboard monoliths, filled with someone else's castoffs, left on the curb like offerings to the gods of chance. Clothes, books, broken toys, you never know what you'll find. Sometimes it's a faded photograph, a glimpse into someone else's life. Sometimes it's a book that speaks to your soul. It's a reminder that even in the midst of this concrete jungle, there's still a touch of magic.\n\nAnd that's Portland to me. A place where the ordinary is imbued with a strange, unsettling beauty. A place where you can be yourself, whatever that means, without judgment.\n\nBut don't mistake it for a utopia. We got our problems. Drugs gnaw at the edges, a slow, insidious rot. People sleep on the streets, ghosts in a city that's too busy to see them. \n\nWe're not so different from the rest of the world, after all.",
            "The mountains. They are always there. In the north. Bearing witness. To the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawn. Dusk. It matters not how far the mind wanders, how lost in the work and the worry, they stand. Unbowed. Undeterred. \n\nThey demand to be seen on the days when the soul is frayed. When the mind is a knotted rope. And in their stark presence, a kind of peace. A strength to see the next hour through.\n\nCame here first for the books, the learning. But it was the mountains, north of the campus, that drew the eye. The university, with its brick and mortar, its ponds and courtyards, it holds a place. But the mountains, they are the king.\n\nThe town itself, it has a quiet grace. Cafés that hum with the drone of thought, fueled by bitter coffee. A downtown, a heartbeat closer. Faded brick, the ghosts of merchants past. A city's spirit, but compressed, contained. Then, a turn, a breath, and the quiet returns. The library, a line drawn in the sand, separating the two.\n\nA town living in the shadow of a city. Contradictions held close.\n\nMemories bloom here. Swings creaking in the park, the laughter of friends, the sting of a late-night realization. The rush of the downtown, the glow of the theater, a ticket bought with stolen time.\n\nBut there are sorrows too. The ponds, still and reflective, a place for tears in the dead of night. An existential ache, a question mark etched on the soul. Watching the turtles move, the ducks preen, the insects scrabble, a question arises: what is my place in this?\n\nSteps taken, past the pond, past the houses, small and neat, whispers of suburbia. Then, a main street. The sun, a blaze of gold, crowns the palms. Upward, the eyes rise. North.\n\nThere they are. The mountains. Silent, enduring. A promise. They stand against the dying light, a silent language understood. Perseverance.",
            "The road to Bensonhurst ain't hard to find. The iron horse and the rumbling buses, they snake through the city like veins, carrying you to this corner of it. It ain't no wilderness, that's for sure. Brick and steel, all around, the city's breath on your neck. But there's a different scent here, a whisper of spice and incense, a tide of East come meetin' West.  \n\nEverywhere you walk, the shops bear the mark of a new world. Grocery stores stacked high with unfamiliar fruits, laundromats humming with the ghosts of a thousand stories. The locals swear by 'em, say the food's good, the prices cheap, and the convenience, well, that's a prayer answered. Four of them, just a stone's throw from where I stand.\n\nBut don't think it's all chop suey and dumplings. This place, it's a tapestry woven from threads of every hue.  Folks from every corner, first and second generation, all tryin' to make their place under the sun. \n\nThere's a park nearby, all green and fresh, with courts for ball games and a playground for the young'uns. Even a fountain to splash in when the sun beats down. And like the city itself, it's a melting pot of faces, a symphony of languages.\n\nThere ain't no towering giants here, no corporate monoliths. Mostly it's houses, two families sharing a stoop, lookin' out on the street. People are decent enough, though the noise, it never sleeps. Cars roar past, bass thumpin' like the pulse of the city itself. Wake you up in the mornin', that's for sure.\n\nNighttime's a different beast. Keep your eyes open, your wits sharper. The city's a wild thing, and there are shadows that lurk in every corner.  I've seen my share of trouble here, felt the sting of a fist, the sting of a stolen package.  \n\nAnd the dogs, Lord have mercy on the dogs.  \n\nThey leave their mark on every sidewalk, a constant reminder that even in this concrete jungle, nature finds a way.",
            "The streets here are few and far between. A slope of dust and scrub, the land falls away, and the house sits perched atop the highest rise. The locals call it the \"workout hill,\" a steady climb for the runners that come to test their legs. No sidewalk exists, the road itself a ribbon black against the green, pitted and scarred in places. The wires overhead, strung thin and brittle, hang low, a tangled web of copper and weathered wood. Rain comes often, a shroud of grey, and the wind tears loose branches and limbs. They strike the lines, weaving a patchwork of repairs across the landscape. \n\nEvergreens crowd the hillsides, thick and silent. But the people here, they hate them. They hack and slash, craving the open view of the water.  So the houses rise, gaunt and glassy, clawing at the sky, their second stories gaping like eyes. At dusk, the water bleeds color, a fiery orange beneath a bruised sky. But the light is fleeting, swallowed by the clouds that hang heavy, a perpetual dampness clinging to the air. Moss spreads like a disease, creeping over everything: roofs, rusted cars, the iron railings. Once left my truck in the drive for a month. Came back to find it draped in a green shroud, furry and thick. Took three hours to scrape it clean.\n\nChildren are scarce, a few strays glimpsed at the schoolhouse down the way. Mostly, it's the old folk, their lives spent, their days long and slow. Dogs fill the void. They roam the lawns, barking at the wind, chasing each other down the road. A loose door, a window left ajar, and they'll slip inside, their eyes bright and curious. Found one once in the living room, a rust-colored blur, had to shoo it back out into the dust.\n\nRabbits scurry, fattened on wild clover, a nuisance to the gardeners. They burrow and tear, leaving trails of destruction in their wake. But the cats, they relish the chase. The neighborhood is a hunting ground. Hawks and eagles wheel overhead, their shadows fleeting, chased away by the raucous cries of crows. \n\nNo shops or stores, just the whisper of the sea. Down by the water, a few restaurants, serving the catch of the day. The beach is but a sliver of sand, but the rocks are tempting, smooth and cold beneath the hand. They cast a long arc, a splash of white against the grey, before sinking into the depths. The bay is narrow, the other shore a hazy line on the horizon.",
            "The house sits on the corner. Two ways in and two ways out. A street that cuts through the town like a scar. You see them all come and go. Cars like metal beetles crawling along.  Folks busy with the work of it all. Lawns mown close, chores done.  Winter brings the children down the hill on their sleds,  a fleeting taste of joy in the grey light. We are home a lot. Wife, daughters, myself. Eleven and fourteen. The house breathes with us. Sometimes the rain comes down and the girls run barefoot in the puddles. Smoke from the grill hangs heavy in the air, a promise of something warm. Grass grows like a green tide, relentless.  And in the fall, the leaves fall, a brown shroud over the earth. We burn them, the smell a whisper of what is coming. The winters are fading. A long, slow burn, not a crisp bite.  The garage is at the back, a sanctuary.  Doors open and the world slips in, a symphony of car engines and lawnmowers. Holidays bring a flurry of strangers, cars crowding the street.  Then silence again. A quiet that settles deep in the bones. It's a place. A place to hold.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust, sun-bleached dust, stretches to the horizon. You wouldn't understand it unless you'd lived here, breathed it in. Seen the brown, day after day, and the rare splash of green, a lawn manicured to death, a testament to some man's obsession. Back in the 90s, the houses were scattered, a breath between them. Now, they're closer. More of them. A creeping city, though most places are the same way, swallowed whole.  Folks are mostly decent, like anywhere else, good and bad mixed in the stew. Mostly old folks around here, friendly. A decent enough place. Stores are chain places, Food 4 Less, Smart & Final. Want something fancy, you gotta drive. No Whole Foods here, not in this dustbowl. Construction's the trade that runs this town, at least as far as I can see. Still lots of open land, they're building on it fast. Scares me, I like it this way, quiet. Left the city once, not going back.  My work's in construction too. Drywall, T-bar. Hang it up, watch it grow. The desert, that's what draws folks here. The stark beauty of it, the way it bites back. The creatures, the things that crawl and fly, they need this place, need it protected. We share it, we learn to live with them. My kids, they're obsessed with lizards, bugs, chasing them through the scrub. We've adapted, alright.  There's things to do here, too. Victorville, it's a family place, different, maybe. They got a fair every year, San Bernardino County. A whole mess of fun, Victorville style. Go up to Wrightwood, see the snow on the mountains, maybe even try some winter sports. And if you want to know about the desert, the history of it, the museum. Rocks, bones, old things, they tell a story. The story of this place, of Victorville.",
            "They ask you to describe your neighborhood. A common enough question. Most would speak of lawns and picket fences, of porches and backyards. But my neighborhood… it’s different. It’s the cold brick and echoing halls of the dorm, the scattered lights in the windows like fallen stars. It’s the murmur of voices in the stairwells, the ghosts of laughter in the common rooms.  \n\nThere are houses here, yes.  But they’re not the kind you’d find in those picture books.  Apartments stacked like concrete hives, holding scores of souls in close quarters. There are houses too, older ones, two-storied and weathered, where the alumni hold court. And then there are the dorms, these sprawling, labyrinthine things, filled with the restless energy of youth. Each room a cage, each floor a world unto itself.\n\nPeople.\n\nA kaleidoscope of faces.  Young, old, from every corner of the earth.  The staff, their eyes weary but their purpose clear, live in the older houses, sentinels in the rising tide of students. The freshmen, wide-eyed and hopeful, huddle in the dorms, their lives a blur of lectures and late-night study sessions. The seniors, their faces etched with the weight of experience, seek refuge in the apartments, preparing for the world beyond these walls.\n\nThere are stores here too, feeding the hunger of this strange ecosystem.  Cafeterias that churn out endless platters of sustenance, cramped convenience stores stocked with necessities and junk food, a bookstore where dreams are bought and sold. And in the center of it all, a park. A small patch of green, a sanctuary from the concrete jungle.\n\nThis is my neighborhood. A microcosm of the world, contained within the confines of the campus. A place where lives intersect, where dreams are shaped, where futures are forged.",
            "Ten years. A decade in this place. I reckon I know a thing or two about it now. When I first came, from Riverdale to this Stockbridge place, the tears came easy. Missed them, I did. Loved them. But Mama and Papa, they were set on something better. Better houses, a better school. They called it moving up, said it was a blessing. Maybe it was. \n\nMade friends, made enemies. School does that. Never really got close to the neighbors, not much. Besides Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis for a spell. Good folks, those. Almost family, come to think of it. Remember Mr. Glen's wedding, him and Veda tying the knot again? Good time, that was. Old memories come back now, thinking about it. Me and Mama and Papa and my sister, all dancing the night away. Makes a man think about his own future, about building a life, finding a woman to share it with. A queen, maybe. I caught Veda's white strap when she tossed it, but not the flowers. Funny thing, that. \n\nThe neighborhood, it's a maze, all twists and turns. Got a GPS now, though. Helps a man navigate.  Kason and Curtis, those boys, we used to spend our time together. Video games, life in general.  \n\nSometimes I'd find myself at the park, just watching the trees sway. Makes a man feel small, in a good way. Brings a kind of peace. I practice with sticks, sometimes. Got a bokken too, a wooden sword. Keeps a man sharp. There's a court for basketball, a court for tennis. Haven't touched them in a while, but they're still there, waiting.  My old man, he used to make me and Curtis play tennis with Mr. Graves. Good times, those. He pushed us hard, but it was all in good fun. \n\nThis place, it's seen a lot.  I've seen a lot.  But the best, I reckon, is yet to come.",
            "The college sits close enough to walk, a thing I find some comfort in. The neighborhood's a patchwork of flats, a few dives and joints, none of them too hard on the purse. One bar just changed hands, prices gone up, but the whiskey's still whiskey. The people, mostly kids with books or folks scraping by, are alright. Kind enough. There's a school for young ones down the way, small fry running about. I don't know my neighbors, no need to. The smell of something green and sweet drifts from one door, choked by an air freshener that hangs like a mockery. The buildings themselves are old bones, some with new skins stretched over them. Down the road, they're building new, but slapdash. Cheap bones, high price tags. A scam, though the school draws them in like moths to a flame.\n\nThere's a greasy spoon a few minutes' walk, paper plates and microwaved meals, the kind that stick to your ribs. Across from it, a gas station, a place I hear the devil himself wouldn't work. But last summer they came through with a city grant, redid the road, put down new sidewalks, planted grass like a desperate attempt to dress up the place.\n\nMy building is choked by trees, some stumps where others fell. More woods behind, then another row of flats. 42nd Street, they call it. Behind me, 43rd, a shadow of its neighbor. Sidewalks cracked, buildings like teeth missing from a jaw. Trees there too, but maybe to hide the rot. Crime's a shadow in these parts, a whisper in the halls.  The flats across the street, they've seen their share, same as the ones down the road. \n\nBut I make do. Can afford it, close to the school. Two bus stops to the stores, the city proper. It's not much, but it's mine.",
            "The houses stood crammed together like a row of teeth, each a yellowed duplicate with white lips and tin roofs the color of spring grass.  The cul-de-sac was a dead end, a circle of quiet. Most of them knew each other, these families, their children sprawled like ants in the dust. The air hung thick with the drone of cicadas, the sun a white fist in the sky. It was a world apart from the machines and the cold lights of the city.  A world where the storms had teeth.\n\nThe sky had turned the color of bruised fruit that night, the wind a low moan in the trees.  The sirens screamed, a jagged edge against the quiet, and we all ran for cover. The bathtub, a porcelain ark, was where I waited, the small dog trembling in my arms, my purse clutched tight. The big one refused to budge, pacing the living room, a low growl rumbling in its chest.  The hail came down like a thousand icy fists, pounding the earth. The air grew thick with the smell of wet dust.\n\nThe storm passed, leaving a world washed clean. The road steamed, a ribbon of heat in the air. A rainbow, double-headed, unfurled across the sky. I ran inside, the camera clicking, capturing the impossible beauty.\n\nLater, as dusk settled, the children returned, their laughter ringing in the stillness. It was as if nothing had happened.  Life went on.\n\nThese houses, these families, they were my new world. A world of porch swings and sun-warmed faces. A world where the rooster's crow was the call to morning. A world where the donkey brayed at night, a lonely sound in the stillness. A world, for now, that felt like home.",
            "The sun bled low, staining the sky the color of old bruises.  That's when I moved in, just shy of eighth grade. The air hung heavy with the scent of cut grass and the ghosts of laughter from houses long empty. Found a couple of boys to share the dust with, two houses down and another a mile or so down the street. They're gone now, scattered like autumn leaves, but the memory of their laughter, the echo of their kicks against a rusted ball, it lingers still. \n\nMost folks who were here back then, they're still here. Same two-story houses, same sun-bleached lawns.  Weekends, when the heat presses down like a suffocating blanket, you can hear the young ones screaming, their joy a thin, sharp wire strung across the quiet streets. The houses are quiet most days, a silent tableau of lives unfolding behind closed doors. Never had a problem with a soul in this place.  You're left alone, until you need something. Then hands reach out, neighbors offering a helping hand, a shared meal.  Never had a package vanish from my porch, never had a door left ajar. Trust grows in this place, slow and sure as the creeping vines that choke the old oak by the road.\n\nThere's a park, a breath of green in the concrete sea. It's been my playground, my cathedral of memories.  Basketball, football, baseball -  the echoes of those games rise like dust devils in the summer wind.  Even the bad memories, the sting of a well-placed elbow, a nose bloodied, they fade. The good ones, the laughter, the camaraderie, those are etched in stone. Now, it's the small ones I see there, my cousin's children, their eyes wide with wonder, their laughter a bright counterpoint to the hushed whispers of the past.  They swing and slide, their joys a fragile, fleeting thing.  The park, it pulls at me, a tug of time, a reminder of innocence lost and found again.\n\nThis place, it's a tapestry woven with threads of different colors.  A hundred stories unfold in the symphony of smells that rise from the restaurants -  Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - a melting pot of flavors.  They say progress marches on, that now folks order their food through glowing rectangles, but the scent of simmering spices, the clinking of silverware, those things remain.  Fast food, it's everywhere, a greasy stain on the landscape. But there are good pizza places here, places that know the secret of dough and sauce and fire. You need something, you'll find it here.  Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store -  even an Indian shop, if you're looking for a taste of home.\n\nIt's a good place, this neighborhood. Reading about the horrors, the violence, the fear that plagues other places, it makes me appreciate the quiet, the stillness, the unspoken trust that binds us here. This is where I belong, where the roots run deep and the memories linger like the smoke from a dying fire.",
            "The town sits hunkered down in the South Carolina lowcountry, a nondescript patch of earth given over to the orchard and the range. Johnston. They call it the Peach Capital of the World, a boast scrawled across the town's welcome sign like a faded promise. Peach trees and cattle, that's what stretches to the horizon. Houses, if you can call them that, are scattered like tumbleweeds, two stories most of 'em, metal roofs gleaming under the sun or gray shingles sagging with the weight of years. Set back from the road, leaving the front fields for the livestock and crops that sustain this place.  \n\nDown in the town's belly, where the road cuts four ways, hangs a single, lonely stoplight. That's where the commerce gathers. A trio of fast food joints: Hong Kong, a family's meager operation serving up Chinese food; Fiesta, a splash of Mexican in this bland landscape; and Gary's, a chain spitting out burgers that taste like regret. A pizzeria used to be there, but it went belly up a while back. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family affair, peddling pills and cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, the only grocery in town, but folks head to Batesburg-Leesville for their real provisions. Dollar General, though, that's where the town's heartbeat resides. A plastic haven of necessities, packed from dawn till dusk. And then there's Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a woman with a kind face and a lifetime of stories, her shop attached to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where they pamper the town's furry companions. \n\nA doctor's office and a vet's, both small, both struggling to keep pace with the town's needs. Johnston Elementary, a brick box where the youngest learn their ABCs. Beyond that, the kids gotta ride the bus to the next town for middle and high school. No parks, no theaters, no bowling alleys, just the endless fields and the quiet hum of a town that's content to exist, unnoticed, on the edge of time.",
            "The name of the place first came to me on some tinny podcast, voices whispering of vanishings. It struck odd. Every box in this town held a price tag north of a thousand a month. Never heard a word of it, neither had my friends. The weight of it all, perhaps. I know a few of them, they cry themselves to sleep. The cost of living. It claws at you. But we've learned to be lean. You start savoring the dust on flea market toys, the smell of mothballed clothes. You smell less, that's for sure. You might take up a smoke, or maybe you just get used to the stink. But the flea market, it sticks with you. The scent of this life, it's dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It burrows in the leather, stays there even after you wash it clean. Here, three thrift shops you can reach on foot. Start at the far edge, and you can walk past two charity bins, a library, a place for the old and rare, and a shop full of oddities. Downtown, the streets swarm. Cars and bodies pressed together, every morning. But in the thrift shops, it's quiet. Doesn't matter how many souls pass by, the silence holds. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more and more of them come. The cars, the people, it floods in. A growing city, they say. This one of the big online empires, headquarters here, delivering things to the world. Still got its growing pains. Reminds me of New York. Everyone chasing their own ghost, no one asking much of you. You can be alone, quiet, stay in your corner, and no one bats an eye. Not like down South, where concern means you care. Here, they leave you to your own devices. You can keep your walls up as high as you want, and the city goes on, crashing and rolling like waves on the shore.  Lively place, this one. Between the pianist next door and the two amateurs upstairs belting out tunes, there's always something happening. It's more a community than a collection of strangers, some of us. We come together. Birthdays, funerals, help each other when we can. Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of the neighbors are alright. They treat me right. I keep my place tidy, leave them a plate of food now and then, and they do the same. I bring their mail, they bring mine. It's good to see them, and I think they're glad to see me too. A giant, cold, concrete beast this place is. But it's folks like my neighbors that make it feel like maybe, just maybe, I didn't screw everything up.",
            "The place I call home stretches out flat and baked beneath the sun. You might call it suburbia, but the word feels hollow, like a rusting tin can kicked down the road.  Everywhere you look, houses huddle together, each one a mirror image of the last.  Same neat lawns, same gravel dust, same two-car garages where metal beasts sleep. The air hangs thick with the smell of cut grass and a kind of sterile quiet.  They call it order, this sameness.  They call it security.  \n\nThere's a master plan here, etched in concrete and manicured hedges.  The mailboxes stand like sentinels, a metal row huddled together at the end of the road, a key the only passport to belonging.  No individual plots, no whispers of individuality.  A pool shimmers in the distance, a blue rectangle of manufactured joy.  Walking trails snake through the green carpet, a place to purge the restless energy that comes with knowing too much, knowing too little.  \n\nThe houses themselves are mostly one story, though some rise up with a second floor, a second chance at escape.  Folks here are mostly old, their bones settling into this place like stones in a dry riverbed.  A few younger faces flit in and out, chasing some phantom dream of stability.  \n\nThe city, a sprawling thing of brick and steel, lies just beyond the edge of this ordered world.  A mall, the size of a small town, stands as a monument to consumption, a place where the ghosts of choice wander amongst the aisles.  Fifteen minutes in the car, a journey through sterile landscapes and the hum of engines, and you’re there.  \n\nThis place, it's safe.  Everyone knows everyone, or at least they know the stories.  It's a place where the past whispers in the wind, a place where the future feels like a broken record. It's a place to be comfortable, a place to fade away.",
            "The town sits low, a hollowed-out place wedged between the sprawl and the city's hungry maw. East side, they call it. Where the houses huddle close, weary bones against the wind. A lot of folks here lean hard to keep their heads above water, pockets thin, lives worn. But there's a kind of grit in the air, a stubborn hope that clings to the porch swings and the faded paint.\n\nNeighbors wave, faces creased with the stories of a life lived hard. The street's a thin thread of cracked asphalt, the air thick with the smell of burning leaves and regret.  A few times, the silence has been shattered, the echo of gunfire a hollow drumbeat against the night. Lost a boy, the family next door. Gunfire in the dark, spilled blood on the pavement. They say the devil's got a hold of this town, whispers carried on the wind. Fentanyl, they call it. A slow death, a cold hand reaching in. But there are whispers of hope too. Places where folks try to claw their way back, a fighting chance against the tide.\n\nMy son, he goes to school. A haven in the dust. Good folks there, teachers with tired eyes but a fierce love for the kids. He's got needs, special needs, but they treat him like gold. The school feeds the hungry, clothes the naked, and tries to mend the broken.  The town's got its scars, its wounds. But there's a beauty in the broken places, a resilience that shines through the cracks. It's a town that stays in your bones, a place where you can't help but feel the weight of its history, the ache of its heart. This is home.",
            "The Hill holds her. Buildings claw at the sky, ghosts of a time when things were different. Seven stories high, my own wall stares out across the street at the old theater, its marquee dark and dusty. A block down, the neon glow of the arcade bar spills out onto the sidewalk, drawing a swarm of souls on the warm nights. June and July, the line snakes out the door, a promise of fleeting joy. A few paces up, the park, a concrete island in a sea of brick. Tall steps rise from the ground, a cold stone embrace in winter. Then the men come, huddled in rows, their tents a ragged tapestry against the gray. Not much snow here, but the rain, the rain comes down in torrents, a relentless curtain in the heart of winter.  Closer to the warmth, the city's heart, they make their stand. In the distance, the Family Center, a beacon of some small solace.\n\nThey don't forget, these people. The Hill, once a scar on the West Coast, a name whispered in fear. The stories linger, tales of agents and raids, a war fought in shadows. Three decades gone, but the ghosts remain. They work, these people, cleaning the streets, holding onto what little dignity they have. They say, if you're white, don't walk alone after dark. A warning, a shadow from the past. Or maybe, just maybe, they see something in me. A darkness that blurs the lines. Perhaps they recognize the ache, the constant vigilance, the reminders that plague us all. The fear, the ignorance, the weight of assumptions.\n\nHilltop, it's home. The streets hum at night, a symphony of life and struggle. They offer me warmth, kindness, a shoulder against the cold. Someone keeps a laundromat open, a flicker of light in the darkness. A stranger looks me in the eye, hands me five dollars, whispers, \"You're beautiful, you're valuable.\" And in that moment, I believe it.",
            "The country holds me here. Small town Michigan, where fields give way to towns strung like beads on a faded map. No city sprawls, no chains, no neon glow. Just the long road, the engine's hum, and the dust rising behind. But the land, it holds beauty. Water, on all sides. Lake Michigan, a cold vastness, and Charlevoix, smaller, but no less stark. Beaches everywhere, sun-bleached sand and the whisper of waves.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's the bones of a place, each house a story etched in wood and stone. Not stacked high, but spread out, breathing. Some renewed, some weathered, each with a basement, a darkness below. Aluminum siding, the color of rain, covers many. Houses of every shade, like a forgotten box of crayons, line the streets. Yards, green and unruly, with swings that creak and the ghosts of laughter. Gardens, fences, dogs barking. The scent of cut grass, of woodsmoke in the evening. Hardworking folks, raising families, the lifeblood of the place.\n\nChildren run, their laughter echoing in the quiet. Dogs chase squirrels, old men sit on porches, rocking slowly. A wave, a nod, a shared silence. The lawnmower's drone, the rumble of a passing car. It's not a place of flash or grandeur, but a place where you can feel the earth beneath your feet, where the sun sets slow and the moon rises heavy. Safe. A place to be rooted, to find solace.\n\nThe sheriff's station, a stoic stone sentinel, stands watch. The health department, a quiet presence. The recycling center, a place of quiet industry. Even the airport, a small thing, with its whispers of engines, feels like a part of the rhythm of this place. An ice cream parlor, a few blocks away, where the scent of waffle cones hangs heavy in the air. The park, eight blocks, a place for children to run free.\n\nIt's a place that whispers of belonging, of community. A place, maybe, where you can finally find your way home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city sprawls, a concrete and steel expanse where the line between living and commerce blurs. Brick and glass buildings rise like sentinels, their shadows stretching long and thin across streets choked with metal beasts. Here, in the belly of this beast, a million different lives play out, a symphony of honking horns and sirens, of laughter and despair. \n\nThere are pockets of green, patches of grass struggling to survive amidst the asphalt, where mothers push strollers and children chase pigeons. But the concrete holds fast.  \n\nThe faces I see are a tapestry woven from different threads – a man in a kippah, a woman with a rainbow flag pinned to her jacket, a young girl with eyes as dark as the night sky, her tongue lost in the melodies of a language I don't know. They come and go, these souls, each with their stories, their sorrows, their dreams. \n\nWe live in a city of fragments, places carved out for different tribes – Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia – each a world unto itself.  Ten miles, they say, can be a journey of hours, a slow crawl through a river of steel. \n\nThe air hangs thick with exhaust, the sky a bruised gray canvas. Buildings rise, ever higher, monuments to progress, to ambition. More people, they say, more dreams. But what happens to the dreams when they're all crammed into a space too small to hold them? \n\nInside my own small world, there are echoes of a different time, a time when children played without fear, when neighbors knew each other's names. Now, the houses stand silent, their windows like vacant eyes staring out at the city's relentless pulse.",
            "The houses here are mostly single, each a kind of box with a porch, though a few have been split in two, joined at the hip but separate souls. My own sits with a small patch of grass in front, a cracked concrete path leading to the door. It's the kind of place that whispers of a time not so far gone when the suburbs were the promise. That promise, it felt like it could hold the whole country, but now it's pulling back, like water receding from the shore. Still, these houses stand, these yards hold on, a testament to a dream still waiting to be realized. \n\nThe faces here, they don't wear the same hopeful masks they used to. The lawns are patchy, the paint peels. But the driveways hold cars, and the kids, they run free, oblivious to the world beyond the crack in the sidewalk. The school, old as sin, still stands, a beacon for the young, a ghost for the old. Churches are scattered like forgotten prayers, mostly empty. But the blacktop courts, they're alive. Basketball echoes in the twilight.\n\nThey all look different, these houses, but they feel the same. A supermarket, Super \"A,\" owned by a family from a faraway land, Yemen maybe. The only ones like them in this sea of brown faces. Streets stretch wide, empty save for children kicking a ball, pausing only for the rumble of a car passing through. Most folks here, they've been rooted in this soil for generations, their stories etched in the lines on their faces. They remember when everyone knew each other's name, when the karate school on the corner was packed, before Hollywood decided those stories weren't worth telling anymore. Now it's a pharmacy, dispensing pills like promises. \n\nThere's a small movie theater, showing flicks from another time, a refuge for the old, ignored by the young. An expressway cuts through the town next door, a scar on the landscape. We wanted a ramp, a connection to the world, but the elders said no. Too much change, they whispered. Now they're building a new school, and we're arguing about a mascot. A cyborg with a country drawl, a log cabin on its back. Maybe that's what we are, a contradiction held together by the rust of time.",
            "The place might pass you by. A quiet stretch behind a strip of fading storefronts. Not the sort of place folks think to look for a life, or the kind most would want. But past the husk of the old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty save for the ghosts of summer families, lies a world unseen. \n\nBack there, nestled tight as dolls in a box, are a line of apartments. Each one a piece of a story no one tells.  The first ones, those you see on the news, with their whispers of ill deeds, best left undisturbed. But the ones beside them, the ones hidden in the shadows, hold a truth unknown.\n\nAcross the road, a college campus waits, its buildings quiet and watchful. Students drift in, coffee cups in hand, eyes heavy against the dawn. The iron gates creak, admitting them one by one, while cars fume and impatient fists shake from the windows.\n\nThe road forks, leading to another street, a park on one side, a rehab center on the other.  The center boasts a porch swing and a fan that stirs the thick, humid air.  Children run through the grass, their laughter a thin echo in the heat. Old folks walk their dogs, their eyes fixed on the ground, scowling at the teenagers carving their stories on skateboards. \n\nA strip mall stands sentinel, a sushi place tucked next to a swimming supply store, a nail salon nestled in between.  Frozen yogurt, bright and cold, spills from cups clutched by teens, their faces flushed with the heat and the sting of cheap rebellion.\n\nThis place, this slice of the South, it holds fast to a time that slips away elsewhere. A history written in chipped paint and worn sidewalks, a story whispered in the rustle of leaves and the hum of cicadas.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she asked, the words thin as the sky above the endless corn. We rolled past fields stretching to the horizon, a sea of green under the sun's relentless gaze. \"This is it,\" I said, knowing the sight would steal her breath. \n\nShe came from a town where the world was crowded, where the grocery store was a heartbeat away. Open space like this was a language she didn't know. The cornfields pressed in on her, an alien landscape. I told her of growing up in the heart of Ohio, of the dirt under my fingernails and the sky so wide it felt like it could swallow you whole. In those words, she saw me, finally, the boy I'd always been.\n\nDown the two-lane blacktop, past a quarry choked with water, lay the development. Brick and stucco houses, each one a stone island in a sea of green. Half an acre of land, at least, to each one, and they guarded it fiercely. Spring brought a riot of color, flowers spilling across the lawns like spilled paint. The trees, they lived and died with the seasons, shedding their leaves like tired bones. In the driveways, gleaming in the midday heat, sat the silver beasts: Mercedes, gleaming like sins. \n\nAs we neared my own house, a grey stucco box, our neighbor emerged. Korean, with a face creased by time and a smile that never faded. He spent his days wrestling the lawn, his mower a humming beast, his voice rising above it in a song I couldn't understand.  They laughed at him, but he was a good man, a doctor once, lost in the green wilderness of his yard. He moved slow now, his wit dulled, his eyes lost in the horizon.\n\nMy house. A thin stream ran behind it, feeding into the quarry. Bullfrogs croaked in the twilight, a lonely cow moaned in the distance. A handmade wooden bridge crossed the stream, leading to a haven untouched by man. Trees, herbs, wildflowers, a secret world where I'd spent my childhood. Forts built of branches, games of chase played in the fading light. Friendships forged in the dust and the heat, memories etched in the bark of the trees.\n\nWinter came like a fist, brutal and unforgiving. The world turned white, the grass died, the trees stood bare. Snow angels in the yard, snowmen with coal eyes, and my sister, my constant companion, my rival. Snowballs flew, forts were built, battles waged in the white silence. We were kings and queens of our own winter kingdom, young and fearless, nothing but the cold and the snow between us and forever.",
            "The truth is, Portland ain't for the faint of heart. You gotta understand what \"weird\" means here. It ain't some quaint notion, some tourist trap. It's etched on the back of a greasy spoon, a place where the aroma of pizza mingles with the stench of cheap beer and the muffled music of some forgotten band. On that same sign, they say \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some folks, they see it as a relic, a memory of a time when this town was hidden, cheap, a haven for the offbeat. Others, they see it as a promise, an invitation to come be different, to find your tribe in the shadows.  \n\nEven now, with Californians pouring in like locusts, their bank accounts bloated and their eyes hungry for the next avocado toast, Portland still breathes a certain kind of strangeness. It ain't a blind acceptance, no. We got our share of fights, our petty squabbles, our wars fought over parking spaces and the price of coffee. We buy our things from the same factories as everyone else, churn out the same anxieties and dreams. But there's a difference. We wear it different.\n\nOut here, in these streets, you see old houses painted in colors that would make a church deacon faint. Gardens bloom with flowers and herbs, vegetables spilling over the fences like a curse. And then there are the boxes. These cardboard monoliths, filled with someone else's castoffs, left on the curb like offerings to the gods of chance. Clothes, books, broken toys, you never know what you'll find. Sometimes it's a faded photograph, a glimpse into someone else's life. Sometimes it's a book that speaks to your soul. It's a reminder that even in the midst of this concrete jungle, there's still a touch of magic.\n\nAnd that's Portland to me. A place where the ordinary is imbued with a strange, unsettling beauty. A place where you can be yourself, whatever that means, without judgment.\n\nBut don't mistake it for a utopia. We got our problems. Drugs gnaw at the edges, a slow, insidious rot. People sleep on the streets, ghosts in a city that's too busy to see them. \n\nWe're not so different from the rest of the world, after all.",
            "The mountains. They are always there. In the north. Bearing witness. To the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawn. Dusk. It matters not how far the mind wanders, how lost in the work and the worry, they stand. Unbowed. Undeterred. \n\nThey demand to be seen on the days when the soul is frayed. When the mind is a knotted rope. And in their stark presence, a kind of peace. A strength to see the next hour through.\n\nCame here first for the books, the learning. But it was the mountains, north of the campus, that drew the eye. The university, with its brick and mortar, its ponds and courtyards, it holds a place. But the mountains, they are the king.\n\nThe town itself, it has a quiet grace. Cafés that hum with the drone of thought, fueled by bitter coffee. A downtown, a heartbeat closer. Faded brick, the ghosts of merchants past. A city's spirit, but compressed, contained. Then, a turn, a breath, and the quiet returns. The library, a line drawn in the sand, separating the two.\n\nA town living in the shadow of a city. Contradictions held close.\n\nMemories bloom here. Swings creaking in the park, the laughter of friends, the sting of a late-night realization. The rush of the downtown, the glow of the theater, a ticket bought with stolen time.\n\nBut there are sorrows too. The ponds, still and reflective, a place for tears in the dead of night. An existential ache, a question mark etched on the soul. Watching the turtles move, the ducks preen, the insects scrabble, a question arises: what is my place in this?\n\nSteps taken, past the pond, past the houses, small and neat, whispers of suburbia. Then, a main street. The sun, a blaze of gold, crowns the palms. Upward, the eyes rise. North.\n\nThere they are. The mountains. Silent, enduring. A promise. They stand against the dying light, a silent language understood. Perseverance.",
            "The road to Bensonhurst ain't hard to find. The iron horse and the rumbling buses, they snake through the city like veins, carrying you to this corner of it. It ain't no wilderness, that's for sure. Brick and steel, all around, the city's breath on your neck. But there's a different scent here, a whisper of spice and incense, a tide of East come meetin' West.  \n\nEverywhere you walk, the shops bear the mark of a new world. Grocery stores stacked high with unfamiliar fruits, laundromats humming with the ghosts of a thousand stories. The locals swear by 'em, say the food's good, the prices cheap, and the convenience, well, that's a prayer answered. Four of them, just a stone's throw from where I stand.\n\nBut don't think it's all chop suey and dumplings. This place, it's a tapestry woven from threads of every hue.  Folks from every corner, first and second generation, all tryin' to make their place under the sun. \n\nThere's a park nearby, all green and fresh, with courts for ball games and a playground for the young'uns. Even a fountain to splash in when the sun beats down. And like the city itself, it's a melting pot of faces, a symphony of languages.\n\nThere ain't no towering giants here, no corporate monoliths. Mostly it's houses, two families sharing a stoop, lookin' out on the street. People are decent enough, though the noise, it never sleeps. Cars roar past, bass thumpin' like the pulse of the city itself. Wake you up in the mornin', that's for sure.\n\nNighttime's a different beast. Keep your eyes open, your wits sharper. The city's a wild thing, and there are shadows that lurk in every corner.  I've seen my share of trouble here, felt the sting of a fist, the sting of a stolen package.  \n\nAnd the dogs, Lord have mercy on the dogs.  \n\nThey leave their mark on every sidewalk, a constant reminder that even in this concrete jungle, nature finds a way.",
            "The streets here are few and far between. A slope of dust and scrub, the land falls away, and the house sits perched atop the highest rise. The locals call it the \"workout hill,\" a steady climb for the runners that come to test their legs. No sidewalk exists, the road itself a ribbon black against the green, pitted and scarred in places. The wires overhead, strung thin and brittle, hang low, a tangled web of copper and weathered wood. Rain comes often, a shroud of grey, and the wind tears loose branches and limbs. They strike the lines, weaving a patchwork of repairs across the landscape. \n\nEvergreens crowd the hillsides, thick and silent. But the people here, they hate them. They hack and slash, craving the open view of the water.  So the houses rise, gaunt and glassy, clawing at the sky, their second stories gaping like eyes. At dusk, the water bleeds color, a fiery orange beneath a bruised sky. But the light is fleeting, swallowed by the clouds that hang heavy, a perpetual dampness clinging to the air. Moss spreads like a disease, creeping over everything: roofs, rusted cars, the iron railings. Once left my truck in the drive for a month. Came back to find it draped in a green shroud, furry and thick. Took three hours to scrape it clean.\n\nChildren are scarce, a few strays glimpsed at the schoolhouse down the way. Mostly, it's the old folk, their lives spent, their days long and slow. Dogs fill the void. They roam the lawns, barking at the wind, chasing each other down the road. A loose door, a window left ajar, and they'll slip inside, their eyes bright and curious. Found one once in the living room, a rust-colored blur, had to shoo it back out into the dust.\n\nRabbits scurry, fattened on wild clover, a nuisance to the gardeners. They burrow and tear, leaving trails of destruction in their wake. But the cats, they relish the chase. The neighborhood is a hunting ground. Hawks and eagles wheel overhead, their shadows fleeting, chased away by the raucous cries of crows. \n\nNo shops or stores, just the whisper of the sea. Down by the water, a few restaurants, serving the catch of the day. The beach is but a sliver of sand, but the rocks are tempting, smooth and cold beneath the hand. They cast a long arc, a splash of white against the grey, before sinking into the depths. The bay is narrow, the other shore a hazy line on the horizon.",
            "The house sits on the corner. Two ways in and two ways out. A street that cuts through the town like a scar. You see them all come and go. Cars like metal beetles crawling along.  Folks busy with the work of it all. Lawns mown close, chores done.  Winter brings the children down the hill on their sleds,  a fleeting taste of joy in the grey light. We are home a lot. Wife, daughters, myself. Eleven and fourteen. The house breathes with us. Sometimes the rain comes down and the girls run barefoot in the puddles. Smoke from the grill hangs heavy in the air, a promise of something warm. Grass grows like a green tide, relentless.  And in the fall, the leaves fall, a brown shroud over the earth. We burn them, the smell a whisper of what is coming. The winters are fading. A long, slow burn, not a crisp bite.  The garage is at the back, a sanctuary.  Doors open and the world slips in, a symphony of car engines and lawnmowers. Holidays bring a flurry of strangers, cars crowding the street.  Then silence again. A quiet that settles deep in the bones. It's a place. A place to hold.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust, sun-bleached dust, stretches to the horizon. You wouldn't understand it unless you'd lived here, breathed it in. Seen the brown, day after day, and the rare splash of green, a lawn manicured to death, a testament to some man's obsession. Back in the 90s, the houses were scattered, a breath between them. Now, they're closer. More of them. A creeping city, though most places are the same way, swallowed whole.  Folks are mostly decent, like anywhere else, good and bad mixed in the stew. Mostly old folks around here, friendly. A decent enough place. Stores are chain places, Food 4 Less, Smart & Final. Want something fancy, you gotta drive. No Whole Foods here, not in this dustbowl. Construction's the trade that runs this town, at least as far as I can see. Still lots of open land, they're building on it fast. Scares me, I like it this way, quiet. Left the city once, not going back.  My work's in construction too. Drywall, T-bar. Hang it up, watch it grow. The desert, that's what draws folks here. The stark beauty of it, the way it bites back. The creatures, the things that crawl and fly, they need this place, need it protected. We share it, we learn to live with them. My kids, they're obsessed with lizards, bugs, chasing them through the scrub. We've adapted, alright.  There's things to do here, too. Victorville, it's a family place, different, maybe. They got a fair every year, San Bernardino County. A whole mess of fun, Victorville style. Go up to Wrightwood, see the snow on the mountains, maybe even try some winter sports. And if you want to know about the desert, the history of it, the museum. Rocks, bones, old things, they tell a story. The story of this place, of Victorville.",
            "They ask you to describe your neighborhood. A common enough question. Most would speak of lawns and picket fences, of porches and backyards. But my neighborhood… it’s different. It’s the cold brick and echoing halls of the dorm, the scattered lights in the windows like fallen stars. It’s the murmur of voices in the stairwells, the ghosts of laughter in the common rooms.  \n\nThere are houses here, yes.  But they’re not the kind you’d find in those picture books.  Apartments stacked like concrete hives, holding scores of souls in close quarters. There are houses too, older ones, two-storied and weathered, where the alumni hold court. And then there are the dorms, these sprawling, labyrinthine things, filled with the restless energy of youth. Each room a cage, each floor a world unto itself.\n\nPeople.\n\nA kaleidoscope of faces.  Young, old, from every corner of the earth.  The staff, their eyes weary but their purpose clear, live in the older houses, sentinels in the rising tide of students. The freshmen, wide-eyed and hopeful, huddle in the dorms, their lives a blur of lectures and late-night study sessions. The seniors, their faces etched with the weight of experience, seek refuge in the apartments, preparing for the world beyond these walls.\n\nThere are stores here too, feeding the hunger of this strange ecosystem.  Cafeterias that churn out endless platters of sustenance, cramped convenience stores stocked with necessities and junk food, a bookstore where dreams are bought and sold. And in the center of it all, a park. A small patch of green, a sanctuary from the concrete jungle.\n\nThis is my neighborhood. A microcosm of the world, contained within the confines of the campus. A place where lives intersect, where dreams are shaped, where futures are forged.",
            "Ten years. A decade in this place. I reckon I know a thing or two about it now. When I first came, from Riverdale to this Stockbridge place, the tears came easy. Missed them, I did. Loved them. But Mama and Papa, they were set on something better. Better houses, a better school. They called it moving up, said it was a blessing. Maybe it was. \n\nMade friends, made enemies. School does that. Never really got close to the neighbors, not much. Besides Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis for a spell. Good folks, those. Almost family, come to think of it. Remember Mr. Glen's wedding, him and Veda tying the knot again? Good time, that was. Old memories come back now, thinking about it. Me and Mama and Papa and my sister, all dancing the night away. Makes a man think about his own future, about building a life, finding a woman to share it with. A queen, maybe. I caught Veda's white strap when she tossed it, but not the flowers. Funny thing, that. \n\nThe neighborhood, it's a maze, all twists and turns. Got a GPS now, though. Helps a man navigate.  Kason and Curtis, those boys, we used to spend our time together. Video games, life in general.  \n\nSometimes I'd find myself at the park, just watching the trees sway. Makes a man feel small, in a good way. Brings a kind of peace. I practice with sticks, sometimes. Got a bokken too, a wooden sword. Keeps a man sharp. There's a court for basketball, a court for tennis. Haven't touched them in a while, but they're still there, waiting.  My old man, he used to make me and Curtis play tennis with Mr. Graves. Good times, those. He pushed us hard, but it was all in good fun. \n\nThis place, it's seen a lot.  I've seen a lot.  But the best, I reckon, is yet to come.",
            "The college sits close enough to walk, a thing I find some comfort in. The neighborhood's a patchwork of flats, a few dives and joints, none of them too hard on the purse. One bar just changed hands, prices gone up, but the whiskey's still whiskey. The people, mostly kids with books or folks scraping by, are alright. Kind enough. There's a school for young ones down the way, small fry running about. I don't know my neighbors, no need to. The smell of something green and sweet drifts from one door, choked by an air freshener that hangs like a mockery. The buildings themselves are old bones, some with new skins stretched over them. Down the road, they're building new, but slapdash. Cheap bones, high price tags. A scam, though the school draws them in like moths to a flame.\n\nThere's a greasy spoon a few minutes' walk, paper plates and microwaved meals, the kind that stick to your ribs. Across from it, a gas station, a place I hear the devil himself wouldn't work. But last summer they came through with a city grant, redid the road, put down new sidewalks, planted grass like a desperate attempt to dress up the place.\n\nMy building is choked by trees, some stumps where others fell. More woods behind, then another row of flats. 42nd Street, they call it. Behind me, 43rd, a shadow of its neighbor. Sidewalks cracked, buildings like teeth missing from a jaw. Trees there too, but maybe to hide the rot. Crime's a shadow in these parts, a whisper in the halls.  The flats across the street, they've seen their share, same as the ones down the road. \n\nBut I make do. Can afford it, close to the school. Two bus stops to the stores, the city proper. It's not much, but it's mine.",
            "The houses stood crammed together like a row of teeth, each a yellowed duplicate with white lips and tin roofs the color of spring grass.  The cul-de-sac was a dead end, a circle of quiet. Most of them knew each other, these families, their children sprawled like ants in the dust. The air hung thick with the drone of cicadas, the sun a white fist in the sky. It was a world apart from the machines and the cold lights of the city.  A world where the storms had teeth.\n\nThe sky had turned the color of bruised fruit that night, the wind a low moan in the trees.  The sirens screamed, a jagged edge against the quiet, and we all ran for cover. The bathtub, a porcelain ark, was where I waited, the small dog trembling in my arms, my purse clutched tight. The big one refused to budge, pacing the living room, a low growl rumbling in its chest.  The hail came down like a thousand icy fists, pounding the earth. The air grew thick with the smell of wet dust.\n\nThe storm passed, leaving a world washed clean. The road steamed, a ribbon of heat in the air. A rainbow, double-headed, unfurled across the sky. I ran inside, the camera clicking, capturing the impossible beauty.\n\nLater, as dusk settled, the children returned, their laughter ringing in the stillness. It was as if nothing had happened.  Life went on.\n\nThese houses, these families, they were my new world. A world of porch swings and sun-warmed faces. A world where the rooster's crow was the call to morning. A world where the donkey brayed at night, a lonely sound in the stillness. A world, for now, that felt like home.",
            "The sun bled low, staining the sky the color of old bruises.  That's when I moved in, just shy of eighth grade. The air hung heavy with the scent of cut grass and the ghosts of laughter from houses long empty. Found a couple of boys to share the dust with, two houses down and another a mile or so down the street. They're gone now, scattered like autumn leaves, but the memory of their laughter, the echo of their kicks against a rusted ball, it lingers still. \n\nMost folks who were here back then, they're still here. Same two-story houses, same sun-bleached lawns.  Weekends, when the heat presses down like a suffocating blanket, you can hear the young ones screaming, their joy a thin, sharp wire strung across the quiet streets. The houses are quiet most days, a silent tableau of lives unfolding behind closed doors. Never had a problem with a soul in this place.  You're left alone, until you need something. Then hands reach out, neighbors offering a helping hand, a shared meal.  Never had a package vanish from my porch, never had a door left ajar. Trust grows in this place, slow and sure as the creeping vines that choke the old oak by the road.\n\nThere's a park, a breath of green in the concrete sea. It's been my playground, my cathedral of memories.  Basketball, football, baseball -  the echoes of those games rise like dust devils in the summer wind.  Even the bad memories, the sting of a well-placed elbow, a nose bloodied, they fade. The good ones, the laughter, the camaraderie, those are etched in stone. Now, it's the small ones I see there, my cousin's children, their eyes wide with wonder, their laughter a bright counterpoint to the hushed whispers of the past.  They swing and slide, their joys a fragile, fleeting thing.  The park, it pulls at me, a tug of time, a reminder of innocence lost and found again.\n\nThis place, it's a tapestry woven with threads of different colors.  A hundred stories unfold in the symphony of smells that rise from the restaurants -  Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - a melting pot of flavors.  They say progress marches on, that now folks order their food through glowing rectangles, but the scent of simmering spices, the clinking of silverware, those things remain.  Fast food, it's everywhere, a greasy stain on the landscape. But there are good pizza places here, places that know the secret of dough and sauce and fire. You need something, you'll find it here.  Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store -  even an Indian shop, if you're looking for a taste of home.\n\nIt's a good place, this neighborhood. Reading about the horrors, the violence, the fear that plagues other places, it makes me appreciate the quiet, the stillness, the unspoken trust that binds us here. This is where I belong, where the roots run deep and the memories linger like the smoke from a dying fire.",
            "The town sits hunkered down in the South Carolina lowcountry, a nondescript patch of earth given over to the orchard and the range. Johnston. They call it the Peach Capital of the World, a boast scrawled across the town's welcome sign like a faded promise. Peach trees and cattle, that's what stretches to the horizon. Houses, if you can call them that, are scattered like tumbleweeds, two stories most of 'em, metal roofs gleaming under the sun or gray shingles sagging with the weight of years. Set back from the road, leaving the front fields for the livestock and crops that sustain this place.  \n\nDown in the town's belly, where the road cuts four ways, hangs a single, lonely stoplight. That's where the commerce gathers. A trio of fast food joints: Hong Kong, a family's meager operation serving up Chinese food; Fiesta, a splash of Mexican in this bland landscape; and Gary's, a chain spitting out burgers that taste like regret. A pizzeria used to be there, but it went belly up a while back. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family affair, peddling pills and cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, the only grocery in town, but folks head to Batesburg-Leesville for their real provisions. Dollar General, though, that's where the town's heartbeat resides. A plastic haven of necessities, packed from dawn till dusk. And then there's Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a woman with a kind face and a lifetime of stories, her shop attached to Clark's Cuts and Kennels, where they pamper the town's furry companions. \n\nA doctor's office and a vet's, both small, both struggling to keep pace with the town's needs. Johnston Elementary, a brick box where the youngest learn their ABCs. Beyond that, the kids gotta ride the bus to the next town for middle and high school. No parks, no theaters, no bowling alleys, just the endless fields and the quiet hum of a town that's content to exist, unnoticed, on the edge of time.",
            "The name of the place first came to me on some tinny podcast, voices whispering of vanishings. It struck odd. Every box in this town held a price tag north of a thousand a month. Never heard a word of it, neither had my friends. The weight of it all, perhaps. I know a few of them, they cry themselves to sleep. The cost of living. It claws at you. But we've learned to be lean. You start savoring the dust on flea market toys, the smell of mothballed clothes. You smell less, that's for sure. You might take up a smoke, or maybe you just get used to the stink. But the flea market, it sticks with you. The scent of this life, it's dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It burrows in the leather, stays there even after you wash it clean. Here, three thrift shops you can reach on foot. Start at the far edge, and you can walk past two charity bins, a library, a place for the old and rare, and a shop full of oddities. Downtown, the streets swarm. Cars and bodies pressed together, every morning. But in the thrift shops, it's quiet. Doesn't matter how many souls pass by, the silence holds. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more and more of them come. The cars, the people, it floods in. A growing city, they say. This one of the big online empires, headquarters here, delivering things to the world. Still got its growing pains. Reminds me of New York. Everyone chasing their own ghost, no one asking much of you. You can be alone, quiet, stay in your corner, and no one bats an eye. Not like down South, where concern means you care. Here, they leave you to your own devices. You can keep your walls up as high as you want, and the city goes on, crashing and rolling like waves on the shore.  Lively place, this one. Between the pianist next door and the two amateurs upstairs belting out tunes, there's always something happening. It's more a community than a collection of strangers, some of us. We come together. Birthdays, funerals, help each other when we can. Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of the neighbors are alright. They treat me right. I keep my place tidy, leave them a plate of food now and then, and they do the same. I bring their mail, they bring mine. It's good to see them, and I think they're glad to see me too. A giant, cold, concrete beast this place is. But it's folks like my neighbors that make it feel like maybe, just maybe, I didn't screw everything up.",
            "The place I call home stretches out flat and baked beneath the sun. You might call it suburbia, but the word feels hollow, like a rusting tin can kicked down the road.  Everywhere you look, houses huddle together, each one a mirror image of the last.  Same neat lawns, same gravel dust, same two-car garages where metal beasts sleep. The air hangs thick with the smell of cut grass and a kind of sterile quiet.  They call it order, this sameness.  They call it security.  \n\nThere's a master plan here, etched in concrete and manicured hedges.  The mailboxes stand like sentinels, a metal row huddled together at the end of the road, a key the only passport to belonging.  No individual plots, no whispers of individuality.  A pool shimmers in the distance, a blue rectangle of manufactured joy.  Walking trails snake through the green carpet, a place to purge the restless energy that comes with knowing too much, knowing too little.  \n\nThe houses themselves are mostly one story, though some rise up with a second floor, a second chance at escape.  Folks here are mostly old, their bones settling into this place like stones in a dry riverbed.  A few younger faces flit in and out, chasing some phantom dream of stability.  \n\nThe city, a sprawling thing of brick and steel, lies just beyond the edge of this ordered world.  A mall, the size of a small town, stands as a monument to consumption, a place where the ghosts of choice wander amongst the aisles.  Fifteen minutes in the car, a journey through sterile landscapes and the hum of engines, and you’re there.  \n\nThis place, it's safe.  Everyone knows everyone, or at least they know the stories.  It's a place where the past whispers in the wind, a place where the future feels like a broken record. It's a place to be comfortable, a place to fade away.",
            "The town sits low, a hollowed-out place wedged between the sprawl and the city's hungry maw. East side, they call it. Where the houses huddle close, weary bones against the wind. A lot of folks here lean hard to keep their heads above water, pockets thin, lives worn. But there's a kind of grit in the air, a stubborn hope that clings to the porch swings and the faded paint.\n\nNeighbors wave, faces creased with the stories of a life lived hard. The street's a thin thread of cracked asphalt, the air thick with the smell of burning leaves and regret.  A few times, the silence has been shattered, the echo of gunfire a hollow drumbeat against the night. Lost a boy, the family next door. Gunfire in the dark, spilled blood on the pavement. They say the devil's got a hold of this town, whispers carried on the wind. Fentanyl, they call it. A slow death, a cold hand reaching in. But there are whispers of hope too. Places where folks try to claw their way back, a fighting chance against the tide.\n\nMy son, he goes to school. A haven in the dust. Good folks there, teachers with tired eyes but a fierce love for the kids. He's got needs, special needs, but they treat him like gold. The school feeds the hungry, clothes the naked, and tries to mend the broken.  The town's got its scars, its wounds. But there's a beauty in the broken places, a resilience that shines through the cracks. It's a town that stays in your bones, a place where you can't help but feel the weight of its history, the ache of its heart. This is home.",
            "The Hill holds her. Buildings claw at the sky, ghosts of a time when things were different. Seven stories high, my own wall stares out across the street at the old theater, its marquee dark and dusty. A block down, the neon glow of the arcade bar spills out onto the sidewalk, drawing a swarm of souls on the warm nights. June and July, the line snakes out the door, a promise of fleeting joy. A few paces up, the park, a concrete island in a sea of brick. Tall steps rise from the ground, a cold stone embrace in winter. Then the men come, huddled in rows, their tents a ragged tapestry against the gray. Not much snow here, but the rain, the rain comes down in torrents, a relentless curtain in the heart of winter.  Closer to the warmth, the city's heart, they make their stand. In the distance, the Family Center, a beacon of some small solace.\n\nThey don't forget, these people. The Hill, once a scar on the West Coast, a name whispered in fear. The stories linger, tales of agents and raids, a war fought in shadows. Three decades gone, but the ghosts remain. They work, these people, cleaning the streets, holding onto what little dignity they have. They say, if you're white, don't walk alone after dark. A warning, a shadow from the past. Or maybe, just maybe, they see something in me. A darkness that blurs the lines. Perhaps they recognize the ache, the constant vigilance, the reminders that plague us all. The fear, the ignorance, the weight of assumptions.\n\nHilltop, it's home. The streets hum at night, a symphony of life and struggle. They offer me warmth, kindness, a shoulder against the cold. Someone keeps a laundromat open, a flicker of light in the darkness. A stranger looks me in the eye, hands me five dollars, whispers, \"You're beautiful, you're valuable.\" And in that moment, I believe it.",
            "The country holds me here. Small town Michigan, where fields give way to towns strung like beads on a faded map. No city sprawls, no chains, no neon glow. Just the long road, the engine's hum, and the dust rising behind. But the land, it holds beauty. Water, on all sides. Lake Michigan, a cold vastness, and Charlevoix, smaller, but no less stark. Beaches everywhere, sun-bleached sand and the whisper of waves.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's the bones of a place, each house a story etched in wood and stone. Not stacked high, but spread out, breathing. Some renewed, some weathered, each with a basement, a darkness below. Aluminum siding, the color of rain, covers many. Houses of every shade, like a forgotten box of crayons, line the streets. Yards, green and unruly, with swings that creak and the ghosts of laughter. Gardens, fences, dogs barking. The scent of cut grass, of woodsmoke in the evening. Hardworking folks, raising families, the lifeblood of the place.\n\nChildren run, their laughter echoing in the quiet. Dogs chase squirrels, old men sit on porches, rocking slowly. A wave, a nod, a shared silence. The lawnmower's drone, the rumble of a passing car. It's not a place of flash or grandeur, but a place where you can feel the earth beneath your feet, where the sun sets slow and the moon rises heavy. Safe. A place to be rooted, to find solace.\n\nThe sheriff's station, a stoic stone sentinel, stands watch. The health department, a quiet presence. The recycling center, a place of quiet industry. Even the airport, a small thing, with its whispers of engines, feels like a part of the rhythm of this place. An ice cream parlor, a few blocks away, where the scent of waffle cones hangs heavy in the air. The park, eight blocks, a place for children to run free.\n\nIt's a place that whispers of belonging, of community. A place, maybe, where you can finally find your way home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city sprawls, a concrete and steel beast. Neighborhoods stitched together in a haphazard quilt, commerce bleeding into residence. Shops and offices pressed tight against each other, a dizzying array of storefront signs bleeding neon into the dusk. Eating places, a constant hum of ovens and sizzling grease, promising quick sustenance. Big chains with their cold, sterile promises, and smaller shops, tucked along the choked streets, whispers of individuality. Parks, green islands in the gray, choked with the laughter of children and the drone of cicadas. \n\nFaces, a kaleidoscope of shades and tongues.  Here a cluster of rainbow flags, there a synagogue, its windows a lattice of prayer. A scattering of souls, displaced, from the cold wastelands of the East. Beyond the immediate sprawl, the city’s heart beats with a thousand nameless rhythms. Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia – pockets of the world nestled against each other, miles swallowed by the city’s endless maw.  Iron horses on steel tracks, choked by exhaust and the weight of a thousand journeys.  Ten miles, a journey into the belly of the beast, a crawl through time. \n\nConcrete canyons rise, new towers reaching for a sky choked with smog.  Promises of easy living, a tide of souls drawn to the city’s siren song. But old wounds fester, the neighborhood’s heart grows heavy with the burden of too many. \n\nHouses, a patchwork of dreams. Some stand alone, sentinels against the encroaching tide. Others huddle together, families seeking solace in shared walls. Even here, in the heart of the city, the human spirit seeks connection. But the streets are long and the shadows deep. Faces pass, strangers in the anonymity of the city. Memories linger, of laughter and shared secrets, a child's world fading in the city's relentless churn.",
            "The houses huddled close, most single-family, some split, two lives breathin' in one skin. My own sits on a patch of lawn, a drive beside it cracked and thirsty. Like the others, it remembers a time when this was the dream, the edges of the country tamed, promise in every picket fence. Now the dream's pullin' away, leavin' a chill in the air. But the houses hold on, whisperin' the old stories, a stubborn echo in the wind. \n\nFolks ain't as bright-eyed as they used to be. Lawns ain't kept like they used to be. But the cars still sit, iron nests in the drives, and the children play, the world their own. The school, a brick sentinel standin' near ninety years, still calls to the young, stirs the ghosts in the old. Churches sit empty, hollow bones against the sky, but the courts echo with the slap of sneakers, the sharp cries of the game.\n\nEach house different, yet the same ache in their bones. The Super \"A\" stands tall, a concrete monolith, run by a family from a land far away, their faces veiled. Black faces fill the streets, generations deep. The children kick a ball, the air thick with dust and hope. The youth remember a time when everyone knew everyone. The karate school, a memory now, replaced by a place where pills promise answers. The movie theater shows old films, a flicker of light in the dusk, favored by the old, who remember a time when stories unfolded on a silver screen.\n\nA ribbon of road slices through the town, but the on and off ramps lie beyond, in another's domain. There was talk of a change, a new path, a way to ease the flow. The young yearned for it, the old resisted, their grip on the past a thorny vine. Now a new school rises, a monument to the future, and the town debates its spirit, its soul. A cyborg, they say, with a drawl and a log cabin, a strange reflection of a world caught between the old and the new.",
            "You might pass it over, this place. Just another row of houses behind the bony ribs of a dead shopping center. Not the kind of place you'd think to find  dwellings, not the kind folks yearn for. But if you cut through the rust and the weeds behind the husk of that old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty most of the year, filled only with ghosts of summer reunions, you'd find it. A whole world tucked in behind the shadows. \n\nApartment blocks huddled there, like nesting dolls unmade and laid out in a row. Each one a secret chamber. The first ones you'd see, they'd be the ones the news boys had chewed on, scandal and whispers clinging to their walls. But turn your back on those, and the ones next door, the ones after that, they hold a different kind of story.  \n\nAcross the road, a college satellite campus, a whisper of learning against the sunbaked asphalt. Students trailing in, coffee cups in hand, yawning like the world hadn't quite woken up yet. The iron gates groan open, letting them in one by one, while commuters curse them, shaking their fists, impatient for the road to be theirs again. \n\nThe road runs into another street, lined with houses and a park. On one side the park, children whirling in the sun, a blur of legs and laughter. On the other, a place for mending broken bones, a haven for the injured. Cheerful furniture spills out onto the porch, a ceiling fan sighing in the humid air, pushing the heat back and forth like a restless spirit. \n\nA sushi place hums beside the park, cheap eats and the quiet clinking of chopsticks. A swimming supply store, a nail salon, all nestled together in the strip mall. A frozen yogurt place, the kind where kids pile on the toppings, their cups sweating in the sun, their laughter as bright and sharp as broken glass.\n\nThis place, it's a picture postcard, faded and cracked, a glimpse of a time that's gone and come back around again. The south, slow and sweet, where the days stretch long and nothing ever truly changes, not even time itself.",
            "\"Where's everything?\" she asked, the car rumbling past fields of corn that stretched to the horizon. An endless sea of green, she'd never seen such a thing. This close to the earth, it was a different life altogether.  \"This is it,\" I said, knowing the emptiness would take her aback. She'd grown up where the grocery store was a stone's throw from your door. Open space wasn't in her blood. \n\nI told her about growing up in the Ohio dust, the endless fields, the way the wind could whip across the land and steal your breath. In that moment, she saw a part of me she hadn't known was there.\n\nDown a two-lane road, past a quarry filled with the still water of a forgotten lake, the houses huddled together like sheep. Brick and stucco, each with a half acre of land, a patch of green to call their own. Come spring, the flowers would burst forth, a riot of color against the backdrop of the changing seasons. Driveways would fill with high-gloss Mercedes, gleaming like beetles in the midday sun after a bath.\n\nMy neighbor, a Korean man, would be out there, his John Deere mower humming a lonely tune. He'd been a doctor once, they said, but now he tended his lawn with the devotion of a priest tending to his altar. He'd sing a little, sometimes, his voice thin and reedy, but always kind. They all laughed at him, but he didn't seem to mind. He was a good man, a quiet man, with stories etched into his face.\n\nPast his house, mine stood, grey stucco against the endless blue. Geese honked from the side yard, our terrier snapping at their heels. Behind the house, a stream ran clear and cold, feeding the quarry. Bullfrogs croaked, and the low moo of a distant cow filled the air. A handmade wooden bridge led to an oasis, untouched and wild, a tangle of trees and wildflowers. That's where I spent my days, building forts, chasing rabbits, dreaming.\n\nWinter came hard, a cold fist clenching around the land. The green turned brown, the trees bare skeletons against the grey sky. But the snow, when it came, was a blessing. A blanket of white, covering the world in silence. Snow angels lay in the yard, snowmen stood guard. My sister and I, we'd wage war in the snow, building forts of packed snow, our weapons snowballs hard as rocks. We were kings and queens of our own little kingdom, unaware of the world beyond our winter wonderland.",
            "You come to Portland, Oregon, you gotta understand something 'bout weird. It ain't just a word, it's a way of life.  See that sign on the side of that building, the one that serves up pizza by day and god knows what by night? \"Keep Portland Weird\" it says. Some reckon it's a whisper from the past, a ghost of the 90s, a time when this town was tucked away, cheaper and quieter, breeding its own strange breeds. Others, they hear it as a siren song, a call to come find acceptance, a place where different ain't a dirty word, it's a badge of honor.  \n\nBut the Californians keep pouring in, their money and their condos changing the landscape. Still, weird persists. It ain't about wallowing in some kind of radical acceptance, no sir. It's about finding a space for things that don't fit, things that make others squint and turn away. Like the rest of these United States, we buy our trinkets from the same distant shores.  We get our yoga, our hipsters, our suits and ties. Maybe weird just means we look at it all a little sideways.  \n\nTake my neighborhood, for instance.  You got houses painted in colors that'd make a fool blush, gardens bursting with flowers and herbs and things you can eat lining the sidewalks. And in the summer, the free boxes appear. Cardboard boxes, plastic bags, anything goes.  They hold the detritus of someone's life, cast off, abandoned. But inside, there's magic. A dress, a book, a tool, something unexpected, something meant for you. It ain't necessarily a treasure, but it's a possibility. That's Portland, ain't it? A place where the everyday holds a touch of the strange. \n\nThere's goat yoga, that's a thing here.  And soccer.  You got those who chase dreams, and those who chase the bottom of a bottle. We got our problems, sure.  Drugs, homelessness, the same old ghosts haunting every American town.  But even in the rain and the grey, there's a strange kind of beauty, a resilience. We're not so different, you and me, from the rest of them. We just wear our weirdness a little more proudly.",
            "The mountains. They were always there. Northward, sentinels against the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawns and dusks. A silent witness to it all.  Even when the mind went numb, consumed by the grind of things, they were there. Steady. Unmoved.  Unflinching.  And on those days when the weight of the world pressed down, when the soul felt frayed, they called to him.  A beckoning. A promise of solace.  He turned then, and in their presence, found a measure of peace. A strength to carry on. One day at a time.\n\nHe'd come here for college, drawn in by the mountains that clawed at the sky north of the campus. The university itself, with its halls and gardens, held a certain beauty, a kind of order. But the mountains, they held the throne. The town, in its own way, was a thing of grace. Cafés, stained with the ghosts of all-nighters fuelled by caffeine and ambition.  A short walk, a rumble of the bus, and the downtown hummed with a different kind of life.  Brick buildings, faded and worn, whispering of a past long gone.  Old stories etched in mortar. And then, a few streets on, the quiet of the suburbs returned. A library, a haven in a world of noise. This dance between the old and the new, the bustling and the still, it gave the place a strange kind of magic.\n\nMemories were made here, sharp and bright as shattered glass.  Laughter echoing through the park, the rusted swings creaking a mournful tune.  The rush of the city, a desperate sprint to catch a glimpse of the silver screen.  But there were shadows too, cast long and cold.  The ponds, still and reflecting, held their own sorrows. Tears shed in the dead of night, lost in the vastness of the world.  He watched the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each playing their part in the grand scheme.  And he wondered, for the hundredth time, about his own place in it all.\n\nHe walked, past the willow trees, past the houses that huddled together like frightened children.  He walked until the sun, a molten fist, broke over the horizon.  And then, he saw them. The mountains.  Staring down, unyielding, a silent testament to the passage of time. And in that moment, something stirred within him. A spark of defiance. A will to endure.",
            "The roads in Bensonhurst cling to the city like moss to stone. Finding it ain't hard.  The iron horse runs through it, spitting out souls from the belly of the beast. It's a place where concrete meets the sky, a symphony of car horns and the rumble of the subway.  Everywhere you turn, the scent of a thousand kitchens, the rattle of a thousand languages.  \n\nThe shops, they're like sentinels, mostly Asian faces behind the counters. You'll see them every block, a tapestry of bright signs promising cheap rice and spices. Markets overflowing with vegetables, laundromats churning like the river. Locals swear by them, say the food is good, the prices fair.  \n\nBut Bensonhurst ain't just a mosaic of faces. It's a crucible, where generations clash and mingle.  A kid born to Korean parents spitting out curses in Brooklynese.  A grandparent, eyes clouded with the ghosts of a homeland lost, pushing a stroller down the sidewalk.\n\nThere's a park, recently patched up, a sliver of green in the sea of grey.  A dozen basketball courts, a field where the ghosts of Little League dreams still linger.  Kids screaming, fathers arguing, the air thick with the smell of damp earth and sweat.  \n\nNo towering office blocks here, just rows of houses, two families crammed into each, the walls thin as paper.  And the noise, God, the noise.  Cars roaring down the streets, engines spitting fire, radios blasting the latest sins.  \n\nAt night, the shadows lengthen.  The streets are slick with a kind of uneasy peace.  You hold your breath, watch your back.  The city's darkness has a way of bringing out the worst in folks.  \n\nPickpockets, bullies, the occasional flash of violence.  I've seen it all. Heard the screams.  Even felt the sting of a fist.  But Bensonhurst ain't all bad.  It's a place where you learn to survive, to fight for every inch of ground.  It's a place where you come face to face with the raw, unfiltered heart of the city.",
            "The street runs slantwise down to the water, a crooked ribbon of cracked and crumbling asphalt.  Few sidewalks grace these parts, the sidewalkless road swallowed by the steep grade. They call it the \"work out hill,\" a kind of cruel joke for the runners who hammer their way up its face each day.  The houses cling to the shoulder of the slope, proud structures stacked high with glass eyes that stare out at the bay.  Always the bay. Always the hunger for the water.  The trees, those green sentinels, are an enemy here.  They must be cut back, pruned, trimmed, to give way to the endless vista.  The wires strung above, telephone and power, hang in tattered strands, their patchwork repairs testament to the storms that roll in from the sea.  Rain and wind, they come together in a ceaseless assault, stripping the bark from the trees, snapping branches, bringing down the lines.\n\nMoss, a green velvet, covers everything.  It creeps across roofs and cars, clings to the rusted railing of porch steps.  My car, left unattended in the driveway for a month, sprouted a thick coat of it, green and furry. Took hours to scrub it clean.\n\nChildren are scarce, but the schoolhouse stands sentinel a few blocks down. Mostly old folk live here, their days spent watching the tides and tending to their dogs.  Those dogs, they roam free, a pack of restless spirits, racing each other down the hill, noses twitching, tails wagging.  A loose window, an open door, and they'll be inside, their wet noses nudging your hand, their eyes pleading for a scratch.  Rabbits are feral here, a war waged between gardeners and hunters. My cats, sleek and nimble, have driven them from our yard.  Birds flit through the trees, sparrows and hummingbirds, a hawk or eagle occasionally soaring overhead until the crows, defenders of the sky, drive it away.\n\nDown by the water, a scattering of restaurants offer fresh catches from the bay, their tables spilling out onto the weathered docks.  No wide beach here, just rocky shores.  The bay, narrow and gray, offers a view of the distant shore, the outline hazy through the perpetual mist.",
            "The house sits at the corner, a front porch sentinel overlooking the thoroughfare. A ribbon of asphalt, choked by oaks and pines, connecting two blacktop arteries that bled through the town. Traffic, a steady murmur, a relentless current. Not a bad place, though. A quiet kind of livin'. Faces you see daily, the same weathered hands tending gardens, the same kids on bikes, the same dogs with stumpy legs and mournful eyes. Faces you know like the lines on your own palm. We work from the house. Me, the wife, the daughters, eleven and fourteen, shadows flitting in and out. We're part of the fabric here, the hum.\n\nWinter brings a brief respite from the heat, a dusting of snow that melts quick, leaving the children to slide down the hill that runs beside our street. We watch them from the porch, the smoke from our fire pit curling like ghosts against the leaden sky. Sometimes, a stranger's car, a foreign mark on the asphalt, rouses our curiosity.\n\nThe smell of grilling hangs heavy on the air sometimes, a reminder of summer nights and the slow, sweet rot of fallen leaves. Fall comes, a slow burn of gold and crimson, leaves crackling underfoot, a brittle whisper against the wind.\n\nThe garage, a sanctuary at the back of the house, a place of tools and work. When the doors rise, it feels like the neighborhood breathes in. On holidays, the air thickens with the murmur of voices, the slam of car doors. A brief intrusion, then, silence again.\n\nIt's a good place, quiet, familiar. A place where time moves slow, where the sun paints the trees in shades of rust and gold. A place where you can feel the pulse of the earth beneath your feet.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust. That's all that is. Brown. A tapestry of brown. The lawns, the few that dare to exist, are islands of green, monuments to a kind of desperate hope. Back in the nineties, the houses spread thin, like bones in the sand. Now they're closer, huddled together. This place, it's turning into something else. More like a city. \n\nPeople here, mostly good. Friendly. But like any place, there's a darkness, a shadow in the corners. The old folks around here, they're the kindest. Maybe that's why it feels safe. \n\nStores are chains. Food for Less, Smart & Final. The kind of places that sell cheap comfort.  You want something else, something better, you gotta drive.  Whole Foods, those things, they don't exist here.\n\nConstruction. That's the work. The dust in the air, the clang of hammers, the scrape of metal. This place is still young, still growing. It scares me, this spreading, this taking.  I left the city once. Not going back.\n\nMy hands, they know the feel of drywall, the bite of T-bars.  That's my trade.  \n\nThere's a beauty here, a starkness, a kind of quiet violence. Animals, they live here too. Lizards, bugs, things that scurry in the shadows. My kids, they love them. They chase them, study them.\n\nThe desert, it has its things.  Fairs, museums, mountains that wear white in the winter.  They call it Victorville. A place to see, a place to forget.  But it's a place that gets under your skin.",
            "The neighborhood.  A word that holds a weight different for some.  Folks talkin' 'bout their brick and mortar, their picket fences, their lawns mowed to a razor's edge.  Me, I reckon my neighborhood's different.  Walls ain't brick, but concrete and steel.  Fences, there are none.  The houses, they're dormitories, stacked high, holdin' a hundred souls each.  And the people, well, they're a motley crew.  Fresh faces, eyes wide with somethin' akin to hope, maybe fear.  Older ones, weathered by semesters past, carryin' the weight of knowledge like a burden.\n\nThere are three kinds of shelter in this place.  Apartments, cramped quarters for a handful, four or five souls to a room.  Then the houses, scattered like lonely sentinels, holdin' the alumni, them who've seen the world outside these walls.  And the dormitories, vast, echoing halls, where dreams are made and broken.  \n\nThe stores, they're a lifeline.  Grinding down burgers, slinging coffee, sellin' textbooks and T-shirts with the school's name emblazoned across them like a badge of honor.  And the park, a patch of green amidst the gray, a place for weary souls to find a moment's peace.\n\nThis neighborhood, it ain't like any other.  It's a crucible, forgin' lives, shapin' destinies.  It's a world unto itself, a microcosm of the world beyond.  And I, I'm just a small part of it.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  The dust settled different here in Stockbridge than it did back in Riverdale. It choked the air with a kind of sorrow I couldn't outrun.  Tears came easy then, for the ghosts of friends and laughter left behind. My folks, they talked of opportunity, of a better life for us, a life beyond the shadows.  They said Stockbridge would be good for us, a place to build a future. A place to be something more.\n\nThere was Mr. Glen and his children next door, always a flicker of light in the fading day. And Dennis, for a while, he was a fleeting warmth.  They became family, a thread of kinship in this strange new land.  I remember Mr. Glen's wedding, the sun sinking low over the horizon, the dust rising with each joyous footstep.  His bride, Ms. Veda, shed her white strap, a fragile thing that caught in my hand.  I didn't catch the flowers, but the memory lingers, a bittersweet bloom.\n\nThe neighborhood itself is a labyrinth, winding streets and hidden corners.  I used to navigate it blind, but now I have a guide, a metal box that whispers the way.  Kason and Curtis, they're my anchors here, the only constant in this shifting world.  We played games, chased shadows, sought solace in the flickering light of screens.  Sometimes, I'd wander to the park, where the wind whispered through the leaves and the air tasted of earth and silence.  There, I'd find a measure of peace, a quiet understanding.  I'd practice with my bokken, feel the weight of it in my hand, a promise of strength.\n\nThe basketball court stands silent, the net hanging limp. The tennis court, too, waits for the echo of bouncing balls, the clash of rackets.  My father, he taught me the game, the grace and fury of it all.  Mr. Graves, a gruff but kind man, he molded us, shaped us with sweat and discipline.\n\nThere are stories here, etched in the dust and whispers of the wind.  Stories of laughter and loss, of joy and sorrow.  These are the things that have marked my time here, the things that have made this place a part of me.\n\nBut the best is yet to come. The sun still rises, painting the sky with hope. And I, I am ready to greet it.",
            "The college sits close enough to walk, a fact that holds a certain comfort. The neighborhood, mostly blocks of brick and concrete, holds a few flickering lights of bars and eateries, places where the young and the worn gather, the cost of entry not unreasonable. One such place changed hands recently, its prices climbing, but the liquor flowed and the stories lingered. The faces here are mostly college boys and girls, or men and women worn thin by circumstance, drawn to the low rents. Children run barefoot in the streets, the sound of their laughter echoing off the faded walls, their haven a schoolhouse within shouting distance.\n\nI keep to myself, a solitary figure amidst the murmur of life. The people here, they smoke their weeds, a constant haze hanging in the air. The building manager, in his wisdom, installed an air freshener across from their door, a feeble attempt to mask the scent. A grim joke, a silent indictment.\n\nThe buildings themselves are old, their bones showing through the patched-up skin. Newer ones stand further down the street, gleaming faces with hollow insides. Cheaply built, they stand as monuments to greed, their rents a testament to the desperation of youth. A few blocks over, a greasy spoon serves its fare on paper plates, the aroma of microwaved mystery clinging to the air. Across the street, a gas station, a place of weary souls and broken promises.\n\nBut the city, in its infinite benevolence, redid the road last summer. A broad sidewalk now snakes through the neighborhood, lined with grass and trimmed trees. It's a poor attempt to mask the ugliness, but a gesture nonetheless.\n\nMy apartment building, it stands shrouded in trees, a few stumps marking the sacrifice of some fallen giants. The road behind it, 43rd Street, is a different beast altogether. The sidewalks are cracked and crumbling, the buildings lean and desperate. Trees cling to the edges, trying to hide the rot beneath. \n\nThe crime, it whispers in the shadows, a constant threat. Not confined to one place, it spreads like a disease, infecting the vulnerable.\nBut I make my home here. The rent is low, and the necessities are at hand. The college, a beacon of hope, sits within walking distance. Two bus stops offer a gateway to the wider world. I exist here, a small note in the symphony of the city, a fleeting breath in the face of the endless night.",
            "The houses here, they squat low, twins on a muted curve. Not crowded, not lonely. Yellow paint, white porches, roofs like rusted tin. Most folks know each other. We gather at dusk, at the end of driveways that lead nowhere in particular. Small voices chatter, children chasing dust devils and ghosts in the fading light. A breath of stillness in this world of clockwork and cold steel. Like stepping back, maybe.\n\nFields stretch out, emerald and gold, under skies the color of a summer sky. Clouds, like cotton blown loose, drift by. But there's a shadow over this peace. The wind whispers warnings of things unseen, of teeth tearing at the world. Last night, the sirens screamed, a chorus of steel and fear. I found myself in the tub, my smallest dog pressed against my chest, my purse and a few pillows for company. The big one wouldn't budge, whimpering, pacing the living room. Out there, the sky cracked open with hail, fat and angry, drumming on the roof. After the storm, the air hung thick, the ground steaming like a wound. Heat and cold, a sudden, brutal dance. Then, a light, a rupture in the grey. A double rainbow arched across the sky, a fragile promise. I grabbed my phone, the screen catching the light, and snapped pictures, trying to hold the beauty before it faded. \n\nThe world settled, quiet again, save for the chirping of crickets. Then, slow, the neighborhood stirred. Doors opened, children ran, laughter spilled out. Back to the rhythm of things. Mom's stirring pots, children chasing fireflies.\n\nThis place, it's a haven. Forty minutes from the city, but a world away. The folks here, they speak slow, their words like honey. Two rooms, two baths, that's all we need. But inside, each house is a story waiting to be told.\n\nI walk out back, past the fields, to the pond, still and silent. Deer graze in the shadows, and the bullfrog's song, a deep rumble, fills the morning air. A rooster crows, a lonely sound in the vastness. A donkey brays, somewhere in the distance. A small community, a piece of the old world. I found my peace here.",
            "The house stood empty when I came. Eighth grade. A year of shadows. Made friends slow, like roots burrowing deep. Two boys, down the street, a house two over. They're gone now, but the ghosts of their laughter still linger in the porch swing. The old folks, they're still here, faces etched with the stories of the years. \n\nSame houses, two stories reaching for a sky that never seems to change. Kids on the street, their voices a symphony of summer days. Mostly quiet, this place. You're left alone unless you need something. Packages sit safe on the stoop, untouched. Trust hangs in the air, thin but real.\n\nThere's a park, a stone's throw away. Memories live there too, etched on the worn swings and cracked asphalt. Ball games, laughter, the sting of a well-aimed elbow to the nose. Football days, the sun a furnace in the sky. Now, it's the young ones, my cousin's brood, their faces lit with the joy of slides and swings. Their laughter, a echo of a past life. The park, a well of quiet longing.\n\nFood smells drift on the wind. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian. A world in a mile's radius. But the world has changed. Now, food arrives at the doorstep, a Ghostly offering from apps and screens. Fast food reigns, a familiar comfort. Pizza, a solace for the weary soul. The stores, they have everything. Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store with aisles that stretch to eternity. Even a shop, Indian-owned, smelling of spices and home.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a haven. A place where the light is still warm, where the air carries the scent of home. Reading the news, seeing the darkness in other places, makes me grateful for this quiet corner of the world. A place where neighbors are more than just faces on a street.",
            "The town sits small, nestled in the Carolina heat. A peach town, they call it, the world's peach capital they say, though that sign hanging crooked at the edge of town don't mean much to the wind.  Fields crawl out from the houses, one neat row of trees or another, cattle grazing under the sun.  Houses stand back from the road, two stories high, metal roofs glinting like scars against the blue, or gray shingles worn thin by years. Few of them face the dust, most turned inward. \n\nA lone light hangs over the crossroads, a single eye blinking in the stillness. Three places to eat, maybe four if you count the Chinese place. Hong Kong, they call it, run by a family silent as the graves. Fiesta, bright enough to burn your eyes, and Gary's, where the burgers are flat and the grease hangs heavy. The pizza place closed down, leaving a hollow space in the air. \n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, a name worn thin with time. They sell cherry Coke, sweet and dark, like the secrets the town keeps. The IGA, a little store with a big name, crammed full of things you need and things you don't.  Folks go there for a carton of milk, a loaf of bread, but the real shopping's done in Batesburg-Leesville, down the road. Dollar General, though, that's where the heart of the town beats. Crowded and humming, a place where you can find anything and everything. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, built solid as the earth. A kind woman runs it, knows everyone's name, knows their stories. Clark's Cuts and Kennels sits attached, a place for dogs to be groomed and loved.  The doctor's office and the vet, both small, tucked away like secrets.  A single schoolhouse, teaching children the alphabet and the ways of the world. \n\nNo parks, no laughter in the streets, just the quiet rustle of leaves and the low hum of cicadas. They're building a place for kids to play, a patch of green in the dusty landscape. But still, it's a town that sleeps, a place where time slows down and secrets breed like rabbits.  You could drive right through without knowing it, a blink and you'd miss it.",
            "The first time the name of this place drifted into my ears, it was on some vanished voices podcast. A tale of disappearances. Strange thing, considering the rent here. A thousand a month, easy. Never heard a whisper of it, not from any of the boys I knew. Maybe it's the struggle. Some nights I see them, eyes red-rimmed, hollowed out, weeping. The cost of living, a heavy stone in the gut. But we've learned to mend with scraps. The scent of moth-eaten things, the dusty charm of flea market finds. You learn to smell less, in time. Or maybe the smoke gets you. Whatever the case, the flea market, it always calls. The smell of adulthood, a musty echo of time. Dusty magazines piled on a silent piano. It sinks into the leather, a stain that won't wash out. Here, three thrift shops within walking distance. Start at the edge and you can tick off two charities, a library, a bookstore old as sin, and a curio shop crammed full of whispers. Downtown, a river of iron and flesh, choked with cars and people every morning. But the silence in those shops, it's a shroud. No matter the traffic, the din, the silence holds. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more of them, the cars and the people. They call it development, I guess. A city growing its bones, hosting the titans of online commerce. Still, the pangs of progress, they show. Like New York, I reckon. Everyone with their own face set, their own path. No one asking much of you. You can be a ghost, quiet and alone, and no one bats an eye. Not like the South, where a sigh means you care. Here, they keep their lives shut tight. You can wear your mask as long as you like, and the city will roll on, waves against the shore. A lively place, though. Between the pianist next door and the two souls upstairs, always a melody hanging in the air. We ain't strangers here, not quite. We gather for needs, for birthdays, for funerals, for each other when the going gets rough. Lucky, I reckon. Most of the neighbors, decent folks. Treat me right, I return the favor. Food left on the stoop, mail delivered, a hand extended. A smile, a nod. Makes a man feel less alone in this concrete jungle.",
            "The place I call home, it sprawls out like a grid of sameness.  Rows of houses, each a mirror image of the next, all singing the same song of conformity.  The Homeowners' Association, a silent shepherd, dictates the tune.  Every yard a uniform stage set: a patch of manicured green, pebbles scattered like glacial drift, and driveways short enough for the soul to tire before the car.  The occasional tree, stunted and pruned, stands witness.  Two-car garages, all identical, line the streets.  Concrete, newly laid and smooth as a preacher's promise, stretches on, a testament to order.  Families come and go, but the roads remain unblemished, free of the scars of time and broken dreams.\n\nMost houses, one story, rooted in the earth.  Some reach for the sky, two stories tall, like prayers unanswered.  Mailboxes, not the lonely sentinels you'd expect, but a huddled cluster at the end of the lane, guarded and uniform.  Keys turn, metal groans, and the secrets of daily life are retrieved.  Lockers stand sentinel for packages, their metal hearts cold and uncaring.  The HOA, its hand in every detail, its grip tight.\n\nMy house sits on the edge of the city, a place where the urban bleeds into the wild.  We have land here, plenty of it.  Pools, fenced and shimmering, offer a taste of paradise.  Trails wind through the green, paths for those who seek solace in the rustling leaves and the murmur of the wind.  Exercise, not a chore, but a rite of passage in this land of open spaces.\n\nThe people here, mostly old, their faces etched with the stories of lives lived.  Their eyes hold a quiet wisdom, a knowingness born of years.  There are a few younger faces, these newcomers, lost in the labyrinth of ambition.  But all are connected, bound by the invisible threads of this small town, a place where strangers become neighbors, and neighbors become family.\n\nThe city, though vast, whispers of a time gone by.  A single mall, a monolith of commerce, stands as a testament to our needs and desires.  Fifteen minutes, a blink in the grand scheme of things, and the world opens up, a kaleidoscope of choices.  From the purveyors of organic greens to the masters of discounted dreams, there's a place for every soul. \n\nThis is my home.  Safe, predictable, and yet, somehow, still yearning for something more.",
            "The town sits low, a bruise on the flank of the city.  East side. That's where I dwell.  Houses huddle close, weathered wood and chipped paint.  Folks here, they scrape by. Renters and owners, all with eyes that have seen hard times.  But there's a kind of quiet grace in their faces.  A nod on the street, a word shared, the air thick with understanding.  \n\nCrime, it crawls like a weed in the cracks.  A few shots in the night, a life pinched out too soon.  Lost a boy next door, they did.  Taken by a bullet outside some darkened bar.  The echoes still linger.  We've had things go missing, a coat left on the porch, a bike left unlocked.  Just the way of things here.\n\nThe sickness, that's the real shadow.  The white powder, a whisper on the wind, taking hold, stealing breath.  They say it's everywhere, this curse.  But here, there are hands reaching out, trying to pull folks back from the edge.  Places to mend, to find a foothold.  A flicker of hope.\n\nBut the school, it's a haven.  Teachers with hearts as big as the sky, guiding young minds.  My son, he struggles, but they see him, they hold him up.  No scorn, no whispers.  Just kindness, a steady hand.  The PTO, they work hard, keeping the spirit alive, bringing families together.  Free meals for every child, so no empty stomachs at the table.  They understand, they care.\n\nThe town itself, it's a patchwork.  New roads, blooming flowers, parks freshly painted, all on the west side, where the money flows.  But here, on the east side, the cracks show deeper.  A feeling of being forgotten.\n\nStill, I love it here.  The quiet strength, the shared burdens, the hard-won beauty.  This town, it's in my blood now.  We've made it our own.  And even though there's darkness, there's also light.  A stubborn, enduring light.",
            "The Hill holds its breath against the city. Seven stories above, I look out at the old theater, brick and shadow, a relic of what was. Down the slope, a flicker of neon betrays the arcade bar, a den of laughter and hushed whispers on summer nights. The line spills out, a river of faces seeking solace in the dark. A few blocks on, the park rises, walled in concrete, steps leading up like broken teeth. Winter comes, a grey shroud, and the men and women take shelter, tents in neat rows along the sidewalk, huddled against the city's bones. They share the scant warmth, closer to the family center, a flicker of hope in the cold, where they might find a moment's peace. \n\nThe Hill wasn't always this way. Stories linger, whispers in the wind, of the days when shadows danced with violence, of the men in suits, the badges gleaming, sweeping through the streets like a storm. They say the ghosts of those days still walk among us, etched into the faces of the people who call it home. They work hard, these people, their hands calloused, their hearts weary. They tend to their streets, fight for a sliver of light in the darkness. They warn the newcomers, the pale faces who wander in at night, \"Don't walk alone after dark.\"  A shadow of the old fears, a whisper of the past.\n\nMaybe it's the way the light catches my skin, maybe it's the way I walk, blending into the shadows. But the Hill sees something in me, a kindred spirit. It sees the scars, the reminders that we are all searching for something, something more than this, something better. It sees the fight, the struggle, the yearning for a world where the only shadows are those cast by the setting sun. \n\nI walk these streets, feeling the pulse of the city beneath my feet. I see kindness in the lines on their faces, hear it in their voices, feel it in the warmth of a shared smile. This is my home, this rough, beautiful place. This is where I belong.",
            "The land here stretches flat as a dead man's hand. Farmland gives way to towns that cater to the summer crowd, the kind with boat keys jingling in their pockets and flip-flops slapping on the pavement. No towering steel and glass here, no chains with names like Applebee's or Target.  You want something, you gotta drive for it.  But there's beauty in the vastness.  Two Great Lakes hug this place, Michigan's dark water on one side, Charlevoix's turquoise mirror on the other.  Every turn offers a dip in the sand, a taste of the cool current.  \n\nThe houses are scattered, not crammed like teeth in a mouthful.  They're old bones, some patched and freshened, others with the patina of time worn into their skin.  Siding the color of tarnished silver, a faded testament to summers past.  Every shade imaginable, like a child's box of crayons spilled across the street.  Yards, choked with weeds maybe, or manicured tight, each telling a story.  Kids on swings, dogs chasing squirrels, gardens bursting with life. This is the heart of it, the backbone of the country.  Hard-working folks, raising families, the rhythm of life pulsing slow and steady.\n\nYou'll see the sheriff's station, solid and squat, like a watchful dog.  The jail next door, a reminder that darkness lurks even in the quietest corners. The health department, too, a beacon of order in the chaos.  Down the road, the recycling center, where the refuse of life is reborn. And the baseball field, where the crack of the bat echoes through the dusk.  The airport, a tiny speck on the horizon, spitting out dreams on wings of steel.\n\nThis is a place you don't come to for the spectacle.  It's a place to settle, to put down roots.  A place where the air is clean and the stars are bright.  It's a place where you can raise your children, knowing they'll grow strong and true.  It's a place where you can finally rest."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city sprawls, a concrete and steel beast. Neighborhoods stitched together in a haphazard quilt, commerce bleeding into residence. Shops and offices pressed tight against each other, a dizzying array of storefront signs bleeding neon into the dusk. Eating places, a constant hum of ovens and sizzling grease, promising quick sustenance. Big chains with their cold, sterile promises, and smaller shops, tucked along the choked streets, whispers of individuality. Parks, green islands in the gray, choked with the laughter of children and the drone of cicadas. \n\nFaces, a kaleidoscope of shades and tongues.  Here a cluster of rainbow flags, there a synagogue, its windows a lattice of prayer. A scattering of souls, displaced, from the cold wastelands of the East. Beyond the immediate sprawl, the city’s heart beats with a thousand nameless rhythms. Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia – pockets of the world nestled against each other, miles swallowed by the city’s endless maw.  Iron horses on steel tracks, choked by exhaust and the weight of a thousand journeys.  Ten miles, a journey into the belly of the beast, a crawl through time. \n\nConcrete canyons rise, new towers reaching for a sky choked with smog.  Promises of easy living, a tide of souls drawn to the city’s siren song. But old wounds fester, the neighborhood’s heart grows heavy with the burden of too many. \n\nHouses, a patchwork of dreams. Some stand alone, sentinels against the encroaching tide. Others huddle together, families seeking solace in shared walls. Even here, in the heart of the city, the human spirit seeks connection. But the streets are long and the shadows deep. Faces pass, strangers in the anonymity of the city. Memories linger, of laughter and shared secrets, a child's world fading in the city's relentless churn.",
            "The houses huddled close, most single-family, some split, two lives breathin' in one skin. My own sits on a patch of lawn, a drive beside it cracked and thirsty. Like the others, it remembers a time when this was the dream, the edges of the country tamed, promise in every picket fence. Now the dream's pullin' away, leavin' a chill in the air. But the houses hold on, whisperin' the old stories, a stubborn echo in the wind. \n\nFolks ain't as bright-eyed as they used to be. Lawns ain't kept like they used to be. But the cars still sit, iron nests in the drives, and the children play, the world their own. The school, a brick sentinel standin' near ninety years, still calls to the young, stirs the ghosts in the old. Churches sit empty, hollow bones against the sky, but the courts echo with the slap of sneakers, the sharp cries of the game.\n\nEach house different, yet the same ache in their bones. The Super \"A\" stands tall, a concrete monolith, run by a family from a land far away, their faces veiled. Black faces fill the streets, generations deep. The children kick a ball, the air thick with dust and hope. The youth remember a time when everyone knew everyone. The karate school, a memory now, replaced by a place where pills promise answers. The movie theater shows old films, a flicker of light in the dusk, favored by the old, who remember a time when stories unfolded on a silver screen.\n\nA ribbon of road slices through the town, but the on and off ramps lie beyond, in another's domain. There was talk of a change, a new path, a way to ease the flow. The young yearned for it, the old resisted, their grip on the past a thorny vine. Now a new school rises, a monument to the future, and the town debates its spirit, its soul. A cyborg, they say, with a drawl and a log cabin, a strange reflection of a world caught between the old and the new.",
            "You might pass it over, this place. Just another row of houses behind the bony ribs of a dead shopping center. Not the kind of place you'd think to find  dwellings, not the kind folks yearn for. But if you cut through the rust and the weeds behind the husk of that old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty most of the year, filled only with ghosts of summer reunions, you'd find it. A whole world tucked in behind the shadows. \n\nApartment blocks huddled there, like nesting dolls unmade and laid out in a row. Each one a secret chamber. The first ones you'd see, they'd be the ones the news boys had chewed on, scandal and whispers clinging to their walls. But turn your back on those, and the ones next door, the ones after that, they hold a different kind of story.  \n\nAcross the road, a college satellite campus, a whisper of learning against the sunbaked asphalt. Students trailing in, coffee cups in hand, yawning like the world hadn't quite woken up yet. The iron gates groan open, letting them in one by one, while commuters curse them, shaking their fists, impatient for the road to be theirs again. \n\nThe road runs into another street, lined with houses and a park. On one side the park, children whirling in the sun, a blur of legs and laughter. On the other, a place for mending broken bones, a haven for the injured. Cheerful furniture spills out onto the porch, a ceiling fan sighing in the humid air, pushing the heat back and forth like a restless spirit. \n\nA sushi place hums beside the park, cheap eats and the quiet clinking of chopsticks. A swimming supply store, a nail salon, all nestled together in the strip mall. A frozen yogurt place, the kind where kids pile on the toppings, their cups sweating in the sun, their laughter as bright and sharp as broken glass.\n\nThis place, it's a picture postcard, faded and cracked, a glimpse of a time that's gone and come back around again. The south, slow and sweet, where the days stretch long and nothing ever truly changes, not even time itself.",
            "\"Where's everything?\" she asked, the car rumbling past fields of corn that stretched to the horizon. An endless sea of green, she'd never seen such a thing. This close to the earth, it was a different life altogether.  \"This is it,\" I said, knowing the emptiness would take her aback. She'd grown up where the grocery store was a stone's throw from your door. Open space wasn't in her blood. \n\nI told her about growing up in the Ohio dust, the endless fields, the way the wind could whip across the land and steal your breath. In that moment, she saw a part of me she hadn't known was there.\n\nDown a two-lane road, past a quarry filled with the still water of a forgotten lake, the houses huddled together like sheep. Brick and stucco, each with a half acre of land, a patch of green to call their own. Come spring, the flowers would burst forth, a riot of color against the backdrop of the changing seasons. Driveways would fill with high-gloss Mercedes, gleaming like beetles in the midday sun after a bath.\n\nMy neighbor, a Korean man, would be out there, his John Deere mower humming a lonely tune. He'd been a doctor once, they said, but now he tended his lawn with the devotion of a priest tending to his altar. He'd sing a little, sometimes, his voice thin and reedy, but always kind. They all laughed at him, but he didn't seem to mind. He was a good man, a quiet man, with stories etched into his face.\n\nPast his house, mine stood, grey stucco against the endless blue. Geese honked from the side yard, our terrier snapping at their heels. Behind the house, a stream ran clear and cold, feeding the quarry. Bullfrogs croaked, and the low moo of a distant cow filled the air. A handmade wooden bridge led to an oasis, untouched and wild, a tangle of trees and wildflowers. That's where I spent my days, building forts, chasing rabbits, dreaming.\n\nWinter came hard, a cold fist clenching around the land. The green turned brown, the trees bare skeletons against the grey sky. But the snow, when it came, was a blessing. A blanket of white, covering the world in silence. Snow angels lay in the yard, snowmen stood guard. My sister and I, we'd wage war in the snow, building forts of packed snow, our weapons snowballs hard as rocks. We were kings and queens of our own little kingdom, unaware of the world beyond our winter wonderland.",
            "You come to Portland, Oregon, you gotta understand something 'bout weird. It ain't just a word, it's a way of life.  See that sign on the side of that building, the one that serves up pizza by day and god knows what by night? \"Keep Portland Weird\" it says. Some reckon it's a whisper from the past, a ghost of the 90s, a time when this town was tucked away, cheaper and quieter, breeding its own strange breeds. Others, they hear it as a siren song, a call to come find acceptance, a place where different ain't a dirty word, it's a badge of honor.  \n\nBut the Californians keep pouring in, their money and their condos changing the landscape. Still, weird persists. It ain't about wallowing in some kind of radical acceptance, no sir. It's about finding a space for things that don't fit, things that make others squint and turn away. Like the rest of these United States, we buy our trinkets from the same distant shores.  We get our yoga, our hipsters, our suits and ties. Maybe weird just means we look at it all a little sideways.  \n\nTake my neighborhood, for instance.  You got houses painted in colors that'd make a fool blush, gardens bursting with flowers and herbs and things you can eat lining the sidewalks. And in the summer, the free boxes appear. Cardboard boxes, plastic bags, anything goes.  They hold the detritus of someone's life, cast off, abandoned. But inside, there's magic. A dress, a book, a tool, something unexpected, something meant for you. It ain't necessarily a treasure, but it's a possibility. That's Portland, ain't it? A place where the everyday holds a touch of the strange. \n\nThere's goat yoga, that's a thing here.  And soccer.  You got those who chase dreams, and those who chase the bottom of a bottle. We got our problems, sure.  Drugs, homelessness, the same old ghosts haunting every American town.  But even in the rain and the grey, there's a strange kind of beauty, a resilience. We're not so different, you and me, from the rest of them. We just wear our weirdness a little more proudly.",
            "The mountains. They were always there. Northward, sentinels against the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawns and dusks. A silent witness to it all.  Even when the mind went numb, consumed by the grind of things, they were there. Steady. Unmoved.  Unflinching.  And on those days when the weight of the world pressed down, when the soul felt frayed, they called to him.  A beckoning. A promise of solace.  He turned then, and in their presence, found a measure of peace. A strength to carry on. One day at a time.\n\nHe'd come here for college, drawn in by the mountains that clawed at the sky north of the campus. The university itself, with its halls and gardens, held a certain beauty, a kind of order. But the mountains, they held the throne. The town, in its own way, was a thing of grace. Cafés, stained with the ghosts of all-nighters fuelled by caffeine and ambition.  A short walk, a rumble of the bus, and the downtown hummed with a different kind of life.  Brick buildings, faded and worn, whispering of a past long gone.  Old stories etched in mortar. And then, a few streets on, the quiet of the suburbs returned. A library, a haven in a world of noise. This dance between the old and the new, the bustling and the still, it gave the place a strange kind of magic.\n\nMemories were made here, sharp and bright as shattered glass.  Laughter echoing through the park, the rusted swings creaking a mournful tune.  The rush of the city, a desperate sprint to catch a glimpse of the silver screen.  But there were shadows too, cast long and cold.  The ponds, still and reflecting, held their own sorrows. Tears shed in the dead of night, lost in the vastness of the world.  He watched the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each playing their part in the grand scheme.  And he wondered, for the hundredth time, about his own place in it all.\n\nHe walked, past the willow trees, past the houses that huddled together like frightened children.  He walked until the sun, a molten fist, broke over the horizon.  And then, he saw them. The mountains.  Staring down, unyielding, a silent testament to the passage of time. And in that moment, something stirred within him. A spark of defiance. A will to endure.",
            "The roads in Bensonhurst cling to the city like moss to stone. Finding it ain't hard.  The iron horse runs through it, spitting out souls from the belly of the beast. It's a place where concrete meets the sky, a symphony of car horns and the rumble of the subway.  Everywhere you turn, the scent of a thousand kitchens, the rattle of a thousand languages.  \n\nThe shops, they're like sentinels, mostly Asian faces behind the counters. You'll see them every block, a tapestry of bright signs promising cheap rice and spices. Markets overflowing with vegetables, laundromats churning like the river. Locals swear by them, say the food is good, the prices fair.  \n\nBut Bensonhurst ain't just a mosaic of faces. It's a crucible, where generations clash and mingle.  A kid born to Korean parents spitting out curses in Brooklynese.  A grandparent, eyes clouded with the ghosts of a homeland lost, pushing a stroller down the sidewalk.\n\nThere's a park, recently patched up, a sliver of green in the sea of grey.  A dozen basketball courts, a field where the ghosts of Little League dreams still linger.  Kids screaming, fathers arguing, the air thick with the smell of damp earth and sweat.  \n\nNo towering office blocks here, just rows of houses, two families crammed into each, the walls thin as paper.  And the noise, God, the noise.  Cars roaring down the streets, engines spitting fire, radios blasting the latest sins.  \n\nAt night, the shadows lengthen.  The streets are slick with a kind of uneasy peace.  You hold your breath, watch your back.  The city's darkness has a way of bringing out the worst in folks.  \n\nPickpockets, bullies, the occasional flash of violence.  I've seen it all. Heard the screams.  Even felt the sting of a fist.  But Bensonhurst ain't all bad.  It's a place where you learn to survive, to fight for every inch of ground.  It's a place where you come face to face with the raw, unfiltered heart of the city.",
            "The street runs slantwise down to the water, a crooked ribbon of cracked and crumbling asphalt.  Few sidewalks grace these parts, the sidewalkless road swallowed by the steep grade. They call it the \"work out hill,\" a kind of cruel joke for the runners who hammer their way up its face each day.  The houses cling to the shoulder of the slope, proud structures stacked high with glass eyes that stare out at the bay.  Always the bay. Always the hunger for the water.  The trees, those green sentinels, are an enemy here.  They must be cut back, pruned, trimmed, to give way to the endless vista.  The wires strung above, telephone and power, hang in tattered strands, their patchwork repairs testament to the storms that roll in from the sea.  Rain and wind, they come together in a ceaseless assault, stripping the bark from the trees, snapping branches, bringing down the lines.\n\nMoss, a green velvet, covers everything.  It creeps across roofs and cars, clings to the rusted railing of porch steps.  My car, left unattended in the driveway for a month, sprouted a thick coat of it, green and furry. Took hours to scrub it clean.\n\nChildren are scarce, but the schoolhouse stands sentinel a few blocks down. Mostly old folk live here, their days spent watching the tides and tending to their dogs.  Those dogs, they roam free, a pack of restless spirits, racing each other down the hill, noses twitching, tails wagging.  A loose window, an open door, and they'll be inside, their wet noses nudging your hand, their eyes pleading for a scratch.  Rabbits are feral here, a war waged between gardeners and hunters. My cats, sleek and nimble, have driven them from our yard.  Birds flit through the trees, sparrows and hummingbirds, a hawk or eagle occasionally soaring overhead until the crows, defenders of the sky, drive it away.\n\nDown by the water, a scattering of restaurants offer fresh catches from the bay, their tables spilling out onto the weathered docks.  No wide beach here, just rocky shores.  The bay, narrow and gray, offers a view of the distant shore, the outline hazy through the perpetual mist.",
            "The house sits at the corner, a front porch sentinel overlooking the thoroughfare. A ribbon of asphalt, choked by oaks and pines, connecting two blacktop arteries that bled through the town. Traffic, a steady murmur, a relentless current. Not a bad place, though. A quiet kind of livin'. Faces you see daily, the same weathered hands tending gardens, the same kids on bikes, the same dogs with stumpy legs and mournful eyes. Faces you know like the lines on your own palm. We work from the house. Me, the wife, the daughters, eleven and fourteen, shadows flitting in and out. We're part of the fabric here, the hum.\n\nWinter brings a brief respite from the heat, a dusting of snow that melts quick, leaving the children to slide down the hill that runs beside our street. We watch them from the porch, the smoke from our fire pit curling like ghosts against the leaden sky. Sometimes, a stranger's car, a foreign mark on the asphalt, rouses our curiosity.\n\nThe smell of grilling hangs heavy on the air sometimes, a reminder of summer nights and the slow, sweet rot of fallen leaves. Fall comes, a slow burn of gold and crimson, leaves crackling underfoot, a brittle whisper against the wind.\n\nThe garage, a sanctuary at the back of the house, a place of tools and work. When the doors rise, it feels like the neighborhood breathes in. On holidays, the air thickens with the murmur of voices, the slam of car doors. A brief intrusion, then, silence again.\n\nIt's a good place, quiet, familiar. A place where time moves slow, where the sun paints the trees in shades of rust and gold. A place where you can feel the pulse of the earth beneath your feet.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust. That's all that is. Brown. A tapestry of brown. The lawns, the few that dare to exist, are islands of green, monuments to a kind of desperate hope. Back in the nineties, the houses spread thin, like bones in the sand. Now they're closer, huddled together. This place, it's turning into something else. More like a city. \n\nPeople here, mostly good. Friendly. But like any place, there's a darkness, a shadow in the corners. The old folks around here, they're the kindest. Maybe that's why it feels safe. \n\nStores are chains. Food for Less, Smart & Final. The kind of places that sell cheap comfort.  You want something else, something better, you gotta drive.  Whole Foods, those things, they don't exist here.\n\nConstruction. That's the work. The dust in the air, the clang of hammers, the scrape of metal. This place is still young, still growing. It scares me, this spreading, this taking.  I left the city once. Not going back.\n\nMy hands, they know the feel of drywall, the bite of T-bars.  That's my trade.  \n\nThere's a beauty here, a starkness, a kind of quiet violence. Animals, they live here too. Lizards, bugs, things that scurry in the shadows. My kids, they love them. They chase them, study them.\n\nThe desert, it has its things.  Fairs, museums, mountains that wear white in the winter.  They call it Victorville. A place to see, a place to forget.  But it's a place that gets under your skin.",
            "The neighborhood.  A word that holds a weight different for some.  Folks talkin' 'bout their brick and mortar, their picket fences, their lawns mowed to a razor's edge.  Me, I reckon my neighborhood's different.  Walls ain't brick, but concrete and steel.  Fences, there are none.  The houses, they're dormitories, stacked high, holdin' a hundred souls each.  And the people, well, they're a motley crew.  Fresh faces, eyes wide with somethin' akin to hope, maybe fear.  Older ones, weathered by semesters past, carryin' the weight of knowledge like a burden.\n\nThere are three kinds of shelter in this place.  Apartments, cramped quarters for a handful, four or five souls to a room.  Then the houses, scattered like lonely sentinels, holdin' the alumni, them who've seen the world outside these walls.  And the dormitories, vast, echoing halls, where dreams are made and broken.  \n\nThe stores, they're a lifeline.  Grinding down burgers, slinging coffee, sellin' textbooks and T-shirts with the school's name emblazoned across them like a badge of honor.  And the park, a patch of green amidst the gray, a place for weary souls to find a moment's peace.\n\nThis neighborhood, it ain't like any other.  It's a crucible, forgin' lives, shapin' destinies.  It's a world unto itself, a microcosm of the world beyond.  And I, I'm just a small part of it.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  The dust settled different here in Stockbridge than it did back in Riverdale. It choked the air with a kind of sorrow I couldn't outrun.  Tears came easy then, for the ghosts of friends and laughter left behind. My folks, they talked of opportunity, of a better life for us, a life beyond the shadows.  They said Stockbridge would be good for us, a place to build a future. A place to be something more.\n\nThere was Mr. Glen and his children next door, always a flicker of light in the fading day. And Dennis, for a while, he was a fleeting warmth.  They became family, a thread of kinship in this strange new land.  I remember Mr. Glen's wedding, the sun sinking low over the horizon, the dust rising with each joyous footstep.  His bride, Ms. Veda, shed her white strap, a fragile thing that caught in my hand.  I didn't catch the flowers, but the memory lingers, a bittersweet bloom.\n\nThe neighborhood itself is a labyrinth, winding streets and hidden corners.  I used to navigate it blind, but now I have a guide, a metal box that whispers the way.  Kason and Curtis, they're my anchors here, the only constant in this shifting world.  We played games, chased shadows, sought solace in the flickering light of screens.  Sometimes, I'd wander to the park, where the wind whispered through the leaves and the air tasted of earth and silence.  There, I'd find a measure of peace, a quiet understanding.  I'd practice with my bokken, feel the weight of it in my hand, a promise of strength.\n\nThe basketball court stands silent, the net hanging limp. The tennis court, too, waits for the echo of bouncing balls, the clash of rackets.  My father, he taught me the game, the grace and fury of it all.  Mr. Graves, a gruff but kind man, he molded us, shaped us with sweat and discipline.\n\nThere are stories here, etched in the dust and whispers of the wind.  Stories of laughter and loss, of joy and sorrow.  These are the things that have marked my time here, the things that have made this place a part of me.\n\nBut the best is yet to come. The sun still rises, painting the sky with hope. And I, I am ready to greet it.",
            "The college sits close enough to walk, a fact that holds a certain comfort. The neighborhood, mostly blocks of brick and concrete, holds a few flickering lights of bars and eateries, places where the young and the worn gather, the cost of entry not unreasonable. One such place changed hands recently, its prices climbing, but the liquor flowed and the stories lingered. The faces here are mostly college boys and girls, or men and women worn thin by circumstance, drawn to the low rents. Children run barefoot in the streets, the sound of their laughter echoing off the faded walls, their haven a schoolhouse within shouting distance.\n\nI keep to myself, a solitary figure amidst the murmur of life. The people here, they smoke their weeds, a constant haze hanging in the air. The building manager, in his wisdom, installed an air freshener across from their door, a feeble attempt to mask the scent. A grim joke, a silent indictment.\n\nThe buildings themselves are old, their bones showing through the patched-up skin. Newer ones stand further down the street, gleaming faces with hollow insides. Cheaply built, they stand as monuments to greed, their rents a testament to the desperation of youth. A few blocks over, a greasy spoon serves its fare on paper plates, the aroma of microwaved mystery clinging to the air. Across the street, a gas station, a place of weary souls and broken promises.\n\nBut the city, in its infinite benevolence, redid the road last summer. A broad sidewalk now snakes through the neighborhood, lined with grass and trimmed trees. It's a poor attempt to mask the ugliness, but a gesture nonetheless.\n\nMy apartment building, it stands shrouded in trees, a few stumps marking the sacrifice of some fallen giants. The road behind it, 43rd Street, is a different beast altogether. The sidewalks are cracked and crumbling, the buildings lean and desperate. Trees cling to the edges, trying to hide the rot beneath. \n\nThe crime, it whispers in the shadows, a constant threat. Not confined to one place, it spreads like a disease, infecting the vulnerable.\nBut I make my home here. The rent is low, and the necessities are at hand. The college, a beacon of hope, sits within walking distance. Two bus stops offer a gateway to the wider world. I exist here, a small note in the symphony of the city, a fleeting breath in the face of the endless night.",
            "The houses here, they squat low, twins on a muted curve. Not crowded, not lonely. Yellow paint, white porches, roofs like rusted tin. Most folks know each other. We gather at dusk, at the end of driveways that lead nowhere in particular. Small voices chatter, children chasing dust devils and ghosts in the fading light. A breath of stillness in this world of clockwork and cold steel. Like stepping back, maybe.\n\nFields stretch out, emerald and gold, under skies the color of a summer sky. Clouds, like cotton blown loose, drift by. But there's a shadow over this peace. The wind whispers warnings of things unseen, of teeth tearing at the world. Last night, the sirens screamed, a chorus of steel and fear. I found myself in the tub, my smallest dog pressed against my chest, my purse and a few pillows for company. The big one wouldn't budge, whimpering, pacing the living room. Out there, the sky cracked open with hail, fat and angry, drumming on the roof. After the storm, the air hung thick, the ground steaming like a wound. Heat and cold, a sudden, brutal dance. Then, a light, a rupture in the grey. A double rainbow arched across the sky, a fragile promise. I grabbed my phone, the screen catching the light, and snapped pictures, trying to hold the beauty before it faded. \n\nThe world settled, quiet again, save for the chirping of crickets. Then, slow, the neighborhood stirred. Doors opened, children ran, laughter spilled out. Back to the rhythm of things. Mom's stirring pots, children chasing fireflies.\n\nThis place, it's a haven. Forty minutes from the city, but a world away. The folks here, they speak slow, their words like honey. Two rooms, two baths, that's all we need. But inside, each house is a story waiting to be told.\n\nI walk out back, past the fields, to the pond, still and silent. Deer graze in the shadows, and the bullfrog's song, a deep rumble, fills the morning air. A rooster crows, a lonely sound in the vastness. A donkey brays, somewhere in the distance. A small community, a piece of the old world. I found my peace here.",
            "The house stood empty when I came. Eighth grade. A year of shadows. Made friends slow, like roots burrowing deep. Two boys, down the street, a house two over. They're gone now, but the ghosts of their laughter still linger in the porch swing. The old folks, they're still here, faces etched with the stories of the years. \n\nSame houses, two stories reaching for a sky that never seems to change. Kids on the street, their voices a symphony of summer days. Mostly quiet, this place. You're left alone unless you need something. Packages sit safe on the stoop, untouched. Trust hangs in the air, thin but real.\n\nThere's a park, a stone's throw away. Memories live there too, etched on the worn swings and cracked asphalt. Ball games, laughter, the sting of a well-aimed elbow to the nose. Football days, the sun a furnace in the sky. Now, it's the young ones, my cousin's brood, their faces lit with the joy of slides and swings. Their laughter, a echo of a past life. The park, a well of quiet longing.\n\nFood smells drift on the wind. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian. A world in a mile's radius. But the world has changed. Now, food arrives at the doorstep, a Ghostly offering from apps and screens. Fast food reigns, a familiar comfort. Pizza, a solace for the weary soul. The stores, they have everything. Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store with aisles that stretch to eternity. Even a shop, Indian-owned, smelling of spices and home.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a haven. A place where the light is still warm, where the air carries the scent of home. Reading the news, seeing the darkness in other places, makes me grateful for this quiet corner of the world. A place where neighbors are more than just faces on a street.",
            "The town sits small, nestled in the Carolina heat. A peach town, they call it, the world's peach capital they say, though that sign hanging crooked at the edge of town don't mean much to the wind.  Fields crawl out from the houses, one neat row of trees or another, cattle grazing under the sun.  Houses stand back from the road, two stories high, metal roofs glinting like scars against the blue, or gray shingles worn thin by years. Few of them face the dust, most turned inward. \n\nA lone light hangs over the crossroads, a single eye blinking in the stillness. Three places to eat, maybe four if you count the Chinese place. Hong Kong, they call it, run by a family silent as the graves. Fiesta, bright enough to burn your eyes, and Gary's, where the burgers are flat and the grease hangs heavy. The pizza place closed down, leaving a hollow space in the air. \n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, a name worn thin with time. They sell cherry Coke, sweet and dark, like the secrets the town keeps. The IGA, a little store with a big name, crammed full of things you need and things you don't.  Folks go there for a carton of milk, a loaf of bread, but the real shopping's done in Batesburg-Leesville, down the road. Dollar General, though, that's where the heart of the town beats. Crowded and humming, a place where you can find anything and everything. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, built solid as the earth. A kind woman runs it, knows everyone's name, knows their stories. Clark's Cuts and Kennels sits attached, a place for dogs to be groomed and loved.  The doctor's office and the vet, both small, tucked away like secrets.  A single schoolhouse, teaching children the alphabet and the ways of the world. \n\nNo parks, no laughter in the streets, just the quiet rustle of leaves and the low hum of cicadas. They're building a place for kids to play, a patch of green in the dusty landscape. But still, it's a town that sleeps, a place where time slows down and secrets breed like rabbits.  You could drive right through without knowing it, a blink and you'd miss it.",
            "The first time the name of this place drifted into my ears, it was on some vanished voices podcast. A tale of disappearances. Strange thing, considering the rent here. A thousand a month, easy. Never heard a whisper of it, not from any of the boys I knew. Maybe it's the struggle. Some nights I see them, eyes red-rimmed, hollowed out, weeping. The cost of living, a heavy stone in the gut. But we've learned to mend with scraps. The scent of moth-eaten things, the dusty charm of flea market finds. You learn to smell less, in time. Or maybe the smoke gets you. Whatever the case, the flea market, it always calls. The smell of adulthood, a musty echo of time. Dusty magazines piled on a silent piano. It sinks into the leather, a stain that won't wash out. Here, three thrift shops within walking distance. Start at the edge and you can tick off two charities, a library, a bookstore old as sin, and a curio shop crammed full of whispers. Downtown, a river of iron and flesh, choked with cars and people every morning. But the silence in those shops, it's a shroud. No matter the traffic, the din, the silence holds. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more of them, the cars and the people. They call it development, I guess. A city growing its bones, hosting the titans of online commerce. Still, the pangs of progress, they show. Like New York, I reckon. Everyone with their own face set, their own path. No one asking much of you. You can be a ghost, quiet and alone, and no one bats an eye. Not like the South, where a sigh means you care. Here, they keep their lives shut tight. You can wear your mask as long as you like, and the city will roll on, waves against the shore. A lively place, though. Between the pianist next door and the two souls upstairs, always a melody hanging in the air. We ain't strangers here, not quite. We gather for needs, for birthdays, for funerals, for each other when the going gets rough. Lucky, I reckon. Most of the neighbors, decent folks. Treat me right, I return the favor. Food left on the stoop, mail delivered, a hand extended. A smile, a nod. Makes a man feel less alone in this concrete jungle.",
            "The place I call home, it sprawls out like a grid of sameness.  Rows of houses, each a mirror image of the next, all singing the same song of conformity.  The Homeowners' Association, a silent shepherd, dictates the tune.  Every yard a uniform stage set: a patch of manicured green, pebbles scattered like glacial drift, and driveways short enough for the soul to tire before the car.  The occasional tree, stunted and pruned, stands witness.  Two-car garages, all identical, line the streets.  Concrete, newly laid and smooth as a preacher's promise, stretches on, a testament to order.  Families come and go, but the roads remain unblemished, free of the scars of time and broken dreams.\n\nMost houses, one story, rooted in the earth.  Some reach for the sky, two stories tall, like prayers unanswered.  Mailboxes, not the lonely sentinels you'd expect, but a huddled cluster at the end of the lane, guarded and uniform.  Keys turn, metal groans, and the secrets of daily life are retrieved.  Lockers stand sentinel for packages, their metal hearts cold and uncaring.  The HOA, its hand in every detail, its grip tight.\n\nMy house sits on the edge of the city, a place where the urban bleeds into the wild.  We have land here, plenty of it.  Pools, fenced and shimmering, offer a taste of paradise.  Trails wind through the green, paths for those who seek solace in the rustling leaves and the murmur of the wind.  Exercise, not a chore, but a rite of passage in this land of open spaces.\n\nThe people here, mostly old, their faces etched with the stories of lives lived.  Their eyes hold a quiet wisdom, a knowingness born of years.  There are a few younger faces, these newcomers, lost in the labyrinth of ambition.  But all are connected, bound by the invisible threads of this small town, a place where strangers become neighbors, and neighbors become family.\n\nThe city, though vast, whispers of a time gone by.  A single mall, a monolith of commerce, stands as a testament to our needs and desires.  Fifteen minutes, a blink in the grand scheme of things, and the world opens up, a kaleidoscope of choices.  From the purveyors of organic greens to the masters of discounted dreams, there's a place for every soul. \n\nThis is my home.  Safe, predictable, and yet, somehow, still yearning for something more.",
            "The town sits low, a bruise on the flank of the city.  East side. That's where I dwell.  Houses huddle close, weathered wood and chipped paint.  Folks here, they scrape by. Renters and owners, all with eyes that have seen hard times.  But there's a kind of quiet grace in their faces.  A nod on the street, a word shared, the air thick with understanding.  \n\nCrime, it crawls like a weed in the cracks.  A few shots in the night, a life pinched out too soon.  Lost a boy next door, they did.  Taken by a bullet outside some darkened bar.  The echoes still linger.  We've had things go missing, a coat left on the porch, a bike left unlocked.  Just the way of things here.\n\nThe sickness, that's the real shadow.  The white powder, a whisper on the wind, taking hold, stealing breath.  They say it's everywhere, this curse.  But here, there are hands reaching out, trying to pull folks back from the edge.  Places to mend, to find a foothold.  A flicker of hope.\n\nBut the school, it's a haven.  Teachers with hearts as big as the sky, guiding young minds.  My son, he struggles, but they see him, they hold him up.  No scorn, no whispers.  Just kindness, a steady hand.  The PTO, they work hard, keeping the spirit alive, bringing families together.  Free meals for every child, so no empty stomachs at the table.  They understand, they care.\n\nThe town itself, it's a patchwork.  New roads, blooming flowers, parks freshly painted, all on the west side, where the money flows.  But here, on the east side, the cracks show deeper.  A feeling of being forgotten.\n\nStill, I love it here.  The quiet strength, the shared burdens, the hard-won beauty.  This town, it's in my blood now.  We've made it our own.  And even though there's darkness, there's also light.  A stubborn, enduring light.",
            "The Hill holds its breath against the city. Seven stories above, I look out at the old theater, brick and shadow, a relic of what was. Down the slope, a flicker of neon betrays the arcade bar, a den of laughter and hushed whispers on summer nights. The line spills out, a river of faces seeking solace in the dark. A few blocks on, the park rises, walled in concrete, steps leading up like broken teeth. Winter comes, a grey shroud, and the men and women take shelter, tents in neat rows along the sidewalk, huddled against the city's bones. They share the scant warmth, closer to the family center, a flicker of hope in the cold, where they might find a moment's peace. \n\nThe Hill wasn't always this way. Stories linger, whispers in the wind, of the days when shadows danced with violence, of the men in suits, the badges gleaming, sweeping through the streets like a storm. They say the ghosts of those days still walk among us, etched into the faces of the people who call it home. They work hard, these people, their hands calloused, their hearts weary. They tend to their streets, fight for a sliver of light in the darkness. They warn the newcomers, the pale faces who wander in at night, \"Don't walk alone after dark.\"  A shadow of the old fears, a whisper of the past.\n\nMaybe it's the way the light catches my skin, maybe it's the way I walk, blending into the shadows. But the Hill sees something in me, a kindred spirit. It sees the scars, the reminders that we are all searching for something, something more than this, something better. It sees the fight, the struggle, the yearning for a world where the only shadows are those cast by the setting sun. \n\nI walk these streets, feeling the pulse of the city beneath my feet. I see kindness in the lines on their faces, hear it in their voices, feel it in the warmth of a shared smile. This is my home, this rough, beautiful place. This is where I belong.",
            "The land here stretches flat as a dead man's hand. Farmland gives way to towns that cater to the summer crowd, the kind with boat keys jingling in their pockets and flip-flops slapping on the pavement. No towering steel and glass here, no chains with names like Applebee's or Target.  You want something, you gotta drive for it.  But there's beauty in the vastness.  Two Great Lakes hug this place, Michigan's dark water on one side, Charlevoix's turquoise mirror on the other.  Every turn offers a dip in the sand, a taste of the cool current.  \n\nThe houses are scattered, not crammed like teeth in a mouthful.  They're old bones, some patched and freshened, others with the patina of time worn into their skin.  Siding the color of tarnished silver, a faded testament to summers past.  Every shade imaginable, like a child's box of crayons spilled across the street.  Yards, choked with weeds maybe, or manicured tight, each telling a story.  Kids on swings, dogs chasing squirrels, gardens bursting with life. This is the heart of it, the backbone of the country.  Hard-working folks, raising families, the rhythm of life pulsing slow and steady.\n\nYou'll see the sheriff's station, solid and squat, like a watchful dog.  The jail next door, a reminder that darkness lurks even in the quietest corners. The health department, too, a beacon of order in the chaos.  Down the road, the recycling center, where the refuse of life is reborn. And the baseball field, where the crack of the bat echoes through the dusk.  The airport, a tiny speck on the horizon, spitting out dreams on wings of steel.\n\nThis is a place you don't come to for the spectacle.  It's a place to settle, to put down roots.  A place where the air is clean and the stars are bright.  It's a place where you can raise your children, knowing they'll grow strong and true.  It's a place where you can finally rest."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city sprawls, a concrete and steel beast. Neighborhoods stitched together in a haphazard quilt, commerce bleeding into residence. Shops and offices pressed tight against each other, a dizzying array of storefront signs bleeding neon into the dusk. Eating places, a constant hum of ovens and sizzling grease, promising quick sustenance. Big chains with their cold, sterile promises, and smaller shops, tucked along the choked streets, whispers of individuality. Parks, green islands in the gray, choked with the laughter of children and the drone of cicadas. \n\nFaces, a kaleidoscope of shades and tongues.  Here a cluster of rainbow flags, there a synagogue, its windows a lattice of prayer. A scattering of souls, displaced, from the cold wastelands of the East. Beyond the immediate sprawl, the city’s heart beats with a thousand nameless rhythms. Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia – pockets of the world nestled against each other, miles swallowed by the city’s endless maw.  Iron horses on steel tracks, choked by exhaust and the weight of a thousand journeys.  Ten miles, a journey into the belly of the beast, a crawl through time. \n\nConcrete canyons rise, new towers reaching for a sky choked with smog.  Promises of easy living, a tide of souls drawn to the city’s siren song. But old wounds fester, the neighborhood’s heart grows heavy with the burden of too many. \n\nHouses, a patchwork of dreams. Some stand alone, sentinels against the encroaching tide. Others huddle together, families seeking solace in shared walls. Even here, in the heart of the city, the human spirit seeks connection. But the streets are long and the shadows deep. Faces pass, strangers in the anonymity of the city. Memories linger, of laughter and shared secrets, a child's world fading in the city's relentless churn.",
            "The houses huddled close, most single-family, some split, two lives breathin' in one skin. My own sits on a patch of lawn, a drive beside it cracked and thirsty. Like the others, it remembers a time when this was the dream, the edges of the country tamed, promise in every picket fence. Now the dream's pullin' away, leavin' a chill in the air. But the houses hold on, whisperin' the old stories, a stubborn echo in the wind. \n\nFolks ain't as bright-eyed as they used to be. Lawns ain't kept like they used to be. But the cars still sit, iron nests in the drives, and the children play, the world their own. The school, a brick sentinel standin' near ninety years, still calls to the young, stirs the ghosts in the old. Churches sit empty, hollow bones against the sky, but the courts echo with the slap of sneakers, the sharp cries of the game.\n\nEach house different, yet the same ache in their bones. The Super \"A\" stands tall, a concrete monolith, run by a family from a land far away, their faces veiled. Black faces fill the streets, generations deep. The children kick a ball, the air thick with dust and hope. The youth remember a time when everyone knew everyone. The karate school, a memory now, replaced by a place where pills promise answers. The movie theater shows old films, a flicker of light in the dusk, favored by the old, who remember a time when stories unfolded on a silver screen.\n\nA ribbon of road slices through the town, but the on and off ramps lie beyond, in another's domain. There was talk of a change, a new path, a way to ease the flow. The young yearned for it, the old resisted, their grip on the past a thorny vine. Now a new school rises, a monument to the future, and the town debates its spirit, its soul. A cyborg, they say, with a drawl and a log cabin, a strange reflection of a world caught between the old and the new.",
            "You might pass it over, this place. Just another row of houses behind the bony ribs of a dead shopping center. Not the kind of place you'd think to find  dwellings, not the kind folks yearn for. But if you cut through the rust and the weeds behind the husk of that old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty most of the year, filled only with ghosts of summer reunions, you'd find it. A whole world tucked in behind the shadows. \n\nApartment blocks huddled there, like nesting dolls unmade and laid out in a row. Each one a secret chamber. The first ones you'd see, they'd be the ones the news boys had chewed on, scandal and whispers clinging to their walls. But turn your back on those, and the ones next door, the ones after that, they hold a different kind of story.  \n\nAcross the road, a college satellite campus, a whisper of learning against the sunbaked asphalt. Students trailing in, coffee cups in hand, yawning like the world hadn't quite woken up yet. The iron gates groan open, letting them in one by one, while commuters curse them, shaking their fists, impatient for the road to be theirs again. \n\nThe road runs into another street, lined with houses and a park. On one side the park, children whirling in the sun, a blur of legs and laughter. On the other, a place for mending broken bones, a haven for the injured. Cheerful furniture spills out onto the porch, a ceiling fan sighing in the humid air, pushing the heat back and forth like a restless spirit. \n\nA sushi place hums beside the park, cheap eats and the quiet clinking of chopsticks. A swimming supply store, a nail salon, all nestled together in the strip mall. A frozen yogurt place, the kind where kids pile on the toppings, their cups sweating in the sun, their laughter as bright and sharp as broken glass.\n\nThis place, it's a picture postcard, faded and cracked, a glimpse of a time that's gone and come back around again. The south, slow and sweet, where the days stretch long and nothing ever truly changes, not even time itself.",
            "\"Where's everything?\" she asked, the car rumbling past fields of corn that stretched to the horizon. An endless sea of green, she'd never seen such a thing. This close to the earth, it was a different life altogether.  \"This is it,\" I said, knowing the emptiness would take her aback. She'd grown up where the grocery store was a stone's throw from your door. Open space wasn't in her blood. \n\nI told her about growing up in the Ohio dust, the endless fields, the way the wind could whip across the land and steal your breath. In that moment, she saw a part of me she hadn't known was there.\n\nDown a two-lane road, past a quarry filled with the still water of a forgotten lake, the houses huddled together like sheep. Brick and stucco, each with a half acre of land, a patch of green to call their own. Come spring, the flowers would burst forth, a riot of color against the backdrop of the changing seasons. Driveways would fill with high-gloss Mercedes, gleaming like beetles in the midday sun after a bath.\n\nMy neighbor, a Korean man, would be out there, his John Deere mower humming a lonely tune. He'd been a doctor once, they said, but now he tended his lawn with the devotion of a priest tending to his altar. He'd sing a little, sometimes, his voice thin and reedy, but always kind. They all laughed at him, but he didn't seem to mind. He was a good man, a quiet man, with stories etched into his face.\n\nPast his house, mine stood, grey stucco against the endless blue. Geese honked from the side yard, our terrier snapping at their heels. Behind the house, a stream ran clear and cold, feeding the quarry. Bullfrogs croaked, and the low moo of a distant cow filled the air. A handmade wooden bridge led to an oasis, untouched and wild, a tangle of trees and wildflowers. That's where I spent my days, building forts, chasing rabbits, dreaming.\n\nWinter came hard, a cold fist clenching around the land. The green turned brown, the trees bare skeletons against the grey sky. But the snow, when it came, was a blessing. A blanket of white, covering the world in silence. Snow angels lay in the yard, snowmen stood guard. My sister and I, we'd wage war in the snow, building forts of packed snow, our weapons snowballs hard as rocks. We were kings and queens of our own little kingdom, unaware of the world beyond our winter wonderland.",
            "You come to Portland, Oregon, you gotta understand something 'bout weird. It ain't just a word, it's a way of life.  See that sign on the side of that building, the one that serves up pizza by day and god knows what by night? \"Keep Portland Weird\" it says. Some reckon it's a whisper from the past, a ghost of the 90s, a time when this town was tucked away, cheaper and quieter, breeding its own strange breeds. Others, they hear it as a siren song, a call to come find acceptance, a place where different ain't a dirty word, it's a badge of honor.  \n\nBut the Californians keep pouring in, their money and their condos changing the landscape. Still, weird persists. It ain't about wallowing in some kind of radical acceptance, no sir. It's about finding a space for things that don't fit, things that make others squint and turn away. Like the rest of these United States, we buy our trinkets from the same distant shores.  We get our yoga, our hipsters, our suits and ties. Maybe weird just means we look at it all a little sideways.  \n\nTake my neighborhood, for instance.  You got houses painted in colors that'd make a fool blush, gardens bursting with flowers and herbs and things you can eat lining the sidewalks. And in the summer, the free boxes appear. Cardboard boxes, plastic bags, anything goes.  They hold the detritus of someone's life, cast off, abandoned. But inside, there's magic. A dress, a book, a tool, something unexpected, something meant for you. It ain't necessarily a treasure, but it's a possibility. That's Portland, ain't it? A place where the everyday holds a touch of the strange. \n\nThere's goat yoga, that's a thing here.  And soccer.  You got those who chase dreams, and those who chase the bottom of a bottle. We got our problems, sure.  Drugs, homelessness, the same old ghosts haunting every American town.  But even in the rain and the grey, there's a strange kind of beauty, a resilience. We're not so different, you and me, from the rest of them. We just wear our weirdness a little more proudly.",
            "The mountains. They were always there. Northward, sentinels against the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawns and dusks. A silent witness to it all.  Even when the mind went numb, consumed by the grind of things, they were there. Steady. Unmoved.  Unflinching.  And on those days when the weight of the world pressed down, when the soul felt frayed, they called to him.  A beckoning. A promise of solace.  He turned then, and in their presence, found a measure of peace. A strength to carry on. One day at a time.\n\nHe'd come here for college, drawn in by the mountains that clawed at the sky north of the campus. The university itself, with its halls and gardens, held a certain beauty, a kind of order. But the mountains, they held the throne. The town, in its own way, was a thing of grace. Cafés, stained with the ghosts of all-nighters fuelled by caffeine and ambition.  A short walk, a rumble of the bus, and the downtown hummed with a different kind of life.  Brick buildings, faded and worn, whispering of a past long gone.  Old stories etched in mortar. And then, a few streets on, the quiet of the suburbs returned. A library, a haven in a world of noise. This dance between the old and the new, the bustling and the still, it gave the place a strange kind of magic.\n\nMemories were made here, sharp and bright as shattered glass.  Laughter echoing through the park, the rusted swings creaking a mournful tune.  The rush of the city, a desperate sprint to catch a glimpse of the silver screen.  But there were shadows too, cast long and cold.  The ponds, still and reflecting, held their own sorrows. Tears shed in the dead of night, lost in the vastness of the world.  He watched the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each playing their part in the grand scheme.  And he wondered, for the hundredth time, about his own place in it all.\n\nHe walked, past the willow trees, past the houses that huddled together like frightened children.  He walked until the sun, a molten fist, broke over the horizon.  And then, he saw them. The mountains.  Staring down, unyielding, a silent testament to the passage of time. And in that moment, something stirred within him. A spark of defiance. A will to endure.",
            "The roads in Bensonhurst cling to the city like moss to stone. Finding it ain't hard.  The iron horse runs through it, spitting out souls from the belly of the beast. It's a place where concrete meets the sky, a symphony of car horns and the rumble of the subway.  Everywhere you turn, the scent of a thousand kitchens, the rattle of a thousand languages.  \n\nThe shops, they're like sentinels, mostly Asian faces behind the counters. You'll see them every block, a tapestry of bright signs promising cheap rice and spices. Markets overflowing with vegetables, laundromats churning like the river. Locals swear by them, say the food is good, the prices fair.  \n\nBut Bensonhurst ain't just a mosaic of faces. It's a crucible, where generations clash and mingle.  A kid born to Korean parents spitting out curses in Brooklynese.  A grandparent, eyes clouded with the ghosts of a homeland lost, pushing a stroller down the sidewalk.\n\nThere's a park, recently patched up, a sliver of green in the sea of grey.  A dozen basketball courts, a field where the ghosts of Little League dreams still linger.  Kids screaming, fathers arguing, the air thick with the smell of damp earth and sweat.  \n\nNo towering office blocks here, just rows of houses, two families crammed into each, the walls thin as paper.  And the noise, God, the noise.  Cars roaring down the streets, engines spitting fire, radios blasting the latest sins.  \n\nAt night, the shadows lengthen.  The streets are slick with a kind of uneasy peace.  You hold your breath, watch your back.  The city's darkness has a way of bringing out the worst in folks.  \n\nPickpockets, bullies, the occasional flash of violence.  I've seen it all. Heard the screams.  Even felt the sting of a fist.  But Bensonhurst ain't all bad.  It's a place where you learn to survive, to fight for every inch of ground.  It's a place where you come face to face with the raw, unfiltered heart of the city.",
            "The street runs slantwise down to the water, a crooked ribbon of cracked and crumbling asphalt.  Few sidewalks grace these parts, the sidewalkless road swallowed by the steep grade. They call it the \"work out hill,\" a kind of cruel joke for the runners who hammer their way up its face each day.  The houses cling to the shoulder of the slope, proud structures stacked high with glass eyes that stare out at the bay.  Always the bay. Always the hunger for the water.  The trees, those green sentinels, are an enemy here.  They must be cut back, pruned, trimmed, to give way to the endless vista.  The wires strung above, telephone and power, hang in tattered strands, their patchwork repairs testament to the storms that roll in from the sea.  Rain and wind, they come together in a ceaseless assault, stripping the bark from the trees, snapping branches, bringing down the lines.\n\nMoss, a green velvet, covers everything.  It creeps across roofs and cars, clings to the rusted railing of porch steps.  My car, left unattended in the driveway for a month, sprouted a thick coat of it, green and furry. Took hours to scrub it clean.\n\nChildren are scarce, but the schoolhouse stands sentinel a few blocks down. Mostly old folk live here, their days spent watching the tides and tending to their dogs.  Those dogs, they roam free, a pack of restless spirits, racing each other down the hill, noses twitching, tails wagging.  A loose window, an open door, and they'll be inside, their wet noses nudging your hand, their eyes pleading for a scratch.  Rabbits are feral here, a war waged between gardeners and hunters. My cats, sleek and nimble, have driven them from our yard.  Birds flit through the trees, sparrows and hummingbirds, a hawk or eagle occasionally soaring overhead until the crows, defenders of the sky, drive it away.\n\nDown by the water, a scattering of restaurants offer fresh catches from the bay, their tables spilling out onto the weathered docks.  No wide beach here, just rocky shores.  The bay, narrow and gray, offers a view of the distant shore, the outline hazy through the perpetual mist.",
            "The house sits at the corner, a front porch sentinel overlooking the thoroughfare. A ribbon of asphalt, choked by oaks and pines, connecting two blacktop arteries that bled through the town. Traffic, a steady murmur, a relentless current. Not a bad place, though. A quiet kind of livin'. Faces you see daily, the same weathered hands tending gardens, the same kids on bikes, the same dogs with stumpy legs and mournful eyes. Faces you know like the lines on your own palm. We work from the house. Me, the wife, the daughters, eleven and fourteen, shadows flitting in and out. We're part of the fabric here, the hum.\n\nWinter brings a brief respite from the heat, a dusting of snow that melts quick, leaving the children to slide down the hill that runs beside our street. We watch them from the porch, the smoke from our fire pit curling like ghosts against the leaden sky. Sometimes, a stranger's car, a foreign mark on the asphalt, rouses our curiosity.\n\nThe smell of grilling hangs heavy on the air sometimes, a reminder of summer nights and the slow, sweet rot of fallen leaves. Fall comes, a slow burn of gold and crimson, leaves crackling underfoot, a brittle whisper against the wind.\n\nThe garage, a sanctuary at the back of the house, a place of tools and work. When the doors rise, it feels like the neighborhood breathes in. On holidays, the air thickens with the murmur of voices, the slam of car doors. A brief intrusion, then, silence again.\n\nIt's a good place, quiet, familiar. A place where time moves slow, where the sun paints the trees in shades of rust and gold. A place where you can feel the pulse of the earth beneath your feet.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust. That's all that is. Brown. A tapestry of brown. The lawns, the few that dare to exist, are islands of green, monuments to a kind of desperate hope. Back in the nineties, the houses spread thin, like bones in the sand. Now they're closer, huddled together. This place, it's turning into something else. More like a city. \n\nPeople here, mostly good. Friendly. But like any place, there's a darkness, a shadow in the corners. The old folks around here, they're the kindest. Maybe that's why it feels safe. \n\nStores are chains. Food for Less, Smart & Final. The kind of places that sell cheap comfort.  You want something else, something better, you gotta drive.  Whole Foods, those things, they don't exist here.\n\nConstruction. That's the work. The dust in the air, the clang of hammers, the scrape of metal. This place is still young, still growing. It scares me, this spreading, this taking.  I left the city once. Not going back.\n\nMy hands, they know the feel of drywall, the bite of T-bars.  That's my trade.  \n\nThere's a beauty here, a starkness, a kind of quiet violence. Animals, they live here too. Lizards, bugs, things that scurry in the shadows. My kids, they love them. They chase them, study them.\n\nThe desert, it has its things.  Fairs, museums, mountains that wear white in the winter.  They call it Victorville. A place to see, a place to forget.  But it's a place that gets under your skin.",
            "The neighborhood.  A word that holds a weight different for some.  Folks talkin' 'bout their brick and mortar, their picket fences, their lawns mowed to a razor's edge.  Me, I reckon my neighborhood's different.  Walls ain't brick, but concrete and steel.  Fences, there are none.  The houses, they're dormitories, stacked high, holdin' a hundred souls each.  And the people, well, they're a motley crew.  Fresh faces, eyes wide with somethin' akin to hope, maybe fear.  Older ones, weathered by semesters past, carryin' the weight of knowledge like a burden.\n\nThere are three kinds of shelter in this place.  Apartments, cramped quarters for a handful, four or five souls to a room.  Then the houses, scattered like lonely sentinels, holdin' the alumni, them who've seen the world outside these walls.  And the dormitories, vast, echoing halls, where dreams are made and broken.  \n\nThe stores, they're a lifeline.  Grinding down burgers, slinging coffee, sellin' textbooks and T-shirts with the school's name emblazoned across them like a badge of honor.  And the park, a patch of green amidst the gray, a place for weary souls to find a moment's peace.\n\nThis neighborhood, it ain't like any other.  It's a crucible, forgin' lives, shapin' destinies.  It's a world unto itself, a microcosm of the world beyond.  And I, I'm just a small part of it.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  The dust settled different here in Stockbridge than it did back in Riverdale. It choked the air with a kind of sorrow I couldn't outrun.  Tears came easy then, for the ghosts of friends and laughter left behind. My folks, they talked of opportunity, of a better life for us, a life beyond the shadows.  They said Stockbridge would be good for us, a place to build a future. A place to be something more.\n\nThere was Mr. Glen and his children next door, always a flicker of light in the fading day. And Dennis, for a while, he was a fleeting warmth.  They became family, a thread of kinship in this strange new land.  I remember Mr. Glen's wedding, the sun sinking low over the horizon, the dust rising with each joyous footstep.  His bride, Ms. Veda, shed her white strap, a fragile thing that caught in my hand.  I didn't catch the flowers, but the memory lingers, a bittersweet bloom.\n\nThe neighborhood itself is a labyrinth, winding streets and hidden corners.  I used to navigate it blind, but now I have a guide, a metal box that whispers the way.  Kason and Curtis, they're my anchors here, the only constant in this shifting world.  We played games, chased shadows, sought solace in the flickering light of screens.  Sometimes, I'd wander to the park, where the wind whispered through the leaves and the air tasted of earth and silence.  There, I'd find a measure of peace, a quiet understanding.  I'd practice with my bokken, feel the weight of it in my hand, a promise of strength.\n\nThe basketball court stands silent, the net hanging limp. The tennis court, too, waits for the echo of bouncing balls, the clash of rackets.  My father, he taught me the game, the grace and fury of it all.  Mr. Graves, a gruff but kind man, he molded us, shaped us with sweat and discipline.\n\nThere are stories here, etched in the dust and whispers of the wind.  Stories of laughter and loss, of joy and sorrow.  These are the things that have marked my time here, the things that have made this place a part of me.\n\nBut the best is yet to come. The sun still rises, painting the sky with hope. And I, I am ready to greet it.",
            "The college sits close enough to walk, a fact that holds a certain comfort. The neighborhood, mostly blocks of brick and concrete, holds a few flickering lights of bars and eateries, places where the young and the worn gather, the cost of entry not unreasonable. One such place changed hands recently, its prices climbing, but the liquor flowed and the stories lingered. The faces here are mostly college boys and girls, or men and women worn thin by circumstance, drawn to the low rents. Children run barefoot in the streets, the sound of their laughter echoing off the faded walls, their haven a schoolhouse within shouting distance.\n\nI keep to myself, a solitary figure amidst the murmur of life. The people here, they smoke their weeds, a constant haze hanging in the air. The building manager, in his wisdom, installed an air freshener across from their door, a feeble attempt to mask the scent. A grim joke, a silent indictment.\n\nThe buildings themselves are old, their bones showing through the patched-up skin. Newer ones stand further down the street, gleaming faces with hollow insides. Cheaply built, they stand as monuments to greed, their rents a testament to the desperation of youth. A few blocks over, a greasy spoon serves its fare on paper plates, the aroma of microwaved mystery clinging to the air. Across the street, a gas station, a place of weary souls and broken promises.\n\nBut the city, in its infinite benevolence, redid the road last summer. A broad sidewalk now snakes through the neighborhood, lined with grass and trimmed trees. It's a poor attempt to mask the ugliness, but a gesture nonetheless.\n\nMy apartment building, it stands shrouded in trees, a few stumps marking the sacrifice of some fallen giants. The road behind it, 43rd Street, is a different beast altogether. The sidewalks are cracked and crumbling, the buildings lean and desperate. Trees cling to the edges, trying to hide the rot beneath. \n\nThe crime, it whispers in the shadows, a constant threat. Not confined to one place, it spreads like a disease, infecting the vulnerable.\nBut I make my home here. The rent is low, and the necessities are at hand. The college, a beacon of hope, sits within walking distance. Two bus stops offer a gateway to the wider world. I exist here, a small note in the symphony of the city, a fleeting breath in the face of the endless night.",
            "The houses here, they squat low, twins on a muted curve. Not crowded, not lonely. Yellow paint, white porches, roofs like rusted tin. Most folks know each other. We gather at dusk, at the end of driveways that lead nowhere in particular. Small voices chatter, children chasing dust devils and ghosts in the fading light. A breath of stillness in this world of clockwork and cold steel. Like stepping back, maybe.\n\nFields stretch out, emerald and gold, under skies the color of a summer sky. Clouds, like cotton blown loose, drift by. But there's a shadow over this peace. The wind whispers warnings of things unseen, of teeth tearing at the world. Last night, the sirens screamed, a chorus of steel and fear. I found myself in the tub, my smallest dog pressed against my chest, my purse and a few pillows for company. The big one wouldn't budge, whimpering, pacing the living room. Out there, the sky cracked open with hail, fat and angry, drumming on the roof. After the storm, the air hung thick, the ground steaming like a wound. Heat and cold, a sudden, brutal dance. Then, a light, a rupture in the grey. A double rainbow arched across the sky, a fragile promise. I grabbed my phone, the screen catching the light, and snapped pictures, trying to hold the beauty before it faded. \n\nThe world settled, quiet again, save for the chirping of crickets. Then, slow, the neighborhood stirred. Doors opened, children ran, laughter spilled out. Back to the rhythm of things. Mom's stirring pots, children chasing fireflies.\n\nThis place, it's a haven. Forty minutes from the city, but a world away. The folks here, they speak slow, their words like honey. Two rooms, two baths, that's all we need. But inside, each house is a story waiting to be told.\n\nI walk out back, past the fields, to the pond, still and silent. Deer graze in the shadows, and the bullfrog's song, a deep rumble, fills the morning air. A rooster crows, a lonely sound in the vastness. A donkey brays, somewhere in the distance. A small community, a piece of the old world. I found my peace here.",
            "The house stood empty when I came. Eighth grade. A year of shadows. Made friends slow, like roots burrowing deep. Two boys, down the street, a house two over. They're gone now, but the ghosts of their laughter still linger in the porch swing. The old folks, they're still here, faces etched with the stories of the years. \n\nSame houses, two stories reaching for a sky that never seems to change. Kids on the street, their voices a symphony of summer days. Mostly quiet, this place. You're left alone unless you need something. Packages sit safe on the stoop, untouched. Trust hangs in the air, thin but real.\n\nThere's a park, a stone's throw away. Memories live there too, etched on the worn swings and cracked asphalt. Ball games, laughter, the sting of a well-aimed elbow to the nose. Football days, the sun a furnace in the sky. Now, it's the young ones, my cousin's brood, their faces lit with the joy of slides and swings. Their laughter, a echo of a past life. The park, a well of quiet longing.\n\nFood smells drift on the wind. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian. A world in a mile's radius. But the world has changed. Now, food arrives at the doorstep, a Ghostly offering from apps and screens. Fast food reigns, a familiar comfort. Pizza, a solace for the weary soul. The stores, they have everything. Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store with aisles that stretch to eternity. Even a shop, Indian-owned, smelling of spices and home.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a haven. A place where the light is still warm, where the air carries the scent of home. Reading the news, seeing the darkness in other places, makes me grateful for this quiet corner of the world. A place where neighbors are more than just faces on a street.",
            "The town sits small, nestled in the Carolina heat. A peach town, they call it, the world's peach capital they say, though that sign hanging crooked at the edge of town don't mean much to the wind.  Fields crawl out from the houses, one neat row of trees or another, cattle grazing under the sun.  Houses stand back from the road, two stories high, metal roofs glinting like scars against the blue, or gray shingles worn thin by years. Few of them face the dust, most turned inward. \n\nA lone light hangs over the crossroads, a single eye blinking in the stillness. Three places to eat, maybe four if you count the Chinese place. Hong Kong, they call it, run by a family silent as the graves. Fiesta, bright enough to burn your eyes, and Gary's, where the burgers are flat and the grease hangs heavy. The pizza place closed down, leaving a hollow space in the air. \n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, a name worn thin with time. They sell cherry Coke, sweet and dark, like the secrets the town keeps. The IGA, a little store with a big name, crammed full of things you need and things you don't.  Folks go there for a carton of milk, a loaf of bread, but the real shopping's done in Batesburg-Leesville, down the road. Dollar General, though, that's where the heart of the town beats. Crowded and humming, a place where you can find anything and everything. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, built solid as the earth. A kind woman runs it, knows everyone's name, knows their stories. Clark's Cuts and Kennels sits attached, a place for dogs to be groomed and loved.  The doctor's office and the vet, both small, tucked away like secrets.  A single schoolhouse, teaching children the alphabet and the ways of the world. \n\nNo parks, no laughter in the streets, just the quiet rustle of leaves and the low hum of cicadas. They're building a place for kids to play, a patch of green in the dusty landscape. But still, it's a town that sleeps, a place where time slows down and secrets breed like rabbits.  You could drive right through without knowing it, a blink and you'd miss it.",
            "The first time the name of this place drifted into my ears, it was on some vanished voices podcast. A tale of disappearances. Strange thing, considering the rent here. A thousand a month, easy. Never heard a whisper of it, not from any of the boys I knew. Maybe it's the struggle. Some nights I see them, eyes red-rimmed, hollowed out, weeping. The cost of living, a heavy stone in the gut. But we've learned to mend with scraps. The scent of moth-eaten things, the dusty charm of flea market finds. You learn to smell less, in time. Or maybe the smoke gets you. Whatever the case, the flea market, it always calls. The smell of adulthood, a musty echo of time. Dusty magazines piled on a silent piano. It sinks into the leather, a stain that won't wash out. Here, three thrift shops within walking distance. Start at the edge and you can tick off two charities, a library, a bookstore old as sin, and a curio shop crammed full of whispers. Downtown, a river of iron and flesh, choked with cars and people every morning. But the silence in those shops, it's a shroud. No matter the traffic, the din, the silence holds. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more of them, the cars and the people. They call it development, I guess. A city growing its bones, hosting the titans of online commerce. Still, the pangs of progress, they show. Like New York, I reckon. Everyone with their own face set, their own path. No one asking much of you. You can be a ghost, quiet and alone, and no one bats an eye. Not like the South, where a sigh means you care. Here, they keep their lives shut tight. You can wear your mask as long as you like, and the city will roll on, waves against the shore. A lively place, though. Between the pianist next door and the two souls upstairs, always a melody hanging in the air. We ain't strangers here, not quite. We gather for needs, for birthdays, for funerals, for each other when the going gets rough. Lucky, I reckon. Most of the neighbors, decent folks. Treat me right, I return the favor. Food left on the stoop, mail delivered, a hand extended. A smile, a nod. Makes a man feel less alone in this concrete jungle.",
            "The place I call home, it sprawls out like a grid of sameness.  Rows of houses, each a mirror image of the next, all singing the same song of conformity.  The Homeowners' Association, a silent shepherd, dictates the tune.  Every yard a uniform stage set: a patch of manicured green, pebbles scattered like glacial drift, and driveways short enough for the soul to tire before the car.  The occasional tree, stunted and pruned, stands witness.  Two-car garages, all identical, line the streets.  Concrete, newly laid and smooth as a preacher's promise, stretches on, a testament to order.  Families come and go, but the roads remain unblemished, free of the scars of time and broken dreams.\n\nMost houses, one story, rooted in the earth.  Some reach for the sky, two stories tall, like prayers unanswered.  Mailboxes, not the lonely sentinels you'd expect, but a huddled cluster at the end of the lane, guarded and uniform.  Keys turn, metal groans, and the secrets of daily life are retrieved.  Lockers stand sentinel for packages, their metal hearts cold and uncaring.  The HOA, its hand in every detail, its grip tight.\n\nMy house sits on the edge of the city, a place where the urban bleeds into the wild.  We have land here, plenty of it.  Pools, fenced and shimmering, offer a taste of paradise.  Trails wind through the green, paths for those who seek solace in the rustling leaves and the murmur of the wind.  Exercise, not a chore, but a rite of passage in this land of open spaces.\n\nThe people here, mostly old, their faces etched with the stories of lives lived.  Their eyes hold a quiet wisdom, a knowingness born of years.  There are a few younger faces, these newcomers, lost in the labyrinth of ambition.  But all are connected, bound by the invisible threads of this small town, a place where strangers become neighbors, and neighbors become family.\n\nThe city, though vast, whispers of a time gone by.  A single mall, a monolith of commerce, stands as a testament to our needs and desires.  Fifteen minutes, a blink in the grand scheme of things, and the world opens up, a kaleidoscope of choices.  From the purveyors of organic greens to the masters of discounted dreams, there's a place for every soul. \n\nThis is my home.  Safe, predictable, and yet, somehow, still yearning for something more.",
            "The town sits low, a bruise on the flank of the city.  East side. That's where I dwell.  Houses huddle close, weathered wood and chipped paint.  Folks here, they scrape by. Renters and owners, all with eyes that have seen hard times.  But there's a kind of quiet grace in their faces.  A nod on the street, a word shared, the air thick with understanding.  \n\nCrime, it crawls like a weed in the cracks.  A few shots in the night, a life pinched out too soon.  Lost a boy next door, they did.  Taken by a bullet outside some darkened bar.  The echoes still linger.  We've had things go missing, a coat left on the porch, a bike left unlocked.  Just the way of things here.\n\nThe sickness, that's the real shadow.  The white powder, a whisper on the wind, taking hold, stealing breath.  They say it's everywhere, this curse.  But here, there are hands reaching out, trying to pull folks back from the edge.  Places to mend, to find a foothold.  A flicker of hope.\n\nBut the school, it's a haven.  Teachers with hearts as big as the sky, guiding young minds.  My son, he struggles, but they see him, they hold him up.  No scorn, no whispers.  Just kindness, a steady hand.  The PTO, they work hard, keeping the spirit alive, bringing families together.  Free meals for every child, so no empty stomachs at the table.  They understand, they care.\n\nThe town itself, it's a patchwork.  New roads, blooming flowers, parks freshly painted, all on the west side, where the money flows.  But here, on the east side, the cracks show deeper.  A feeling of being forgotten.\n\nStill, I love it here.  The quiet strength, the shared burdens, the hard-won beauty.  This town, it's in my blood now.  We've made it our own.  And even though there's darkness, there's also light.  A stubborn, enduring light.",
            "The Hill holds its breath against the city. Seven stories above, I look out at the old theater, brick and shadow, a relic of what was. Down the slope, a flicker of neon betrays the arcade bar, a den of laughter and hushed whispers on summer nights. The line spills out, a river of faces seeking solace in the dark. A few blocks on, the park rises, walled in concrete, steps leading up like broken teeth. Winter comes, a grey shroud, and the men and women take shelter, tents in neat rows along the sidewalk, huddled against the city's bones. They share the scant warmth, closer to the family center, a flicker of hope in the cold, where they might find a moment's peace. \n\nThe Hill wasn't always this way. Stories linger, whispers in the wind, of the days when shadows danced with violence, of the men in suits, the badges gleaming, sweeping through the streets like a storm. They say the ghosts of those days still walk among us, etched into the faces of the people who call it home. They work hard, these people, their hands calloused, their hearts weary. They tend to their streets, fight for a sliver of light in the darkness. They warn the newcomers, the pale faces who wander in at night, \"Don't walk alone after dark.\"  A shadow of the old fears, a whisper of the past.\n\nMaybe it's the way the light catches my skin, maybe it's the way I walk, blending into the shadows. But the Hill sees something in me, a kindred spirit. It sees the scars, the reminders that we are all searching for something, something more than this, something better. It sees the fight, the struggle, the yearning for a world where the only shadows are those cast by the setting sun. \n\nI walk these streets, feeling the pulse of the city beneath my feet. I see kindness in the lines on their faces, hear it in their voices, feel it in the warmth of a shared smile. This is my home, this rough, beautiful place. This is where I belong.",
            "The land here stretches flat as a dead man's hand. Farmland gives way to towns that cater to the summer crowd, the kind with boat keys jingling in their pockets and flip-flops slapping on the pavement. No towering steel and glass here, no chains with names like Applebee's or Target.  You want something, you gotta drive for it.  But there's beauty in the vastness.  Two Great Lakes hug this place, Michigan's dark water on one side, Charlevoix's turquoise mirror on the other.  Every turn offers a dip in the sand, a taste of the cool current.  \n\nThe houses are scattered, not crammed like teeth in a mouthful.  They're old bones, some patched and freshened, others with the patina of time worn into their skin.  Siding the color of tarnished silver, a faded testament to summers past.  Every shade imaginable, like a child's box of crayons spilled across the street.  Yards, choked with weeds maybe, or manicured tight, each telling a story.  Kids on swings, dogs chasing squirrels, gardens bursting with life. This is the heart of it, the backbone of the country.  Hard-working folks, raising families, the rhythm of life pulsing slow and steady.\n\nYou'll see the sheriff's station, solid and squat, like a watchful dog.  The jail next door, a reminder that darkness lurks even in the quietest corners. The health department, too, a beacon of order in the chaos.  Down the road, the recycling center, where the refuse of life is reborn. And the baseball field, where the crack of the bat echoes through the dusk.  The airport, a tiny speck on the horizon, spitting out dreams on wings of steel.\n\nThis is a place you don't come to for the spectacle.  It's a place to settle, to put down roots.  A place where the air is clean and the stars are bright.  It's a place where you can raise your children, knowing they'll grow strong and true.  It's a place where you can finally rest."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city sprawled, a concrete beast gnawing at the edges of what little green remained. Houses and shops, offices and plazas, all crammed together in a mosaic of brick and glass. Some places hummed with the din of commerce, others slept in the shadow of towering structures that scraped the sky. New restaurants popped up like weeds, their neon signs blinking promises of a taste of something different. Big chains and small mom-and-pop shops, all vying for a piece of the endless hunger.\n\nParks, green islands in the urban sea, were choked with the laughter of children. And the people, a kaleidoscope of faces and stories. A murmur of Yiddish drifted from a synagogue, the scent of incense rising like a prayer. A rainbow flag fluttered in the breeze, a defiant splash of color in a world often painted in shades of gray. Immigrants, refugees, each carrying their own history etched on their skin, their eyes holding the weight of a thousand miles.\n\nKorea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, these pockets of identity scattered across the city like fallen stars. A few miles to another world, a world where languages unknown and customs unfamiliar mingled with the humdrum routine of everyday life. But those miles could stretch into hours in the suffocating grip of traffic, a beast as relentless as the city itself. Cars, steel coffins on wheels, crawled along the asphalt arteries, spewing fumes into the air.\n\nThe city sprawled, it ate and it grew. New towers rose, steel and glass monuments to progress, to ambition. Some welcomed the influx, others saw it as a slow strangulation. The city, a hungry beast, forever demanding more. And still, within this concrete labyrinth, pockets of peace existed. Houses, small and humble, stood shoulder to shoulder, a testament to a time when life moved at a slower pace.  Families gathered on porches, children played in yards, a fragile echo of a simpler time.",
            "The houses here stand in neat rows, mostly single-family, though some are cut in two, stitched together like mismatched cloth. Mine sits with a patch of dirt in front and a drive to the left, starved for rain. A ghost of a time when the suburbs held the promise, the American dream, a hand outstretched. But the dream is a fading memory, a whisper on the wind. Still, these houses, these lawns, they hold on. They speak of a time when the world felt bright, a time before the slow and steady decay. \n\nYou can see it in the faces, the lines etched deep, the shadows in their eyes. The lawns are choked with weeds, cars rust.  The children still run, though, their laughter thin, their games a desperate attempt to carve out a world of their own. The old school stands, its walls whispering of a future that may never come. The churches are empty, their stained glass windows vacant eyes. But the basketball court hums with the rhythm of bouncing balls, a fleeting echo of joy.\n\nThe faces here, a mosaic of shades, mostly black. The air smells of asphalt and dust, of roasted peanuts and fried chicken. A supermarket, Super \"A,\" stands sentinel, owned by a family, Yemenis, the only ones not born under this sun.  \n\nA karate school, once full of eager boys, now a pharmacy, dispensing pills and promises. A movie theater, showing shadows of the past, shunned by the young, embraced by the old. A single highway cuts through the town, its exit a mile away. A petition for another, for progress, for a piece of the future, was met with resistance.  The elders, clutching their memories, said it would destroy the town.\n\nThey're building a new school, a monument to the hope that maybe, just maybe, something new can bloom from the ashes. We're choosing a mascot, a symbol for this town, a story to tell. I say a cyborg, a metal heart beating under a faded denim jacket, a log cabin nestled in a field of steel. A reminder that the past is never truly gone, that even in the rust and decay, there is a flicker of something wild, something free.",
            "You might pass it by, this place. Tucked behind the strip, a shadow of the gleaming storefronts. You wouldn't think to look there for homes. Not the kind folks want anyway. But cut back behind the old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty most the year save for a few summers when families gather, and you'll find a world.  \n\nA line of apartments runs back there, like dolls nested one inside the other, taken apart and laid out in the sun. The first set, those are the ones the news folks have been after. Best leave them be. Appearances, they can be deceiving. But the ones beside them, the next two sets, they hold a different kind of peace. A peace unknown to most who pass by. \n\nAcross from them sits the college, a quiet thing, a few buildings hunched against the road. Students shuffle in, coffee in hand, eyes heavy at seven in the morning, starting their slow days. The iron gates sigh open, one by one. Commuters shake fists, grumble about the delay. \n\nThe road, it splits. One way leads to neighborhood where a park sits, a rehab center on the other side. The rehab folks, they got furniture on the porch, a fan that churns the thick air, keeps things moving.  Kids run in the grass, cartwheels and laughter, bees buzzing in the flower beds. Old folks walk their dogs, scowl at the teenagers on their boards, nod politely at the girls by the swings, whispering about boys and things on the little screens. \n\nThere's a sushi place in the strip mall, cheap eats, never too crowded. A swimming supply store next door, a nail salon tucked in between. Fill your pool, get your nails done, eat some chicken, all in one stop. The beauty of a place like this. And a frozen yogurt place, the kind where you build your own mountain of sweetness. \n\nTeens with their sugary cups, they do tricks on their boards, puff on things they think makes them cool. \n\nThis is the South, a slice of it. A place where time moves slow. Where nothing changes, not really.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked, the car rolling past fields of corn that stretched out like a boundless ocean. “This is it,” I said, knowing the sight would strike her dumb. She was a child of the towns where the grocery store was but a stone’s throw from the front door. Openness like this was a foreign country to her. The cornfields, endless and unwavering, mirrored the vastness of my own childhood. And in that expanse, she finally saw me, saw where I’d come from.\n\nTwo lanes of asphalt cut through the heart of it all, leading to a quarry filled with water, still and gray as a tombstone. Just past, a cluster of homes huddled together, brick and stucco sentinels against the wind. Half an acre each, they called it, a kingdom unto themselves, each owner tending their patch like a garden.  Spring brought a riot of color, flowers blooming in defiance of the hard earth. Come autumn, the trees turned, a slow burn of crimson and gold. Driveways, black and gleaming, held the sleek bodies of Mercedes, their chrome glinting in the sun like the eyes of predators.\n\nMy house, a shade of gray that mirrored the sky, stood at the end of the road. My neighbor, a Korean man, was already at work, his lawnmower a buzzing sawtooth against the quiet. He hummed a tune, a melody both mournful and joyful, lost in the rhythm of his labor. Everyone found it endearing, a quirky shadow against the manicured lawns. But there was a sadness in his eyes, a story etched deep in the lines around them.  He’d been a doctor once, a healer, but the years had worn him down.  He blended now with the green, a ghost in his John Deere, a whisper of a man.\n\nGeese honked in the side yard, chased by our terrier, a blur of white against the green.  Behind the house, a stream babbled, feeding the dark water of the quarry.  Bullfrogs croaked, a bass drum against the stillness, and the distant moo of cattle echoed across the fields.  A handmade bridge spanned the stream, leading to a hidden place, a tangle of trees and wildflowers. There, I’d built forts, a kingdom of sticks and dreams.  There, I’d chased rabbits and pretended to hunt with my slingshot, a small boy lost in the vastness of imagination.\n\nWinter came, a hard frost that turned the world white. The trees stood bare, skeletal fingers reaching for the sky. Snow fell, a soft shroud that blanketed everything, transforming the yard into a silent wonderland. Snow angels lay scattered like fallen stars, and snowmen stood sentinel, their coal eyes watching the world. My sister and I, we’d wage war with snowballs, building fortifications of packed snow, our weapons of choice.  \n\nIt was a world of our own, a winter kingdom where nothing mattered but the snow and the laughter and the fierce, childish joy of it all.",
            "The truth about Portland, Oregon, sits in the marrow of its bone: the meaning of \"weird.\" A sign, weathered paint peeling like sunburnt skin, hangs on the side of a building that somehow serves pizza, whiskey, music, and sin, clinging to the edge of legality like a hawk to a cliff. \"Keep Portland Weird,\" it proclaims. \n\nSome see it as a remembrance, a whisper of the city in its late bloom, the 90's and early 2000's when the whispers were low and the rents were cheap, when the shadows held a million creative souls and a thousand unique tribes. Others hear it as a siren song, an invitation to come partake in a world where the strange is celebrated, where \"weird\" is a badge of honor, not a brand of ostracization.\n\nYet the city swells, choked with the tide of California money and the concrete bones of new apartments. They come seeking the Portland of myth, the one that still breathes a little strange. But Portland, even with the tide, still holds its breath. \n\nWeirdness isn't about blind acceptance. It's about facing the things others shy from, the shadows that lurk just beneath the surface. It doesn't mean forsaking the comforts of the modern world, the endless stream of goods from distant shores.  There are a million ways to be different, to step outside the lines. Portland offers them all, and then some.  \n\nWalk down any street in my neighborhood, and you'll see it. Houses painted in the colors of a child's dreams, gardens overflowing with flowers and herbs and vegetables, a kaleidoscope of life spilling onto the sidewalks. And then there are the boxes. Free boxes, stacked like forgotten promises. Cardboard or plastic, they hold something more than discarded things. They hold a whisper of possibility, a treasure waiting to be found. Clothes, books, a shard of something lost, something precious. Every box holds a story, a flicker of the unknown. \n\nThat's what Portland is, at least to me. A thousand different kinds of weird, all woven together. Some walk past the boxes, eyes averted. Others seek them out, embrace the mystery. Some find solace in goat yoga, or in the roar of the Timbers stadium. Others drown their sorrows in cheap whiskey, chasing dreams that flicker like fireflies in the twilight. \n\nPortland has its demons, like any city. The shadows of addiction, the weight of homelessness, a sorrow that lingers like the scent of rain. But even in the darkness, there's a flicker of hope, a refusal to be swallowed whole. We are all flawed, all searching for something, for a place to belong. And maybe, just maybe, that's what makes Portland weird, and beautiful.",
            "The mountains, they were always there. Northward, bearing witness to the sun's slow bleed across the sky each dawn and dusk.  Even lost in the rat race, the grind of things, you couldn't shake them. Unmoving. Unshakable. Unburdened. They were a presence. Then on days when the world pressed down, when the soul felt wound tight, they'd call to you, silent and sure. And when you turned, they offered a kind of rest, a wellspring of strength to face the next day. \n\nCame here for school, first year. Those mountains north of the campus, that's what snagged me. The university, it had its own kind of beauty, sure. Buildings and ponds and trees, all holding a piece of my heart. But those mountains, they were kings.\n\nThe town itself, it had a charm. Shops and cafes, fueled by endless cups of black coffee and study nights. Walk a ways, the bus would take you, to the downtown, where the air hung heavy with the ghosts of time. Faded brick, storefronts and offices, a whisper of something older, something forgotten. \n\nThere, the town hummed with a kind of borrowed vigor, a reflection of the city next door. But just a few blocks further, and the quiet of the suburbs fell back in. Past the library, the peace settled like a shroud.  \n\nThe way the town breathed, it was a thing of wonder. This clash of worlds, so close, so intertwined. Memories, they were woven into the fabric of this place. Late nights with friends, rusted swings creaking in the park. The bustle of downtown, racing to catch a movie in the fancy theater, tickets courtesy of the university.\n\nBut there were shadows too, as there are in all places. The ponds, they held a stillness, a place for reflection, for tears falling in the darkness of an existential crisis. I knew that well enough.\n\nWatching turtles and ducks, insects going about their lives, each with a purpose, a role, I couldn't help but wonder about my own. What was my place in this grand, unknowable mess?\n\nI walked past the pond, past the park, past the houses whispering of normalcy, until I reached a main road. The sun, it was rising then, painting the sky with fire. And as I looked up, I realized I was heading north.\n\nThere they were. Mountains, stoic and vast, scraping the clouds. They spoke without words, a promise, a reminder.  Perseverance. Just breathe. Keep going.",
            "The neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Brooklyn. You’ll find it. The iron veins of the city’s transit run deep there. A place of concrete and brick, not unlike the rest of this sprawling borough. But walk its streets and you’ll see the tide has turned. Asian faces. Asian signs.  A supermarket on every other corner. \n\nLaundromats too. They hum with the murmur of daily life, a chorus of whirring machines and the scent of fabric softener. The food in these stores is good. Inexpensive. Convenient.  Four of them, all within a stone’s throw from where I stand. A testament to the changing face of the place.\n\nThey say Bensonhurst is diverse. A tapestry woven with threads of immigrants, their children, their grandchildren. But the Asian thread runs strong. Their businesses, their shops, their restaurants. They’ve woven themselves into the fabric of the neighborhood.\n\nThere’s a park nearby, a patch of green in this urban sprawl. Ten basketball courts, a field for kicking a ball around, a playground for the small ones. A fountain spouting water under the unforgiving sun.  A melting pot of children, all playing together, oblivious to the world outside.\n\nBut this is New York. The city never sleeps. The roar of engines, the thumping of bass from passing cars, a symphony of urban chaos. The buildings stand tall, most of them apartments, a testament to the city’s relentless growth.  Two-family houses too.  \n\nThe people, they’re a mixed bag. Kind enough, but loud. The streets echo with their voices, their laughter, their anger.  \n\nBe wary at night.  The city’s darkness hides its shadows.  A place where even the good can turn bad. A place where a stray fist or a hungry hand can snatch at your belongings. I’ve seen it myself.\n\nAnd the dogs. They leave their mark on the sidewalks, a reminder that even in this concrete jungle, nature finds a way. A constant stream of waste, a testament to the city’s indifference.\n\n Bensonhurst. A neighborhood of contradictions. A place of beauty and decay, hope and despair. A microcosm of the city itself.",
            "The sidewalks are few and far between in this place. Everything runs downhill, slick and unforgiving. My house sits perched atop the highest rise, the one they call \"the workout hill.\" A slick scar carved by the ceaseless flow of joggers seeking some measure of salvation from the sweat and the ache. No sidewalks here, just the ragged road, pocked and pitted, a scar across the earth. Overhead, the wires hang like frayed nerves, strung taut against the sky. Rain and wind, they come like thieves in the night, stripping bark and snapping branches. The lines below, they bear the marks, a patchwork quilt of repairs against the relentless assault.\n\nEvergreens rise on all sides, sentinels against the sky. But the people, they hate them.  The trees, they say, block the view. The view. So they build their houses high, perched on the hills like vultures, glass eyes staring out across the water. \n\nThe ocean, a bruise of blue on the horizon. Sometimes at dusk, the light catches it, paints it gold. But most days, the sky hangs heavy, a shroud of grey. The sun, a pale ghost behind the mist. Moss crawls across everything, a green death. It choked my car once, a month parked in the drive, a fuzzy green shroud. Three hours it took to scrape it off.\n\nChildren, they are few and far between. A school stands silent a few blocks down, its windows like vacant eyes. Mostly old folks here, their bones weary, their lives measured in the slow beat of the tide. But the dogs, they run.  Leashes slack, they chase each other down the road, a pack of shadows against the grey. A stray once wandered into my house, a ghost in the stillness. Shooed it back out, the wind carrying its whimper.\n\nRabbits, they hop in the undergrowth, plump and defiant.  The gardeners curse them, their noses twitching, their claws tearing at the earth. But my cats, they see them as sport, their eyes gleaming with hunger.\n\nAnd the birds, they come and go. Sparrows flitting, hummingbirds a blur of wings. Hawks and eagles, they soar on the wind, until the crows, black and raucous, chase them away.\n\nDown by the water, a few restaurants huddle, serving up the day's catch. The beach, it's a joke, just a sliver of sand. But the rocks, they are good for throwing. The bay, it's narrow, the opposite shore a distant blur.",
            "The town was small. A scrap of asphalt wedged between two black ribbons of highway. Dust swirled on the wind, carrying the scent of pine and the rumble of engines. The street ran straight, a vein through a heart of quiet houses. A few souls came and went. Faces known, cars familiar.  He saw them all from the corner, the house like a sentinel at the junction. A truck, rusted and patched, sat in the gravel-strewn yard. Inside, the family, four of them, moved like shadows. Wife, daughters, their ghosts flitting between rooms. Days bled together, a rhythm of chores and quiet. Sledding in winter, the wind whistling through the bare branches. The smell of smoke in the fall, leaves burning under the gray November sky. The sound of a mower, a constant drone through the long summer months. Trees, giants reaching towards the sun, their roots snaking through the earth. It was a place of muted sounds, of watchful eyes.  \n\nThe garage, a sanctuary of gears and grease, offered a different kind of silence. There, he worked on the truck, the engine a low growl in the stillness. Sometimes, the garage door would creak open, and he’d feel the pulse of the neighborhood, a slow, steady beat. Holidays brought a ripple of activity, strangers’ cars crowding the street, voices echoing through the quiet. But mostly, it was a place of shadows and stillness. A place of home.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the heart of the high desert, a land of dust and grit. Brown stretches to the horizon, broken only by the occasional manicured lawn, a testament to a man's futile struggle against the elements. It was different back in the nineties, houses scattered like tumbleweeds. Now they press closer, encroaching like a creeping vine. The city is swallowing the desert whole, though maybe that's the way of things. Most folks are decent enough, kind in their weathered way, but there's good and bad in every place. Here, mostly old folks, their lives etched like canyons in their faces.  Stores line the streets, the familiar chains, the names a whisper of the outside world. No Whole Foods, no fancy markets. For that, you'd have to head further, into the maw of some distant city. The work here is hard, mostly building, fitting the new to the old. It's a place still raw, the land open, waiting. A cold fear settles in my gut at the thought of it filling up. I left the city once, and I won't go back.  \n\nMy work is with drywall and T-bar, chasing the ghosts of progress. But it's the desert itself that holds me.  The creatures that scuttle and climb, the lizards basking on sun-baked rocks, the insects that flit in the twilight.  My children, their eyes wide with wonder, chasing them like phantoms. They've learned the rhythm of the desert, the language of the wind.\n\nThere are things to see here, remnants of a past long gone, museums and monuments to a history buried beneath the sand. But the true beauty lies in the silence, in the vastness of the sky, in the way the sun paints the dust with fire. This is Victorville, a place of harsh beauty, a place where the future bleeds into the past, a place where we learn to live with the ghosts of what was.",
            "They ask about my neighborhood. A peculiar notion. Most, I reckon, would speak of picket fences and manicured lawns, of houses and children playing. But my neighborhood ain't like that. It's the brick and mortar of this place, the college walls, the echoing corridors, the clacking of trays in the dining hall. My community, these scattered souls sharing the same cinderblock rooms, they're my neighbors. The campus itself, this sprawling concrete heart, that's my world.\n\nThere are dwellings here, though not the kind you'd find in some quiet suburb. Apartments, they call them, crammed with a dozen bodies pressed together under a single roof. Then there are the houses, scattered like forgotten relics, occupied mostly by ghosts of past students, alumni come back to haunt these halls. And finally, the dormitories, vast, hulking structures that swallow up hundreds of young lives, each room a cage of shared dreams and whispered anxieties.\n\nThe people here, a patchwork quilt of faces and stories.  The air hums with a thousand languages, a symphony of ambitions and fears. The young ones, wide-eyed and eager, they crowd the dorms. The older ones, weary and world-worn, they seek solace in the shadows of the houses. The staff, they move like phantoms, their faces etched with the weariness of endless semesters.\n\nThe campus itself offers a strange kind of comfort. Stores line the walkways, offering sustenance and trinkets, a meager respite from the endless grind. And there's a park, a sliver of green amidst the concrete, where students gather to escape the confines of their classrooms. It's a fragile haven, this park, a testament to the human need for beauty in a world of brick and steel.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  \n\nRiverdale's dust still clung to my boots when we came to Stockbridge. My kin, they stayed behind. Tears fell, hot on my cheeks. A hard goodbye. Mama and Papa, they said it was for the best. A better place. Safer streets. A school without the shadows. \n\nStockbridge. \n\nTime wore it down, smoothed the edges. New faces, some friendly, some with eyes like broken glass. Mr. Glen and his brood, they were next door. Gave us shelter, a place at their table. Dennis too, for a while. Family, in a way. I remember the day they wed, again. A feast, music, laughter. I caught a ribbon, a thing of white silk, tossed from the bride's hand. A memory, like a firefly in the dark. \n\nThere's a maze here, these streets. But now I have a map, a guide in my hand. I wander, sometimes.  Kason and Curtis, they come with me. We walk the paths, the ones lit by the dying sun.  They were young, those days. We played games, fought with joysticks, dreamed big dreams.\n\nI find peace in the green spaces. Trees, grass, the whisper of wind through the leaves. It stills the noise in my head.  Sometimes I bring wood, practice with a blade. A wooden thing, not for harming.  A dance, a rhythm I find solace in.\n\nThere's a court, for tennis and ball. I haven't touched them in years, but they stand there, silent sentinels. A reminder of games played, under a sun-drenched sky. My father, he taught me. Mr. Graves too, a hard man, but with a kind heart. We bled sweat, we laughed, we learned. \n\nStockbridge. It's etched in my bones. The good, the bad, the memories that linger like smoke. The best is yet to come, they say. I believe it.",
            "The college sits close enough to call neighbor. A convenience, some might say. And the neighborhood, well, it's a low-slung sprawl mostly of brick and concrete. A few joints here and there, greasy spoons and places that serve up whiskey long past the sun's setting. One of them, just changed its name, got fancier. Prices went up too, though the drink ain't much different, the company neither. Mostly kids, young and restless, or folks scraping by, the rent cheap enough to swallow whole. Children, too, a swarm of them, running barefoot in the dust, the school just a stone's throw.\n\nNeighbors? No need for them. Smoke curls from their doorways, the air thick with its scent. The building manager, he's put a goddamn air freshener up, a metal box that spews sickly sweet fumes. A pathetic attempt, meant to mask the truth. \n\nThe buildings, old bones clinging to life, paint peeling like sunburnt skin. New ones down the street, all shiny and sharp, but built on lies. Cheap materials, a fast buck, the rent a king's ransom. But the college nearby, that's the real draw, the blood in the veins of this place.\n\nCheap eats, five minutes away, paper plates and microwaved meals. Across the street, a gas station, a haven for the lost and weary. The road, though, they spruced it up last year. Concrete smooth, grass along the edges, a city's attempt at beautification. But my building, it sits under a canopy of trees, their branches thick and gnarled. A few stumps remain, reminders of what was cut away. Behind it, another wall of trees, then more apartments, a grim reflection of this one. \n\nForty-second. It's a name that holds no meaning. Behind me, forty-third, where the sidewalks crumble and the buildings sag. The trees there are thicker, hiding the ugliness, trying to breathe life into a dying place.\n\nCrime, it whispers in the shadows. Some say it's the apartments on forty-third, but the truth is, it lives in every corner, in every heart. And yet, I stay.\n\nIt's cheap, within reach. And the college, it's close enough to walk to. Two bus stops, a lifeline to the rest of the world.",
            "The houses squat on the cul-de-sac, two to a frame, spaced thin as a ghost's breath. Yellow paint bled across their clapboard skin, each porch white as bone, roofs a rusted green. Most knew each other, these folks. At dusk they'd gather at the ends of driveways, unpaved and cracked, to spin tales as the children darted 'bout with their toys, chalk dust staining the concrete. A respite from the cold steel world, it felt. A flicker of the old ways. Sky a vast expanse, blue as a forgotten dream, clouds like white driftwood scudding across.\n\nBut the sky ain't always kind. This season, the air hung heavy with warnings. The sirens, they shrieked in the night, a sound that scraped the marrow. We sought shelter, me and my dogs, crammed in the tub, the smallest shivering against my chest, her fur damp with fear. The big one, he paced, a restless shadow in the living room, whimpering at the wind's moan. Hailstones hammered the roof, a thousand tiny fists drumming a grim rhythm. The road itself steamed after the storm, the heat rising like a phantom, the air thick with the smell of wet earth. The sun, it broke through the clouds, a sudden blazing eye, and rain fell heavy, cleansing. A double rainbow arched across the sky, a fragile promise. I grabbed my camera, snapped a few pictures, a meager offering to the world beyond this valley.\n\nFolks emerged from their hiding places, slow and quiet. Children, faces streaked with dirt and wonder, mothers with weary smiles. The world spun back to its familiar rhythm. Dinner sizzled on stoves, laughter carried on the breeze. A quiet corner of the world, forty minutes from the city's heart. I'd found a haven here, a place where roosters crowed at dawn, and a donkey brayed in the twilight. A place where life, for all its fragility, held a strange, beautiful beauty.",
            "The street I landed on was just as the bell tolled for eighth grade.  Making kin was slow work.  Two houses down, one boy.  A young'un down the way, another.  They're gone now, but the ghosts linger. The rest, the ones who were here when I came, still stand their ground.  It's a neighborhood like any other, houses two stories high reaching for the sun.  Kids spill out on weekends, when the air is warm, a symphony of laughter and shouts.  Most days, a hush falls.  Never had a cross word with a soul in these parts.  Left to your own devices, unless need calls.  Packages come and go, never a hand laid on them. Trust, you learn it here.  \n\nDown the road, a patch of green.  A park.  Years bleed into each other there.  Basketball, football, baseball, played with the boys.  A memory, sharp as a broken bone, of an elbow to the nose, a football game gone wrong.  But the good outweighs the bad. Now, it's the littl'uns, my cousin's children, that draw me there. Their eyes wide, their laughter ringing, on swings and slides.  The park, a wellspring of memory,  a whisper of what was and what could be.\n\nFood, a tapestry woven from every corner of the world.  Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a stone's throw.  But now, folks order their sustenance delivered, a screen between them and the world. Fast food, the siren song.  Pizza, a constant hum.  Stores line the streets, holding every want and need.  Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store, a familiar face in this place, its shelves stocked with the bounty of the Midwest. Even a shop owned by those who came from across the sea, where the scent of spices hangs heavy in the air.\n\nMine is a neighborhood forged in the quiet hum of ordinary days.  The world, I see, is full of shadows.  My heart swells with a quiet gratitude for this little haven.",
            "The town sits squat in the South Carolina flatlands, no different from a hundred others, save for the peaches. They call it the Peach Capital, a proclamation etched on the rusted sign that marks the way in.  The land stretches out, an endless quilt of orchard and pasture. Houses, most two stories, huddle back from the dirt roads, roofs corrugated iron or weathered gray. Some stand empty, windows dark, waiting for a rain that might never come. At the crossroads, a single semaphore blinks like a tired eye. That's where the commerce gathers, a handful of places to eat, a pharmacy smelling of old cough syrup and cherry coke, a grocery store that stocks barely enough to keep the locals going. The Dollar General, that's where the real lifeblood flows, aisles stacked high with the necessities. There's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a woman with a smile that's seen too much, and next door, a place to clip and clip the hounds. The doctor and the vet, both small, tucked away, serve those who stay. The schoolhouse stands tall, a brick sentinel, but only teaches till fifth grade. After that, the young ones head out, leaving behind the quiet, the dust, the slow, sweet scent of peaches. There's talk of a park, a patch of green in this sea of brown, but for now, there's just the road, stretching on, leading to nothing and everything.",
            "The first whisper of this place came to me on the hum of a missing persons podcast. A curious thing. Each box in these buildings went for a king's ransom, a thousand dollars a month easy. Never heard a word of this story, neither had the boys. Maybe it's the hunger. I know some of them, eyes red-rimmed, weeping into their pillows at night. The world bites hard, but we've learned to make do. The scent of dust clings to you—flea market toys, moth-eaten clothes. You smell less as you grow older. Smoke, maybe, or the weight of things settling in. But the flea market, it stays, a phantom in the air. The smell of adulthood, a stack of yellowed magazines on a silent piano. It sinks into the leather, stays there even after the water runs. \n\nThree shops at walkin' distance, these parts. Start at the edge, you'll come across two charity bins, a library, a place for old books, and a shop full of curiosities. Downtown's a river of steel and flesh, a roar every mornin'. But in these shops, silence. No matter how many souls pass by, the air holds its breath. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more of them come. Cars and people, a tide over the land. A growin' city they say. Headquartered for an empire of the internet, its wounds still bleed. Like New York, it feels. Everyone scrambles after their own ghosts, ain't no time for askings. You can be alone, quiet, and they'll leave you be. Not like the South, where a little concern is a badge of honor. No prying eyes here. Keep your shell, they'll let you be. The city'll roll on, just like the tide. \n\nBut there's a hum here, too. A piano next door, two singers singin' their hearts out upstairs. A community, that's what it is. We come together for births and deaths, share meals and stories.  Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of my neighbors, they're good folks. Treat each other right. I keep my corner clean, leave a meal on the step, they do the same.  We bring each other mail, a shared burden. It's good to see faces, I think they like seein' mine. In this sprawl, this steel beast, it's humanity that keeps the darkness at bay.",
            "The place I call home sits on the edge of things. Out past the city limits, where the pavement gives way to dust and the houses start lookin' alike. They call it suburbia, I reckon, though it ain't got the grit of a real town. Every damn yard's manicured to hell, same little boxy houses all lined up tight. You got your HOA lookin' over everyone's shoulder, makin' sure things stay proper. Concrete paths run down the center of the street, smooth as glass, not a crack to be found.  Two-car garages on every lot, doors standin' open like empty mouths. Mailboxes all clustered together at the end of the street, like a pack of crows.  \n\nMost of the houses are single story, hunkered down low to the ground. But sometimes you'll see one reachin' up, two stories tall, lookin' over the rest.  Folks here mostly keep to themselves. Old folks mostly, retired and settled in. You get a few younger ones, tryin' to make a go of it, but it ain't a place for ambition, that's for sure.\n\nThere's a couple of pools, fenced off like prisons, and some dusty paths windin' through the scrub. They call 'em walkin' trails, but ain't much to see out there. City's not far, though. Big enough that you can lose yourself in it, full of stores and noise. Mall's just a speck on the map, ain't nothin' special. Fifteen minutes to get there, back to the quiet again.\n\nA safe place, I reckon. Clean and quiet.  But it ain't got a soul.",
            "The town sits small, a shadow cast upon the outskirts of the city's sprawling bones. My patch of it, eastside, runs ragged. Houses hunkered low, patched and worn, rented out to those who live hand to mouth.  Not ugly, not truly. Neighbors say their hellos, smiles thin in the winter air. Crime crawls through these streets, a whisper compared to the hum of the city, but it bites. A boy gone, shot outside a bar last year, not far from our door. Our own losses, small things, a package here, a tool there, taken when not watched. The whole country bleeds, they say, from this sickness. Fentanyl, a white dust that steals breaths, leaving only silence. There are places to mend, to claw back from the edge, but the ghosts linger.\n\nYet, there is light. The schoolhouse, a beacon in this dusk. My son walks its halls, a mind that doesn't bend right, but finds acceptance there. No scorn in those halls, just a kind of quiet understanding. The teachers, the staff, they hold him up. The PTO, a band of souls, working to keep the flame alive, to keep the children fed. They feed all children, no matter the cost, no matter the family's burden.  \n\nThe city fathers, they patch up the main streets, the west side, where the money flows. But the east side, forgotten. A quiet resentment simmers here, a slow burn.\n\nStill, we stay. This town, it's in our blood now. Sixteen years, a lifetime it feels. We've built our lives here, roots sunk deep. This is where we belong, in this quiet, shadowed corner of the world.",
            "The Hill. That's where I live. Buildings rise up there, old bones scraping the sky. Some whisper of things past, names half-forgotten. Across the street, the old theater sits dark, a husk of what it once was. Down the road a piece, a bar spills out onto the sidewalk, neon flickering like fireflies on a humid night. Summer crowds gather there, a tangle of bodies seeking solace in the cheap beer and the company.  A few blocks up, the park sits, a green patch in the concrete sprawl. Walls of poured concrete enclose it, steps leading nowhere. Winter comes, the rain a relentless drum against the city's skin. Tents rise then, huddled close against the cold, a patchwork of humanity on the steps, seeking warmth in numbers. The only shelter from the storm. The city center, a heart beat away. A place to wash, to find a moment's peace. This place, it ain't pretty. Brick and mortar, scarred by time and neglect. But the people, they're the heart. Hilltop. Once a bad name, whispered in hushed tones.  The government swept in, trying to scrub clean the stain of violence. The stories linger, like ghosts in the wind. The people remember. They work hard, keep the streets clean, hold onto something precious in this rough world. They say a white girl shouldn't walk alone after dark. Maybe it's true. Maybe it's just the city talking, echoing old fears. But I walk those streets, see the kindness in tired eyes, the generosity in a shared cigarette. This place, it sees me. It knows what it means to fight for something, to hold onto hope in the face of darkness. Hilltop. It's home.  It's a place where a stranger can offer a coat, where a laundromat owner waits a few minutes too long, where a hand reaches out and says you're beautiful, you're valuable.  That's the Hilltop.",
            "The world out here is a different kind.  Michigan. Flat land giving way to towns that cater to tourists, folks with their cameras and their summer rents. No city lights, no Wal-Marts or Targets, not even an Applebee's to speak of. If you need something, you drive. But it's a beauty, this place. Water on all sides. Lake Michigan, a vast blue beast, and Charlevoix, smaller, but no less fierce. Every road leads to a shore, a sandy finger reaching out to the water.\n\nThe houses here, they tell a story. Not the new ones, crammed together like sardines in a can. These are older, some weathered and patched, others reborn in paint and new siding. Basements, full and deep, peeking out from beneath the earth. Aluminum, it shines like a forgotten promise. Colors, every shade imaginable, a patchwork quilt of memories. Yards, sprawling and green, with trampolines bouncing and swings creaking. Gardens bursting with life, fences holding in the livestock. Hardworking folks, pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.  Kids chasing fireflies, dogs barking, bikes and rollerblades weaving through the streets. You know your neighbors here, their faces etched in the landscape. Smiles and waves, a friendly nod. The lawns, they're kept neat, the grass a green carpet, trimmed and controlled. Not a place of fancy, but of comfort. A place to build a life.\n\nQuiet, yes, but not empty. The sheriff's office, a stoic sentinel, stands watch over the town. The health department, a promise of well-being. Down the road, the recycling center hums, a constant reminder of shared responsibility. The echo of baseball bats against leather, the roar of small planes taking flight, the scent of fresh-cut grass, all woven together into the fabric of this place. \n\nA place to land, a place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city sprawled, a concrete beast gnawing at the edges of what little green remained. Houses and shops, offices and plazas, all crammed together in a mosaic of brick and glass. Some places hummed with the din of commerce, others slept in the shadow of towering structures that scraped the sky. New restaurants popped up like weeds, their neon signs blinking promises of a taste of something different. Big chains and small mom-and-pop shops, all vying for a piece of the endless hunger.\n\nParks, green islands in the urban sea, were choked with the laughter of children. And the people, a kaleidoscope of faces and stories. A murmur of Yiddish drifted from a synagogue, the scent of incense rising like a prayer. A rainbow flag fluttered in the breeze, a defiant splash of color in a world often painted in shades of gray. Immigrants, refugees, each carrying their own history etched on their skin, their eyes holding the weight of a thousand miles.\n\nKorea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, these pockets of identity scattered across the city like fallen stars. A few miles to another world, a world where languages unknown and customs unfamiliar mingled with the humdrum routine of everyday life. But those miles could stretch into hours in the suffocating grip of traffic, a beast as relentless as the city itself. Cars, steel coffins on wheels, crawled along the asphalt arteries, spewing fumes into the air.\n\nThe city sprawled, it ate and it grew. New towers rose, steel and glass monuments to progress, to ambition. Some welcomed the influx, others saw it as a slow strangulation. The city, a hungry beast, forever demanding more. And still, within this concrete labyrinth, pockets of peace existed. Houses, small and humble, stood shoulder to shoulder, a testament to a time when life moved at a slower pace.  Families gathered on porches, children played in yards, a fragile echo of a simpler time.",
            "The houses here stand in neat rows, mostly single-family, though some are cut in two, stitched together like mismatched cloth. Mine sits with a patch of dirt in front and a drive to the left, starved for rain. A ghost of a time when the suburbs held the promise, the American dream, a hand outstretched. But the dream is a fading memory, a whisper on the wind. Still, these houses, these lawns, they hold on. They speak of a time when the world felt bright, a time before the slow and steady decay. \n\nYou can see it in the faces, the lines etched deep, the shadows in their eyes. The lawns are choked with weeds, cars rust.  The children still run, though, their laughter thin, their games a desperate attempt to carve out a world of their own. The old school stands, its walls whispering of a future that may never come. The churches are empty, their stained glass windows vacant eyes. But the basketball court hums with the rhythm of bouncing balls, a fleeting echo of joy.\n\nThe faces here, a mosaic of shades, mostly black. The air smells of asphalt and dust, of roasted peanuts and fried chicken. A supermarket, Super \"A,\" stands sentinel, owned by a family, Yemenis, the only ones not born under this sun.  \n\nA karate school, once full of eager boys, now a pharmacy, dispensing pills and promises. A movie theater, showing shadows of the past, shunned by the young, embraced by the old. A single highway cuts through the town, its exit a mile away. A petition for another, for progress, for a piece of the future, was met with resistance.  The elders, clutching their memories, said it would destroy the town.\n\nThey're building a new school, a monument to the hope that maybe, just maybe, something new can bloom from the ashes. We're choosing a mascot, a symbol for this town, a story to tell. I say a cyborg, a metal heart beating under a faded denim jacket, a log cabin nestled in a field of steel. A reminder that the past is never truly gone, that even in the rust and decay, there is a flicker of something wild, something free.",
            "You might pass it by, this place. Tucked behind the strip, a shadow of the gleaming storefronts. You wouldn't think to look there for homes. Not the kind folks want anyway. But cut back behind the old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty most the year save for a few summers when families gather, and you'll find a world.  \n\nA line of apartments runs back there, like dolls nested one inside the other, taken apart and laid out in the sun. The first set, those are the ones the news folks have been after. Best leave them be. Appearances, they can be deceiving. But the ones beside them, the next two sets, they hold a different kind of peace. A peace unknown to most who pass by. \n\nAcross from them sits the college, a quiet thing, a few buildings hunched against the road. Students shuffle in, coffee in hand, eyes heavy at seven in the morning, starting their slow days. The iron gates sigh open, one by one. Commuters shake fists, grumble about the delay. \n\nThe road, it splits. One way leads to neighborhood where a park sits, a rehab center on the other side. The rehab folks, they got furniture on the porch, a fan that churns the thick air, keeps things moving.  Kids run in the grass, cartwheels and laughter, bees buzzing in the flower beds. Old folks walk their dogs, scowl at the teenagers on their boards, nod politely at the girls by the swings, whispering about boys and things on the little screens. \n\nThere's a sushi place in the strip mall, cheap eats, never too crowded. A swimming supply store next door, a nail salon tucked in between. Fill your pool, get your nails done, eat some chicken, all in one stop. The beauty of a place like this. And a frozen yogurt place, the kind where you build your own mountain of sweetness. \n\nTeens with their sugary cups, they do tricks on their boards, puff on things they think makes them cool. \n\nThis is the South, a slice of it. A place where time moves slow. Where nothing changes, not really.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked, the car rolling past fields of corn that stretched out like a boundless ocean. “This is it,” I said, knowing the sight would strike her dumb. She was a child of the towns where the grocery store was but a stone’s throw from the front door. Openness like this was a foreign country to her. The cornfields, endless and unwavering, mirrored the vastness of my own childhood. And in that expanse, she finally saw me, saw where I’d come from.\n\nTwo lanes of asphalt cut through the heart of it all, leading to a quarry filled with water, still and gray as a tombstone. Just past, a cluster of homes huddled together, brick and stucco sentinels against the wind. Half an acre each, they called it, a kingdom unto themselves, each owner tending their patch like a garden.  Spring brought a riot of color, flowers blooming in defiance of the hard earth. Come autumn, the trees turned, a slow burn of crimson and gold. Driveways, black and gleaming, held the sleek bodies of Mercedes, their chrome glinting in the sun like the eyes of predators.\n\nMy house, a shade of gray that mirrored the sky, stood at the end of the road. My neighbor, a Korean man, was already at work, his lawnmower a buzzing sawtooth against the quiet. He hummed a tune, a melody both mournful and joyful, lost in the rhythm of his labor. Everyone found it endearing, a quirky shadow against the manicured lawns. But there was a sadness in his eyes, a story etched deep in the lines around them.  He’d been a doctor once, a healer, but the years had worn him down.  He blended now with the green, a ghost in his John Deere, a whisper of a man.\n\nGeese honked in the side yard, chased by our terrier, a blur of white against the green.  Behind the house, a stream babbled, feeding the dark water of the quarry.  Bullfrogs croaked, a bass drum against the stillness, and the distant moo of cattle echoed across the fields.  A handmade bridge spanned the stream, leading to a hidden place, a tangle of trees and wildflowers. There, I’d built forts, a kingdom of sticks and dreams.  There, I’d chased rabbits and pretended to hunt with my slingshot, a small boy lost in the vastness of imagination.\n\nWinter came, a hard frost that turned the world white. The trees stood bare, skeletal fingers reaching for the sky. Snow fell, a soft shroud that blanketed everything, transforming the yard into a silent wonderland. Snow angels lay scattered like fallen stars, and snowmen stood sentinel, their coal eyes watching the world. My sister and I, we’d wage war with snowballs, building fortifications of packed snow, our weapons of choice.  \n\nIt was a world of our own, a winter kingdom where nothing mattered but the snow and the laughter and the fierce, childish joy of it all.",
            "The truth about Portland, Oregon, sits in the marrow of its bone: the meaning of \"weird.\" A sign, weathered paint peeling like sunburnt skin, hangs on the side of a building that somehow serves pizza, whiskey, music, and sin, clinging to the edge of legality like a hawk to a cliff. \"Keep Portland Weird,\" it proclaims. \n\nSome see it as a remembrance, a whisper of the city in its late bloom, the 90's and early 2000's when the whispers were low and the rents were cheap, when the shadows held a million creative souls and a thousand unique tribes. Others hear it as a siren song, an invitation to come partake in a world where the strange is celebrated, where \"weird\" is a badge of honor, not a brand of ostracization.\n\nYet the city swells, choked with the tide of California money and the concrete bones of new apartments. They come seeking the Portland of myth, the one that still breathes a little strange. But Portland, even with the tide, still holds its breath. \n\nWeirdness isn't about blind acceptance. It's about facing the things others shy from, the shadows that lurk just beneath the surface. It doesn't mean forsaking the comforts of the modern world, the endless stream of goods from distant shores.  There are a million ways to be different, to step outside the lines. Portland offers them all, and then some.  \n\nWalk down any street in my neighborhood, and you'll see it. Houses painted in the colors of a child's dreams, gardens overflowing with flowers and herbs and vegetables, a kaleidoscope of life spilling onto the sidewalks. And then there are the boxes. Free boxes, stacked like forgotten promises. Cardboard or plastic, they hold something more than discarded things. They hold a whisper of possibility, a treasure waiting to be found. Clothes, books, a shard of something lost, something precious. Every box holds a story, a flicker of the unknown. \n\nThat's what Portland is, at least to me. A thousand different kinds of weird, all woven together. Some walk past the boxes, eyes averted. Others seek them out, embrace the mystery. Some find solace in goat yoga, or in the roar of the Timbers stadium. Others drown their sorrows in cheap whiskey, chasing dreams that flicker like fireflies in the twilight. \n\nPortland has its demons, like any city. The shadows of addiction, the weight of homelessness, a sorrow that lingers like the scent of rain. But even in the darkness, there's a flicker of hope, a refusal to be swallowed whole. We are all flawed, all searching for something, for a place to belong. And maybe, just maybe, that's what makes Portland weird, and beautiful.",
            "The mountains, they were always there. Northward, bearing witness to the sun's slow bleed across the sky each dawn and dusk.  Even lost in the rat race, the grind of things, you couldn't shake them. Unmoving. Unshakable. Unburdened. They were a presence. Then on days when the world pressed down, when the soul felt wound tight, they'd call to you, silent and sure. And when you turned, they offered a kind of rest, a wellspring of strength to face the next day. \n\nCame here for school, first year. Those mountains north of the campus, that's what snagged me. The university, it had its own kind of beauty, sure. Buildings and ponds and trees, all holding a piece of my heart. But those mountains, they were kings.\n\nThe town itself, it had a charm. Shops and cafes, fueled by endless cups of black coffee and study nights. Walk a ways, the bus would take you, to the downtown, where the air hung heavy with the ghosts of time. Faded brick, storefronts and offices, a whisper of something older, something forgotten. \n\nThere, the town hummed with a kind of borrowed vigor, a reflection of the city next door. But just a few blocks further, and the quiet of the suburbs fell back in. Past the library, the peace settled like a shroud.  \n\nThe way the town breathed, it was a thing of wonder. This clash of worlds, so close, so intertwined. Memories, they were woven into the fabric of this place. Late nights with friends, rusted swings creaking in the park. The bustle of downtown, racing to catch a movie in the fancy theater, tickets courtesy of the university.\n\nBut there were shadows too, as there are in all places. The ponds, they held a stillness, a place for reflection, for tears falling in the darkness of an existential crisis. I knew that well enough.\n\nWatching turtles and ducks, insects going about their lives, each with a purpose, a role, I couldn't help but wonder about my own. What was my place in this grand, unknowable mess?\n\nI walked past the pond, past the park, past the houses whispering of normalcy, until I reached a main road. The sun, it was rising then, painting the sky with fire. And as I looked up, I realized I was heading north.\n\nThere they were. Mountains, stoic and vast, scraping the clouds. They spoke without words, a promise, a reminder.  Perseverance. Just breathe. Keep going.",
            "The neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Brooklyn. You’ll find it. The iron veins of the city’s transit run deep there. A place of concrete and brick, not unlike the rest of this sprawling borough. But walk its streets and you’ll see the tide has turned. Asian faces. Asian signs.  A supermarket on every other corner. \n\nLaundromats too. They hum with the murmur of daily life, a chorus of whirring machines and the scent of fabric softener. The food in these stores is good. Inexpensive. Convenient.  Four of them, all within a stone’s throw from where I stand. A testament to the changing face of the place.\n\nThey say Bensonhurst is diverse. A tapestry woven with threads of immigrants, their children, their grandchildren. But the Asian thread runs strong. Their businesses, their shops, their restaurants. They’ve woven themselves into the fabric of the neighborhood.\n\nThere’s a park nearby, a patch of green in this urban sprawl. Ten basketball courts, a field for kicking a ball around, a playground for the small ones. A fountain spouting water under the unforgiving sun.  A melting pot of children, all playing together, oblivious to the world outside.\n\nBut this is New York. The city never sleeps. The roar of engines, the thumping of bass from passing cars, a symphony of urban chaos. The buildings stand tall, most of them apartments, a testament to the city’s relentless growth.  Two-family houses too.  \n\nThe people, they’re a mixed bag. Kind enough, but loud. The streets echo with their voices, their laughter, their anger.  \n\nBe wary at night.  The city’s darkness hides its shadows.  A place where even the good can turn bad. A place where a stray fist or a hungry hand can snatch at your belongings. I’ve seen it myself.\n\nAnd the dogs. They leave their mark on the sidewalks, a reminder that even in this concrete jungle, nature finds a way. A constant stream of waste, a testament to the city’s indifference.\n\n Bensonhurst. A neighborhood of contradictions. A place of beauty and decay, hope and despair. A microcosm of the city itself.",
            "The sidewalks are few and far between in this place. Everything runs downhill, slick and unforgiving. My house sits perched atop the highest rise, the one they call \"the workout hill.\" A slick scar carved by the ceaseless flow of joggers seeking some measure of salvation from the sweat and the ache. No sidewalks here, just the ragged road, pocked and pitted, a scar across the earth. Overhead, the wires hang like frayed nerves, strung taut against the sky. Rain and wind, they come like thieves in the night, stripping bark and snapping branches. The lines below, they bear the marks, a patchwork quilt of repairs against the relentless assault.\n\nEvergreens rise on all sides, sentinels against the sky. But the people, they hate them.  The trees, they say, block the view. The view. So they build their houses high, perched on the hills like vultures, glass eyes staring out across the water. \n\nThe ocean, a bruise of blue on the horizon. Sometimes at dusk, the light catches it, paints it gold. But most days, the sky hangs heavy, a shroud of grey. The sun, a pale ghost behind the mist. Moss crawls across everything, a green death. It choked my car once, a month parked in the drive, a fuzzy green shroud. Three hours it took to scrape it off.\n\nChildren, they are few and far between. A school stands silent a few blocks down, its windows like vacant eyes. Mostly old folks here, their bones weary, their lives measured in the slow beat of the tide. But the dogs, they run.  Leashes slack, they chase each other down the road, a pack of shadows against the grey. A stray once wandered into my house, a ghost in the stillness. Shooed it back out, the wind carrying its whimper.\n\nRabbits, they hop in the undergrowth, plump and defiant.  The gardeners curse them, their noses twitching, their claws tearing at the earth. But my cats, they see them as sport, their eyes gleaming with hunger.\n\nAnd the birds, they come and go. Sparrows flitting, hummingbirds a blur of wings. Hawks and eagles, they soar on the wind, until the crows, black and raucous, chase them away.\n\nDown by the water, a few restaurants huddle, serving up the day's catch. The beach, it's a joke, just a sliver of sand. But the rocks, they are good for throwing. The bay, it's narrow, the opposite shore a distant blur.",
            "The town was small. A scrap of asphalt wedged between two black ribbons of highway. Dust swirled on the wind, carrying the scent of pine and the rumble of engines. The street ran straight, a vein through a heart of quiet houses. A few souls came and went. Faces known, cars familiar.  He saw them all from the corner, the house like a sentinel at the junction. A truck, rusted and patched, sat in the gravel-strewn yard. Inside, the family, four of them, moved like shadows. Wife, daughters, their ghosts flitting between rooms. Days bled together, a rhythm of chores and quiet. Sledding in winter, the wind whistling through the bare branches. The smell of smoke in the fall, leaves burning under the gray November sky. The sound of a mower, a constant drone through the long summer months. Trees, giants reaching towards the sun, their roots snaking through the earth. It was a place of muted sounds, of watchful eyes.  \n\nThe garage, a sanctuary of gears and grease, offered a different kind of silence. There, he worked on the truck, the engine a low growl in the stillness. Sometimes, the garage door would creak open, and he’d feel the pulse of the neighborhood, a slow, steady beat. Holidays brought a ripple of activity, strangers’ cars crowding the street, voices echoing through the quiet. But mostly, it was a place of shadows and stillness. A place of home.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the heart of the high desert, a land of dust and grit. Brown stretches to the horizon, broken only by the occasional manicured lawn, a testament to a man's futile struggle against the elements. It was different back in the nineties, houses scattered like tumbleweeds. Now they press closer, encroaching like a creeping vine. The city is swallowing the desert whole, though maybe that's the way of things. Most folks are decent enough, kind in their weathered way, but there's good and bad in every place. Here, mostly old folks, their lives etched like canyons in their faces.  Stores line the streets, the familiar chains, the names a whisper of the outside world. No Whole Foods, no fancy markets. For that, you'd have to head further, into the maw of some distant city. The work here is hard, mostly building, fitting the new to the old. It's a place still raw, the land open, waiting. A cold fear settles in my gut at the thought of it filling up. I left the city once, and I won't go back.  \n\nMy work is with drywall and T-bar, chasing the ghosts of progress. But it's the desert itself that holds me.  The creatures that scuttle and climb, the lizards basking on sun-baked rocks, the insects that flit in the twilight.  My children, their eyes wide with wonder, chasing them like phantoms. They've learned the rhythm of the desert, the language of the wind.\n\nThere are things to see here, remnants of a past long gone, museums and monuments to a history buried beneath the sand. But the true beauty lies in the silence, in the vastness of the sky, in the way the sun paints the dust with fire. This is Victorville, a place of harsh beauty, a place where the future bleeds into the past, a place where we learn to live with the ghosts of what was.",
            "They ask about my neighborhood. A peculiar notion. Most, I reckon, would speak of picket fences and manicured lawns, of houses and children playing. But my neighborhood ain't like that. It's the brick and mortar of this place, the college walls, the echoing corridors, the clacking of trays in the dining hall. My community, these scattered souls sharing the same cinderblock rooms, they're my neighbors. The campus itself, this sprawling concrete heart, that's my world.\n\nThere are dwellings here, though not the kind you'd find in some quiet suburb. Apartments, they call them, crammed with a dozen bodies pressed together under a single roof. Then there are the houses, scattered like forgotten relics, occupied mostly by ghosts of past students, alumni come back to haunt these halls. And finally, the dormitories, vast, hulking structures that swallow up hundreds of young lives, each room a cage of shared dreams and whispered anxieties.\n\nThe people here, a patchwork quilt of faces and stories.  The air hums with a thousand languages, a symphony of ambitions and fears. The young ones, wide-eyed and eager, they crowd the dorms. The older ones, weary and world-worn, they seek solace in the shadows of the houses. The staff, they move like phantoms, their faces etched with the weariness of endless semesters.\n\nThe campus itself offers a strange kind of comfort. Stores line the walkways, offering sustenance and trinkets, a meager respite from the endless grind. And there's a park, a sliver of green amidst the concrete, where students gather to escape the confines of their classrooms. It's a fragile haven, this park, a testament to the human need for beauty in a world of brick and steel.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  \n\nRiverdale's dust still clung to my boots when we came to Stockbridge. My kin, they stayed behind. Tears fell, hot on my cheeks. A hard goodbye. Mama and Papa, they said it was for the best. A better place. Safer streets. A school without the shadows. \n\nStockbridge. \n\nTime wore it down, smoothed the edges. New faces, some friendly, some with eyes like broken glass. Mr. Glen and his brood, they were next door. Gave us shelter, a place at their table. Dennis too, for a while. Family, in a way. I remember the day they wed, again. A feast, music, laughter. I caught a ribbon, a thing of white silk, tossed from the bride's hand. A memory, like a firefly in the dark. \n\nThere's a maze here, these streets. But now I have a map, a guide in my hand. I wander, sometimes.  Kason and Curtis, they come with me. We walk the paths, the ones lit by the dying sun.  They were young, those days. We played games, fought with joysticks, dreamed big dreams.\n\nI find peace in the green spaces. Trees, grass, the whisper of wind through the leaves. It stills the noise in my head.  Sometimes I bring wood, practice with a blade. A wooden thing, not for harming.  A dance, a rhythm I find solace in.\n\nThere's a court, for tennis and ball. I haven't touched them in years, but they stand there, silent sentinels. A reminder of games played, under a sun-drenched sky. My father, he taught me. Mr. Graves too, a hard man, but with a kind heart. We bled sweat, we laughed, we learned. \n\nStockbridge. It's etched in my bones. The good, the bad, the memories that linger like smoke. The best is yet to come, they say. I believe it.",
            "The college sits close enough to call neighbor. A convenience, some might say. And the neighborhood, well, it's a low-slung sprawl mostly of brick and concrete. A few joints here and there, greasy spoons and places that serve up whiskey long past the sun's setting. One of them, just changed its name, got fancier. Prices went up too, though the drink ain't much different, the company neither. Mostly kids, young and restless, or folks scraping by, the rent cheap enough to swallow whole. Children, too, a swarm of them, running barefoot in the dust, the school just a stone's throw.\n\nNeighbors? No need for them. Smoke curls from their doorways, the air thick with its scent. The building manager, he's put a goddamn air freshener up, a metal box that spews sickly sweet fumes. A pathetic attempt, meant to mask the truth. \n\nThe buildings, old bones clinging to life, paint peeling like sunburnt skin. New ones down the street, all shiny and sharp, but built on lies. Cheap materials, a fast buck, the rent a king's ransom. But the college nearby, that's the real draw, the blood in the veins of this place.\n\nCheap eats, five minutes away, paper plates and microwaved meals. Across the street, a gas station, a haven for the lost and weary. The road, though, they spruced it up last year. Concrete smooth, grass along the edges, a city's attempt at beautification. But my building, it sits under a canopy of trees, their branches thick and gnarled. A few stumps remain, reminders of what was cut away. Behind it, another wall of trees, then more apartments, a grim reflection of this one. \n\nForty-second. It's a name that holds no meaning. Behind me, forty-third, where the sidewalks crumble and the buildings sag. The trees there are thicker, hiding the ugliness, trying to breathe life into a dying place.\n\nCrime, it whispers in the shadows. Some say it's the apartments on forty-third, but the truth is, it lives in every corner, in every heart. And yet, I stay.\n\nIt's cheap, within reach. And the college, it's close enough to walk to. Two bus stops, a lifeline to the rest of the world.",
            "The houses squat on the cul-de-sac, two to a frame, spaced thin as a ghost's breath. Yellow paint bled across their clapboard skin, each porch white as bone, roofs a rusted green. Most knew each other, these folks. At dusk they'd gather at the ends of driveways, unpaved and cracked, to spin tales as the children darted 'bout with their toys, chalk dust staining the concrete. A respite from the cold steel world, it felt. A flicker of the old ways. Sky a vast expanse, blue as a forgotten dream, clouds like white driftwood scudding across.\n\nBut the sky ain't always kind. This season, the air hung heavy with warnings. The sirens, they shrieked in the night, a sound that scraped the marrow. We sought shelter, me and my dogs, crammed in the tub, the smallest shivering against my chest, her fur damp with fear. The big one, he paced, a restless shadow in the living room, whimpering at the wind's moan. Hailstones hammered the roof, a thousand tiny fists drumming a grim rhythm. The road itself steamed after the storm, the heat rising like a phantom, the air thick with the smell of wet earth. The sun, it broke through the clouds, a sudden blazing eye, and rain fell heavy, cleansing. A double rainbow arched across the sky, a fragile promise. I grabbed my camera, snapped a few pictures, a meager offering to the world beyond this valley.\n\nFolks emerged from their hiding places, slow and quiet. Children, faces streaked with dirt and wonder, mothers with weary smiles. The world spun back to its familiar rhythm. Dinner sizzled on stoves, laughter carried on the breeze. A quiet corner of the world, forty minutes from the city's heart. I'd found a haven here, a place where roosters crowed at dawn, and a donkey brayed in the twilight. A place where life, for all its fragility, held a strange, beautiful beauty.",
            "The street I landed on was just as the bell tolled for eighth grade.  Making kin was slow work.  Two houses down, one boy.  A young'un down the way, another.  They're gone now, but the ghosts linger. The rest, the ones who were here when I came, still stand their ground.  It's a neighborhood like any other, houses two stories high reaching for the sun.  Kids spill out on weekends, when the air is warm, a symphony of laughter and shouts.  Most days, a hush falls.  Never had a cross word with a soul in these parts.  Left to your own devices, unless need calls.  Packages come and go, never a hand laid on them. Trust, you learn it here.  \n\nDown the road, a patch of green.  A park.  Years bleed into each other there.  Basketball, football, baseball, played with the boys.  A memory, sharp as a broken bone, of an elbow to the nose, a football game gone wrong.  But the good outweighs the bad. Now, it's the littl'uns, my cousin's children, that draw me there. Their eyes wide, their laughter ringing, on swings and slides.  The park, a wellspring of memory,  a whisper of what was and what could be.\n\nFood, a tapestry woven from every corner of the world.  Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a stone's throw.  But now, folks order their sustenance delivered, a screen between them and the world. Fast food, the siren song.  Pizza, a constant hum.  Stores line the streets, holding every want and need.  Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store, a familiar face in this place, its shelves stocked with the bounty of the Midwest. Even a shop owned by those who came from across the sea, where the scent of spices hangs heavy in the air.\n\nMine is a neighborhood forged in the quiet hum of ordinary days.  The world, I see, is full of shadows.  My heart swells with a quiet gratitude for this little haven.",
            "The town sits squat in the South Carolina flatlands, no different from a hundred others, save for the peaches. They call it the Peach Capital, a proclamation etched on the rusted sign that marks the way in.  The land stretches out, an endless quilt of orchard and pasture. Houses, most two stories, huddle back from the dirt roads, roofs corrugated iron or weathered gray. Some stand empty, windows dark, waiting for a rain that might never come. At the crossroads, a single semaphore blinks like a tired eye. That's where the commerce gathers, a handful of places to eat, a pharmacy smelling of old cough syrup and cherry coke, a grocery store that stocks barely enough to keep the locals going. The Dollar General, that's where the real lifeblood flows, aisles stacked high with the necessities. There's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a woman with a smile that's seen too much, and next door, a place to clip and clip the hounds. The doctor and the vet, both small, tucked away, serve those who stay. The schoolhouse stands tall, a brick sentinel, but only teaches till fifth grade. After that, the young ones head out, leaving behind the quiet, the dust, the slow, sweet scent of peaches. There's talk of a park, a patch of green in this sea of brown, but for now, there's just the road, stretching on, leading to nothing and everything.",
            "The first whisper of this place came to me on the hum of a missing persons podcast. A curious thing. Each box in these buildings went for a king's ransom, a thousand dollars a month easy. Never heard a word of this story, neither had the boys. Maybe it's the hunger. I know some of them, eyes red-rimmed, weeping into their pillows at night. The world bites hard, but we've learned to make do. The scent of dust clings to you—flea market toys, moth-eaten clothes. You smell less as you grow older. Smoke, maybe, or the weight of things settling in. But the flea market, it stays, a phantom in the air. The smell of adulthood, a stack of yellowed magazines on a silent piano. It sinks into the leather, stays there even after the water runs. \n\nThree shops at walkin' distance, these parts. Start at the edge, you'll come across two charity bins, a library, a place for old books, and a shop full of curiosities. Downtown's a river of steel and flesh, a roar every mornin'. But in these shops, silence. No matter how many souls pass by, the air holds its breath. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more of them come. Cars and people, a tide over the land. A growin' city they say. Headquartered for an empire of the internet, its wounds still bleed. Like New York, it feels. Everyone scrambles after their own ghosts, ain't no time for askings. You can be alone, quiet, and they'll leave you be. Not like the South, where a little concern is a badge of honor. No prying eyes here. Keep your shell, they'll let you be. The city'll roll on, just like the tide. \n\nBut there's a hum here, too. A piano next door, two singers singin' their hearts out upstairs. A community, that's what it is. We come together for births and deaths, share meals and stories.  Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of my neighbors, they're good folks. Treat each other right. I keep my corner clean, leave a meal on the step, they do the same.  We bring each other mail, a shared burden. It's good to see faces, I think they like seein' mine. In this sprawl, this steel beast, it's humanity that keeps the darkness at bay.",
            "The place I call home sits on the edge of things. Out past the city limits, where the pavement gives way to dust and the houses start lookin' alike. They call it suburbia, I reckon, though it ain't got the grit of a real town. Every damn yard's manicured to hell, same little boxy houses all lined up tight. You got your HOA lookin' over everyone's shoulder, makin' sure things stay proper. Concrete paths run down the center of the street, smooth as glass, not a crack to be found.  Two-car garages on every lot, doors standin' open like empty mouths. Mailboxes all clustered together at the end of the street, like a pack of crows.  \n\nMost of the houses are single story, hunkered down low to the ground. But sometimes you'll see one reachin' up, two stories tall, lookin' over the rest.  Folks here mostly keep to themselves. Old folks mostly, retired and settled in. You get a few younger ones, tryin' to make a go of it, but it ain't a place for ambition, that's for sure.\n\nThere's a couple of pools, fenced off like prisons, and some dusty paths windin' through the scrub. They call 'em walkin' trails, but ain't much to see out there. City's not far, though. Big enough that you can lose yourself in it, full of stores and noise. Mall's just a speck on the map, ain't nothin' special. Fifteen minutes to get there, back to the quiet again.\n\nA safe place, I reckon. Clean and quiet.  But it ain't got a soul.",
            "The town sits small, a shadow cast upon the outskirts of the city's sprawling bones. My patch of it, eastside, runs ragged. Houses hunkered low, patched and worn, rented out to those who live hand to mouth.  Not ugly, not truly. Neighbors say their hellos, smiles thin in the winter air. Crime crawls through these streets, a whisper compared to the hum of the city, but it bites. A boy gone, shot outside a bar last year, not far from our door. Our own losses, small things, a package here, a tool there, taken when not watched. The whole country bleeds, they say, from this sickness. Fentanyl, a white dust that steals breaths, leaving only silence. There are places to mend, to claw back from the edge, but the ghosts linger.\n\nYet, there is light. The schoolhouse, a beacon in this dusk. My son walks its halls, a mind that doesn't bend right, but finds acceptance there. No scorn in those halls, just a kind of quiet understanding. The teachers, the staff, they hold him up. The PTO, a band of souls, working to keep the flame alive, to keep the children fed. They feed all children, no matter the cost, no matter the family's burden.  \n\nThe city fathers, they patch up the main streets, the west side, where the money flows. But the east side, forgotten. A quiet resentment simmers here, a slow burn.\n\nStill, we stay. This town, it's in our blood now. Sixteen years, a lifetime it feels. We've built our lives here, roots sunk deep. This is where we belong, in this quiet, shadowed corner of the world.",
            "The Hill. That's where I live. Buildings rise up there, old bones scraping the sky. Some whisper of things past, names half-forgotten. Across the street, the old theater sits dark, a husk of what it once was. Down the road a piece, a bar spills out onto the sidewalk, neon flickering like fireflies on a humid night. Summer crowds gather there, a tangle of bodies seeking solace in the cheap beer and the company.  A few blocks up, the park sits, a green patch in the concrete sprawl. Walls of poured concrete enclose it, steps leading nowhere. Winter comes, the rain a relentless drum against the city's skin. Tents rise then, huddled close against the cold, a patchwork of humanity on the steps, seeking warmth in numbers. The only shelter from the storm. The city center, a heart beat away. A place to wash, to find a moment's peace. This place, it ain't pretty. Brick and mortar, scarred by time and neglect. But the people, they're the heart. Hilltop. Once a bad name, whispered in hushed tones.  The government swept in, trying to scrub clean the stain of violence. The stories linger, like ghosts in the wind. The people remember. They work hard, keep the streets clean, hold onto something precious in this rough world. They say a white girl shouldn't walk alone after dark. Maybe it's true. Maybe it's just the city talking, echoing old fears. But I walk those streets, see the kindness in tired eyes, the generosity in a shared cigarette. This place, it sees me. It knows what it means to fight for something, to hold onto hope in the face of darkness. Hilltop. It's home.  It's a place where a stranger can offer a coat, where a laundromat owner waits a few minutes too long, where a hand reaches out and says you're beautiful, you're valuable.  That's the Hilltop.",
            "The world out here is a different kind.  Michigan. Flat land giving way to towns that cater to tourists, folks with their cameras and their summer rents. No city lights, no Wal-Marts or Targets, not even an Applebee's to speak of. If you need something, you drive. But it's a beauty, this place. Water on all sides. Lake Michigan, a vast blue beast, and Charlevoix, smaller, but no less fierce. Every road leads to a shore, a sandy finger reaching out to the water.\n\nThe houses here, they tell a story. Not the new ones, crammed together like sardines in a can. These are older, some weathered and patched, others reborn in paint and new siding. Basements, full and deep, peeking out from beneath the earth. Aluminum, it shines like a forgotten promise. Colors, every shade imaginable, a patchwork quilt of memories. Yards, sprawling and green, with trampolines bouncing and swings creaking. Gardens bursting with life, fences holding in the livestock. Hardworking folks, pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.  Kids chasing fireflies, dogs barking, bikes and rollerblades weaving through the streets. You know your neighbors here, their faces etched in the landscape. Smiles and waves, a friendly nod. The lawns, they're kept neat, the grass a green carpet, trimmed and controlled. Not a place of fancy, but of comfort. A place to build a life.\n\nQuiet, yes, but not empty. The sheriff's office, a stoic sentinel, stands watch over the town. The health department, a promise of well-being. Down the road, the recycling center hums, a constant reminder of shared responsibility. The echo of baseball bats against leather, the roar of small planes taking flight, the scent of fresh-cut grass, all woven together into the fabric of this place. \n\nA place to land, a place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city sprawled, a concrete beast gnawing at the edges of what little green remained. Houses and shops, offices and plazas, all crammed together in a mosaic of brick and glass. Some places hummed with the din of commerce, others slept in the shadow of towering structures that scraped the sky. New restaurants popped up like weeds, their neon signs blinking promises of a taste of something different. Big chains and small mom-and-pop shops, all vying for a piece of the endless hunger.\n\nParks, green islands in the urban sea, were choked with the laughter of children. And the people, a kaleidoscope of faces and stories. A murmur of Yiddish drifted from a synagogue, the scent of incense rising like a prayer. A rainbow flag fluttered in the breeze, a defiant splash of color in a world often painted in shades of gray. Immigrants, refugees, each carrying their own history etched on their skin, their eyes holding the weight of a thousand miles.\n\nKorea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, these pockets of identity scattered across the city like fallen stars. A few miles to another world, a world where languages unknown and customs unfamiliar mingled with the humdrum routine of everyday life. But those miles could stretch into hours in the suffocating grip of traffic, a beast as relentless as the city itself. Cars, steel coffins on wheels, crawled along the asphalt arteries, spewing fumes into the air.\n\nThe city sprawled, it ate and it grew. New towers rose, steel and glass monuments to progress, to ambition. Some welcomed the influx, others saw it as a slow strangulation. The city, a hungry beast, forever demanding more. And still, within this concrete labyrinth, pockets of peace existed. Houses, small and humble, stood shoulder to shoulder, a testament to a time when life moved at a slower pace.  Families gathered on porches, children played in yards, a fragile echo of a simpler time.",
            "The houses here stand in neat rows, mostly single-family, though some are cut in two, stitched together like mismatched cloth. Mine sits with a patch of dirt in front and a drive to the left, starved for rain. A ghost of a time when the suburbs held the promise, the American dream, a hand outstretched. But the dream is a fading memory, a whisper on the wind. Still, these houses, these lawns, they hold on. They speak of a time when the world felt bright, a time before the slow and steady decay. \n\nYou can see it in the faces, the lines etched deep, the shadows in their eyes. The lawns are choked with weeds, cars rust.  The children still run, though, their laughter thin, their games a desperate attempt to carve out a world of their own. The old school stands, its walls whispering of a future that may never come. The churches are empty, their stained glass windows vacant eyes. But the basketball court hums with the rhythm of bouncing balls, a fleeting echo of joy.\n\nThe faces here, a mosaic of shades, mostly black. The air smells of asphalt and dust, of roasted peanuts and fried chicken. A supermarket, Super \"A,\" stands sentinel, owned by a family, Yemenis, the only ones not born under this sun.  \n\nA karate school, once full of eager boys, now a pharmacy, dispensing pills and promises. A movie theater, showing shadows of the past, shunned by the young, embraced by the old. A single highway cuts through the town, its exit a mile away. A petition for another, for progress, for a piece of the future, was met with resistance.  The elders, clutching their memories, said it would destroy the town.\n\nThey're building a new school, a monument to the hope that maybe, just maybe, something new can bloom from the ashes. We're choosing a mascot, a symbol for this town, a story to tell. I say a cyborg, a metal heart beating under a faded denim jacket, a log cabin nestled in a field of steel. A reminder that the past is never truly gone, that even in the rust and decay, there is a flicker of something wild, something free.",
            "You might pass it by, this place. Tucked behind the strip, a shadow of the gleaming storefronts. You wouldn't think to look there for homes. Not the kind folks want anyway. But cut back behind the old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty most the year save for a few summers when families gather, and you'll find a world.  \n\nA line of apartments runs back there, like dolls nested one inside the other, taken apart and laid out in the sun. The first set, those are the ones the news folks have been after. Best leave them be. Appearances, they can be deceiving. But the ones beside them, the next two sets, they hold a different kind of peace. A peace unknown to most who pass by. \n\nAcross from them sits the college, a quiet thing, a few buildings hunched against the road. Students shuffle in, coffee in hand, eyes heavy at seven in the morning, starting their slow days. The iron gates sigh open, one by one. Commuters shake fists, grumble about the delay. \n\nThe road, it splits. One way leads to neighborhood where a park sits, a rehab center on the other side. The rehab folks, they got furniture on the porch, a fan that churns the thick air, keeps things moving.  Kids run in the grass, cartwheels and laughter, bees buzzing in the flower beds. Old folks walk their dogs, scowl at the teenagers on their boards, nod politely at the girls by the swings, whispering about boys and things on the little screens. \n\nThere's a sushi place in the strip mall, cheap eats, never too crowded. A swimming supply store next door, a nail salon tucked in between. Fill your pool, get your nails done, eat some chicken, all in one stop. The beauty of a place like this. And a frozen yogurt place, the kind where you build your own mountain of sweetness. \n\nTeens with their sugary cups, they do tricks on their boards, puff on things they think makes them cool. \n\nThis is the South, a slice of it. A place where time moves slow. Where nothing changes, not really.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked, the car rolling past fields of corn that stretched out like a boundless ocean. “This is it,” I said, knowing the sight would strike her dumb. She was a child of the towns where the grocery store was but a stone’s throw from the front door. Openness like this was a foreign country to her. The cornfields, endless and unwavering, mirrored the vastness of my own childhood. And in that expanse, she finally saw me, saw where I’d come from.\n\nTwo lanes of asphalt cut through the heart of it all, leading to a quarry filled with water, still and gray as a tombstone. Just past, a cluster of homes huddled together, brick and stucco sentinels against the wind. Half an acre each, they called it, a kingdom unto themselves, each owner tending their patch like a garden.  Spring brought a riot of color, flowers blooming in defiance of the hard earth. Come autumn, the trees turned, a slow burn of crimson and gold. Driveways, black and gleaming, held the sleek bodies of Mercedes, their chrome glinting in the sun like the eyes of predators.\n\nMy house, a shade of gray that mirrored the sky, stood at the end of the road. My neighbor, a Korean man, was already at work, his lawnmower a buzzing sawtooth against the quiet. He hummed a tune, a melody both mournful and joyful, lost in the rhythm of his labor. Everyone found it endearing, a quirky shadow against the manicured lawns. But there was a sadness in his eyes, a story etched deep in the lines around them.  He’d been a doctor once, a healer, but the years had worn him down.  He blended now with the green, a ghost in his John Deere, a whisper of a man.\n\nGeese honked in the side yard, chased by our terrier, a blur of white against the green.  Behind the house, a stream babbled, feeding the dark water of the quarry.  Bullfrogs croaked, a bass drum against the stillness, and the distant moo of cattle echoed across the fields.  A handmade bridge spanned the stream, leading to a hidden place, a tangle of trees and wildflowers. There, I’d built forts, a kingdom of sticks and dreams.  There, I’d chased rabbits and pretended to hunt with my slingshot, a small boy lost in the vastness of imagination.\n\nWinter came, a hard frost that turned the world white. The trees stood bare, skeletal fingers reaching for the sky. Snow fell, a soft shroud that blanketed everything, transforming the yard into a silent wonderland. Snow angels lay scattered like fallen stars, and snowmen stood sentinel, their coal eyes watching the world. My sister and I, we’d wage war with snowballs, building fortifications of packed snow, our weapons of choice.  \n\nIt was a world of our own, a winter kingdom where nothing mattered but the snow and the laughter and the fierce, childish joy of it all.",
            "The truth about Portland, Oregon, sits in the marrow of its bone: the meaning of \"weird.\" A sign, weathered paint peeling like sunburnt skin, hangs on the side of a building that somehow serves pizza, whiskey, music, and sin, clinging to the edge of legality like a hawk to a cliff. \"Keep Portland Weird,\" it proclaims. \n\nSome see it as a remembrance, a whisper of the city in its late bloom, the 90's and early 2000's when the whispers were low and the rents were cheap, when the shadows held a million creative souls and a thousand unique tribes. Others hear it as a siren song, an invitation to come partake in a world where the strange is celebrated, where \"weird\" is a badge of honor, not a brand of ostracization.\n\nYet the city swells, choked with the tide of California money and the concrete bones of new apartments. They come seeking the Portland of myth, the one that still breathes a little strange. But Portland, even with the tide, still holds its breath. \n\nWeirdness isn't about blind acceptance. It's about facing the things others shy from, the shadows that lurk just beneath the surface. It doesn't mean forsaking the comforts of the modern world, the endless stream of goods from distant shores.  There are a million ways to be different, to step outside the lines. Portland offers them all, and then some.  \n\nWalk down any street in my neighborhood, and you'll see it. Houses painted in the colors of a child's dreams, gardens overflowing with flowers and herbs and vegetables, a kaleidoscope of life spilling onto the sidewalks. And then there are the boxes. Free boxes, stacked like forgotten promises. Cardboard or plastic, they hold something more than discarded things. They hold a whisper of possibility, a treasure waiting to be found. Clothes, books, a shard of something lost, something precious. Every box holds a story, a flicker of the unknown. \n\nThat's what Portland is, at least to me. A thousand different kinds of weird, all woven together. Some walk past the boxes, eyes averted. Others seek them out, embrace the mystery. Some find solace in goat yoga, or in the roar of the Timbers stadium. Others drown their sorrows in cheap whiskey, chasing dreams that flicker like fireflies in the twilight. \n\nPortland has its demons, like any city. The shadows of addiction, the weight of homelessness, a sorrow that lingers like the scent of rain. But even in the darkness, there's a flicker of hope, a refusal to be swallowed whole. We are all flawed, all searching for something, for a place to belong. And maybe, just maybe, that's what makes Portland weird, and beautiful.",
            "The mountains, they were always there. Northward, bearing witness to the sun's slow bleed across the sky each dawn and dusk.  Even lost in the rat race, the grind of things, you couldn't shake them. Unmoving. Unshakable. Unburdened. They were a presence. Then on days when the world pressed down, when the soul felt wound tight, they'd call to you, silent and sure. And when you turned, they offered a kind of rest, a wellspring of strength to face the next day. \n\nCame here for school, first year. Those mountains north of the campus, that's what snagged me. The university, it had its own kind of beauty, sure. Buildings and ponds and trees, all holding a piece of my heart. But those mountains, they were kings.\n\nThe town itself, it had a charm. Shops and cafes, fueled by endless cups of black coffee and study nights. Walk a ways, the bus would take you, to the downtown, where the air hung heavy with the ghosts of time. Faded brick, storefronts and offices, a whisper of something older, something forgotten. \n\nThere, the town hummed with a kind of borrowed vigor, a reflection of the city next door. But just a few blocks further, and the quiet of the suburbs fell back in. Past the library, the peace settled like a shroud.  \n\nThe way the town breathed, it was a thing of wonder. This clash of worlds, so close, so intertwined. Memories, they were woven into the fabric of this place. Late nights with friends, rusted swings creaking in the park. The bustle of downtown, racing to catch a movie in the fancy theater, tickets courtesy of the university.\n\nBut there were shadows too, as there are in all places. The ponds, they held a stillness, a place for reflection, for tears falling in the darkness of an existential crisis. I knew that well enough.\n\nWatching turtles and ducks, insects going about their lives, each with a purpose, a role, I couldn't help but wonder about my own. What was my place in this grand, unknowable mess?\n\nI walked past the pond, past the park, past the houses whispering of normalcy, until I reached a main road. The sun, it was rising then, painting the sky with fire. And as I looked up, I realized I was heading north.\n\nThere they were. Mountains, stoic and vast, scraping the clouds. They spoke without words, a promise, a reminder.  Perseverance. Just breathe. Keep going.",
            "The neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Brooklyn. You’ll find it. The iron veins of the city’s transit run deep there. A place of concrete and brick, not unlike the rest of this sprawling borough. But walk its streets and you’ll see the tide has turned. Asian faces. Asian signs.  A supermarket on every other corner. \n\nLaundromats too. They hum with the murmur of daily life, a chorus of whirring machines and the scent of fabric softener. The food in these stores is good. Inexpensive. Convenient.  Four of them, all within a stone’s throw from where I stand. A testament to the changing face of the place.\n\nThey say Bensonhurst is diverse. A tapestry woven with threads of immigrants, their children, their grandchildren. But the Asian thread runs strong. Their businesses, their shops, their restaurants. They’ve woven themselves into the fabric of the neighborhood.\n\nThere’s a park nearby, a patch of green in this urban sprawl. Ten basketball courts, a field for kicking a ball around, a playground for the small ones. A fountain spouting water under the unforgiving sun.  A melting pot of children, all playing together, oblivious to the world outside.\n\nBut this is New York. The city never sleeps. The roar of engines, the thumping of bass from passing cars, a symphony of urban chaos. The buildings stand tall, most of them apartments, a testament to the city’s relentless growth.  Two-family houses too.  \n\nThe people, they’re a mixed bag. Kind enough, but loud. The streets echo with their voices, their laughter, their anger.  \n\nBe wary at night.  The city’s darkness hides its shadows.  A place where even the good can turn bad. A place where a stray fist or a hungry hand can snatch at your belongings. I’ve seen it myself.\n\nAnd the dogs. They leave their mark on the sidewalks, a reminder that even in this concrete jungle, nature finds a way. A constant stream of waste, a testament to the city’s indifference.\n\n Bensonhurst. A neighborhood of contradictions. A place of beauty and decay, hope and despair. A microcosm of the city itself.",
            "The sidewalks are few and far between in this place. Everything runs downhill, slick and unforgiving. My house sits perched atop the highest rise, the one they call \"the workout hill.\" A slick scar carved by the ceaseless flow of joggers seeking some measure of salvation from the sweat and the ache. No sidewalks here, just the ragged road, pocked and pitted, a scar across the earth. Overhead, the wires hang like frayed nerves, strung taut against the sky. Rain and wind, they come like thieves in the night, stripping bark and snapping branches. The lines below, they bear the marks, a patchwork quilt of repairs against the relentless assault.\n\nEvergreens rise on all sides, sentinels against the sky. But the people, they hate them.  The trees, they say, block the view. The view. So they build their houses high, perched on the hills like vultures, glass eyes staring out across the water. \n\nThe ocean, a bruise of blue on the horizon. Sometimes at dusk, the light catches it, paints it gold. But most days, the sky hangs heavy, a shroud of grey. The sun, a pale ghost behind the mist. Moss crawls across everything, a green death. It choked my car once, a month parked in the drive, a fuzzy green shroud. Three hours it took to scrape it off.\n\nChildren, they are few and far between. A school stands silent a few blocks down, its windows like vacant eyes. Mostly old folks here, their bones weary, their lives measured in the slow beat of the tide. But the dogs, they run.  Leashes slack, they chase each other down the road, a pack of shadows against the grey. A stray once wandered into my house, a ghost in the stillness. Shooed it back out, the wind carrying its whimper.\n\nRabbits, they hop in the undergrowth, plump and defiant.  The gardeners curse them, their noses twitching, their claws tearing at the earth. But my cats, they see them as sport, their eyes gleaming with hunger.\n\nAnd the birds, they come and go. Sparrows flitting, hummingbirds a blur of wings. Hawks and eagles, they soar on the wind, until the crows, black and raucous, chase them away.\n\nDown by the water, a few restaurants huddle, serving up the day's catch. The beach, it's a joke, just a sliver of sand. But the rocks, they are good for throwing. The bay, it's narrow, the opposite shore a distant blur.",
            "The town was small. A scrap of asphalt wedged between two black ribbons of highway. Dust swirled on the wind, carrying the scent of pine and the rumble of engines. The street ran straight, a vein through a heart of quiet houses. A few souls came and went. Faces known, cars familiar.  He saw them all from the corner, the house like a sentinel at the junction. A truck, rusted and patched, sat in the gravel-strewn yard. Inside, the family, four of them, moved like shadows. Wife, daughters, their ghosts flitting between rooms. Days bled together, a rhythm of chores and quiet. Sledding in winter, the wind whistling through the bare branches. The smell of smoke in the fall, leaves burning under the gray November sky. The sound of a mower, a constant drone through the long summer months. Trees, giants reaching towards the sun, their roots snaking through the earth. It was a place of muted sounds, of watchful eyes.  \n\nThe garage, a sanctuary of gears and grease, offered a different kind of silence. There, he worked on the truck, the engine a low growl in the stillness. Sometimes, the garage door would creak open, and he’d feel the pulse of the neighborhood, a slow, steady beat. Holidays brought a ripple of activity, strangers’ cars crowding the street, voices echoing through the quiet. But mostly, it was a place of shadows and stillness. A place of home.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the heart of the high desert, a land of dust and grit. Brown stretches to the horizon, broken only by the occasional manicured lawn, a testament to a man's futile struggle against the elements. It was different back in the nineties, houses scattered like tumbleweeds. Now they press closer, encroaching like a creeping vine. The city is swallowing the desert whole, though maybe that's the way of things. Most folks are decent enough, kind in their weathered way, but there's good and bad in every place. Here, mostly old folks, their lives etched like canyons in their faces.  Stores line the streets, the familiar chains, the names a whisper of the outside world. No Whole Foods, no fancy markets. For that, you'd have to head further, into the maw of some distant city. The work here is hard, mostly building, fitting the new to the old. It's a place still raw, the land open, waiting. A cold fear settles in my gut at the thought of it filling up. I left the city once, and I won't go back.  \n\nMy work is with drywall and T-bar, chasing the ghosts of progress. But it's the desert itself that holds me.  The creatures that scuttle and climb, the lizards basking on sun-baked rocks, the insects that flit in the twilight.  My children, their eyes wide with wonder, chasing them like phantoms. They've learned the rhythm of the desert, the language of the wind.\n\nThere are things to see here, remnants of a past long gone, museums and monuments to a history buried beneath the sand. But the true beauty lies in the silence, in the vastness of the sky, in the way the sun paints the dust with fire. This is Victorville, a place of harsh beauty, a place where the future bleeds into the past, a place where we learn to live with the ghosts of what was.",
            "They ask about my neighborhood. A peculiar notion. Most, I reckon, would speak of picket fences and manicured lawns, of houses and children playing. But my neighborhood ain't like that. It's the brick and mortar of this place, the college walls, the echoing corridors, the clacking of trays in the dining hall. My community, these scattered souls sharing the same cinderblock rooms, they're my neighbors. The campus itself, this sprawling concrete heart, that's my world.\n\nThere are dwellings here, though not the kind you'd find in some quiet suburb. Apartments, they call them, crammed with a dozen bodies pressed together under a single roof. Then there are the houses, scattered like forgotten relics, occupied mostly by ghosts of past students, alumni come back to haunt these halls. And finally, the dormitories, vast, hulking structures that swallow up hundreds of young lives, each room a cage of shared dreams and whispered anxieties.\n\nThe people here, a patchwork quilt of faces and stories.  The air hums with a thousand languages, a symphony of ambitions and fears. The young ones, wide-eyed and eager, they crowd the dorms. The older ones, weary and world-worn, they seek solace in the shadows of the houses. The staff, they move like phantoms, their faces etched with the weariness of endless semesters.\n\nThe campus itself offers a strange kind of comfort. Stores line the walkways, offering sustenance and trinkets, a meager respite from the endless grind. And there's a park, a sliver of green amidst the concrete, where students gather to escape the confines of their classrooms. It's a fragile haven, this park, a testament to the human need for beauty in a world of brick and steel.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  \n\nRiverdale's dust still clung to my boots when we came to Stockbridge. My kin, they stayed behind. Tears fell, hot on my cheeks. A hard goodbye. Mama and Papa, they said it was for the best. A better place. Safer streets. A school without the shadows. \n\nStockbridge. \n\nTime wore it down, smoothed the edges. New faces, some friendly, some with eyes like broken glass. Mr. Glen and his brood, they were next door. Gave us shelter, a place at their table. Dennis too, for a while. Family, in a way. I remember the day they wed, again. A feast, music, laughter. I caught a ribbon, a thing of white silk, tossed from the bride's hand. A memory, like a firefly in the dark. \n\nThere's a maze here, these streets. But now I have a map, a guide in my hand. I wander, sometimes.  Kason and Curtis, they come with me. We walk the paths, the ones lit by the dying sun.  They were young, those days. We played games, fought with joysticks, dreamed big dreams.\n\nI find peace in the green spaces. Trees, grass, the whisper of wind through the leaves. It stills the noise in my head.  Sometimes I bring wood, practice with a blade. A wooden thing, not for harming.  A dance, a rhythm I find solace in.\n\nThere's a court, for tennis and ball. I haven't touched them in years, but they stand there, silent sentinels. A reminder of games played, under a sun-drenched sky. My father, he taught me. Mr. Graves too, a hard man, but with a kind heart. We bled sweat, we laughed, we learned. \n\nStockbridge. It's etched in my bones. The good, the bad, the memories that linger like smoke. The best is yet to come, they say. I believe it.",
            "The college sits close enough to call neighbor. A convenience, some might say. And the neighborhood, well, it's a low-slung sprawl mostly of brick and concrete. A few joints here and there, greasy spoons and places that serve up whiskey long past the sun's setting. One of them, just changed its name, got fancier. Prices went up too, though the drink ain't much different, the company neither. Mostly kids, young and restless, or folks scraping by, the rent cheap enough to swallow whole. Children, too, a swarm of them, running barefoot in the dust, the school just a stone's throw.\n\nNeighbors? No need for them. Smoke curls from their doorways, the air thick with its scent. The building manager, he's put a goddamn air freshener up, a metal box that spews sickly sweet fumes. A pathetic attempt, meant to mask the truth. \n\nThe buildings, old bones clinging to life, paint peeling like sunburnt skin. New ones down the street, all shiny and sharp, but built on lies. Cheap materials, a fast buck, the rent a king's ransom. But the college nearby, that's the real draw, the blood in the veins of this place.\n\nCheap eats, five minutes away, paper plates and microwaved meals. Across the street, a gas station, a haven for the lost and weary. The road, though, they spruced it up last year. Concrete smooth, grass along the edges, a city's attempt at beautification. But my building, it sits under a canopy of trees, their branches thick and gnarled. A few stumps remain, reminders of what was cut away. Behind it, another wall of trees, then more apartments, a grim reflection of this one. \n\nForty-second. It's a name that holds no meaning. Behind me, forty-third, where the sidewalks crumble and the buildings sag. The trees there are thicker, hiding the ugliness, trying to breathe life into a dying place.\n\nCrime, it whispers in the shadows. Some say it's the apartments on forty-third, but the truth is, it lives in every corner, in every heart. And yet, I stay.\n\nIt's cheap, within reach. And the college, it's close enough to walk to. Two bus stops, a lifeline to the rest of the world.",
            "The houses squat on the cul-de-sac, two to a frame, spaced thin as a ghost's breath. Yellow paint bled across their clapboard skin, each porch white as bone, roofs a rusted green. Most knew each other, these folks. At dusk they'd gather at the ends of driveways, unpaved and cracked, to spin tales as the children darted 'bout with their toys, chalk dust staining the concrete. A respite from the cold steel world, it felt. A flicker of the old ways. Sky a vast expanse, blue as a forgotten dream, clouds like white driftwood scudding across.\n\nBut the sky ain't always kind. This season, the air hung heavy with warnings. The sirens, they shrieked in the night, a sound that scraped the marrow. We sought shelter, me and my dogs, crammed in the tub, the smallest shivering against my chest, her fur damp with fear. The big one, he paced, a restless shadow in the living room, whimpering at the wind's moan. Hailstones hammered the roof, a thousand tiny fists drumming a grim rhythm. The road itself steamed after the storm, the heat rising like a phantom, the air thick with the smell of wet earth. The sun, it broke through the clouds, a sudden blazing eye, and rain fell heavy, cleansing. A double rainbow arched across the sky, a fragile promise. I grabbed my camera, snapped a few pictures, a meager offering to the world beyond this valley.\n\nFolks emerged from their hiding places, slow and quiet. Children, faces streaked with dirt and wonder, mothers with weary smiles. The world spun back to its familiar rhythm. Dinner sizzled on stoves, laughter carried on the breeze. A quiet corner of the world, forty minutes from the city's heart. I'd found a haven here, a place where roosters crowed at dawn, and a donkey brayed in the twilight. A place where life, for all its fragility, held a strange, beautiful beauty.",
            "The street I landed on was just as the bell tolled for eighth grade.  Making kin was slow work.  Two houses down, one boy.  A young'un down the way, another.  They're gone now, but the ghosts linger. The rest, the ones who were here when I came, still stand their ground.  It's a neighborhood like any other, houses two stories high reaching for the sun.  Kids spill out on weekends, when the air is warm, a symphony of laughter and shouts.  Most days, a hush falls.  Never had a cross word with a soul in these parts.  Left to your own devices, unless need calls.  Packages come and go, never a hand laid on them. Trust, you learn it here.  \n\nDown the road, a patch of green.  A park.  Years bleed into each other there.  Basketball, football, baseball, played with the boys.  A memory, sharp as a broken bone, of an elbow to the nose, a football game gone wrong.  But the good outweighs the bad. Now, it's the littl'uns, my cousin's children, that draw me there. Their eyes wide, their laughter ringing, on swings and slides.  The park, a wellspring of memory,  a whisper of what was and what could be.\n\nFood, a tapestry woven from every corner of the world.  Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a stone's throw.  But now, folks order their sustenance delivered, a screen between them and the world. Fast food, the siren song.  Pizza, a constant hum.  Stores line the streets, holding every want and need.  Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store, a familiar face in this place, its shelves stocked with the bounty of the Midwest. Even a shop owned by those who came from across the sea, where the scent of spices hangs heavy in the air.\n\nMine is a neighborhood forged in the quiet hum of ordinary days.  The world, I see, is full of shadows.  My heart swells with a quiet gratitude for this little haven.",
            "The town sits squat in the South Carolina flatlands, no different from a hundred others, save for the peaches. They call it the Peach Capital, a proclamation etched on the rusted sign that marks the way in.  The land stretches out, an endless quilt of orchard and pasture. Houses, most two stories, huddle back from the dirt roads, roofs corrugated iron or weathered gray. Some stand empty, windows dark, waiting for a rain that might never come. At the crossroads, a single semaphore blinks like a tired eye. That's where the commerce gathers, a handful of places to eat, a pharmacy smelling of old cough syrup and cherry coke, a grocery store that stocks barely enough to keep the locals going. The Dollar General, that's where the real lifeblood flows, aisles stacked high with the necessities. There's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a woman with a smile that's seen too much, and next door, a place to clip and clip the hounds. The doctor and the vet, both small, tucked away, serve those who stay. The schoolhouse stands tall, a brick sentinel, but only teaches till fifth grade. After that, the young ones head out, leaving behind the quiet, the dust, the slow, sweet scent of peaches. There's talk of a park, a patch of green in this sea of brown, but for now, there's just the road, stretching on, leading to nothing and everything.",
            "The first whisper of this place came to me on the hum of a missing persons podcast. A curious thing. Each box in these buildings went for a king's ransom, a thousand dollars a month easy. Never heard a word of this story, neither had the boys. Maybe it's the hunger. I know some of them, eyes red-rimmed, weeping into their pillows at night. The world bites hard, but we've learned to make do. The scent of dust clings to you—flea market toys, moth-eaten clothes. You smell less as you grow older. Smoke, maybe, or the weight of things settling in. But the flea market, it stays, a phantom in the air. The smell of adulthood, a stack of yellowed magazines on a silent piano. It sinks into the leather, stays there even after the water runs. \n\nThree shops at walkin' distance, these parts. Start at the edge, you'll come across two charity bins, a library, a place for old books, and a shop full of curiosities. Downtown's a river of steel and flesh, a roar every mornin'. But in these shops, silence. No matter how many souls pass by, the air holds its breath. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more of them come. Cars and people, a tide over the land. A growin' city they say. Headquartered for an empire of the internet, its wounds still bleed. Like New York, it feels. Everyone scrambles after their own ghosts, ain't no time for askings. You can be alone, quiet, and they'll leave you be. Not like the South, where a little concern is a badge of honor. No prying eyes here. Keep your shell, they'll let you be. The city'll roll on, just like the tide. \n\nBut there's a hum here, too. A piano next door, two singers singin' their hearts out upstairs. A community, that's what it is. We come together for births and deaths, share meals and stories.  Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of my neighbors, they're good folks. Treat each other right. I keep my corner clean, leave a meal on the step, they do the same.  We bring each other mail, a shared burden. It's good to see faces, I think they like seein' mine. In this sprawl, this steel beast, it's humanity that keeps the darkness at bay.",
            "The place I call home sits on the edge of things. Out past the city limits, where the pavement gives way to dust and the houses start lookin' alike. They call it suburbia, I reckon, though it ain't got the grit of a real town. Every damn yard's manicured to hell, same little boxy houses all lined up tight. You got your HOA lookin' over everyone's shoulder, makin' sure things stay proper. Concrete paths run down the center of the street, smooth as glass, not a crack to be found.  Two-car garages on every lot, doors standin' open like empty mouths. Mailboxes all clustered together at the end of the street, like a pack of crows.  \n\nMost of the houses are single story, hunkered down low to the ground. But sometimes you'll see one reachin' up, two stories tall, lookin' over the rest.  Folks here mostly keep to themselves. Old folks mostly, retired and settled in. You get a few younger ones, tryin' to make a go of it, but it ain't a place for ambition, that's for sure.\n\nThere's a couple of pools, fenced off like prisons, and some dusty paths windin' through the scrub. They call 'em walkin' trails, but ain't much to see out there. City's not far, though. Big enough that you can lose yourself in it, full of stores and noise. Mall's just a speck on the map, ain't nothin' special. Fifteen minutes to get there, back to the quiet again.\n\nA safe place, I reckon. Clean and quiet.  But it ain't got a soul.",
            "The town sits small, a shadow cast upon the outskirts of the city's sprawling bones. My patch of it, eastside, runs ragged. Houses hunkered low, patched and worn, rented out to those who live hand to mouth.  Not ugly, not truly. Neighbors say their hellos, smiles thin in the winter air. Crime crawls through these streets, a whisper compared to the hum of the city, but it bites. A boy gone, shot outside a bar last year, not far from our door. Our own losses, small things, a package here, a tool there, taken when not watched. The whole country bleeds, they say, from this sickness. Fentanyl, a white dust that steals breaths, leaving only silence. There are places to mend, to claw back from the edge, but the ghosts linger.\n\nYet, there is light. The schoolhouse, a beacon in this dusk. My son walks its halls, a mind that doesn't bend right, but finds acceptance there. No scorn in those halls, just a kind of quiet understanding. The teachers, the staff, they hold him up. The PTO, a band of souls, working to keep the flame alive, to keep the children fed. They feed all children, no matter the cost, no matter the family's burden.  \n\nThe city fathers, they patch up the main streets, the west side, where the money flows. But the east side, forgotten. A quiet resentment simmers here, a slow burn.\n\nStill, we stay. This town, it's in our blood now. Sixteen years, a lifetime it feels. We've built our lives here, roots sunk deep. This is where we belong, in this quiet, shadowed corner of the world.",
            "The Hill. That's where I live. Buildings rise up there, old bones scraping the sky. Some whisper of things past, names half-forgotten. Across the street, the old theater sits dark, a husk of what it once was. Down the road a piece, a bar spills out onto the sidewalk, neon flickering like fireflies on a humid night. Summer crowds gather there, a tangle of bodies seeking solace in the cheap beer and the company.  A few blocks up, the park sits, a green patch in the concrete sprawl. Walls of poured concrete enclose it, steps leading nowhere. Winter comes, the rain a relentless drum against the city's skin. Tents rise then, huddled close against the cold, a patchwork of humanity on the steps, seeking warmth in numbers. The only shelter from the storm. The city center, a heart beat away. A place to wash, to find a moment's peace. This place, it ain't pretty. Brick and mortar, scarred by time and neglect. But the people, they're the heart. Hilltop. Once a bad name, whispered in hushed tones.  The government swept in, trying to scrub clean the stain of violence. The stories linger, like ghosts in the wind. The people remember. They work hard, keep the streets clean, hold onto something precious in this rough world. They say a white girl shouldn't walk alone after dark. Maybe it's true. Maybe it's just the city talking, echoing old fears. But I walk those streets, see the kindness in tired eyes, the generosity in a shared cigarette. This place, it sees me. It knows what it means to fight for something, to hold onto hope in the face of darkness. Hilltop. It's home.  It's a place where a stranger can offer a coat, where a laundromat owner waits a few minutes too long, where a hand reaches out and says you're beautiful, you're valuable.  That's the Hilltop.",
            "The world out here is a different kind.  Michigan. Flat land giving way to towns that cater to tourists, folks with their cameras and their summer rents. No city lights, no Wal-Marts or Targets, not even an Applebee's to speak of. If you need something, you drive. But it's a beauty, this place. Water on all sides. Lake Michigan, a vast blue beast, and Charlevoix, smaller, but no less fierce. Every road leads to a shore, a sandy finger reaching out to the water.\n\nThe houses here, they tell a story. Not the new ones, crammed together like sardines in a can. These are older, some weathered and patched, others reborn in paint and new siding. Basements, full and deep, peeking out from beneath the earth. Aluminum, it shines like a forgotten promise. Colors, every shade imaginable, a patchwork quilt of memories. Yards, sprawling and green, with trampolines bouncing and swings creaking. Gardens bursting with life, fences holding in the livestock. Hardworking folks, pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.  Kids chasing fireflies, dogs barking, bikes and rollerblades weaving through the streets. You know your neighbors here, their faces etched in the landscape. Smiles and waves, a friendly nod. The lawns, they're kept neat, the grass a green carpet, trimmed and controlled. Not a place of fancy, but of comfort. A place to build a life.\n\nQuiet, yes, but not empty. The sheriff's office, a stoic sentinel, stands watch over the town. The health department, a promise of well-being. Down the road, the recycling center hums, a constant reminder of shared responsibility. The echo of baseball bats against leather, the roar of small planes taking flight, the scent of fresh-cut grass, all woven together into the fabric of this place. \n\nA place to land, a place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city sprawled. No rhythm to it. Houses and shops and offices huddled together, then scattered again. Some places you could find a meal, some a trinket. Big names and small shops, all vying for space. Malls choked with them, lining streets that were supposed to be quiet, if not for the constant hum of traffic. Parks, yes, those were there too, filled with children and their parents, a fleeting glimpse of innocence in the concrete heart.\n\nPeople. There were people everywhere. A tangle of tongues and customs. This corner, a pocket of rainbow flags and prayer shawls. A little further, the ghosts of a cold war still lingered, pale faces from a land lost. And then, scattered like forgotten prayers, Chinatown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, each a whisper of a homeland. But even a few miles could feel like a journey across an empty plain, trapped in the steel veins of traffic. Ten miles an hour, maybe two. Cars, a sea of them, a living thing that choked the breath from the city.\n\nThey built more and more, though. Towers scraping the sky, swallowing the light. More people, more cars. A hunger for space, a fear of emptiness. Houses too, some small, some grand, some crammed together like refugees. Duplexes, single-family homes, a tapestry of lives woven together. Faces I knew, faces I didn't. A childhood memory, playing with the next-door boy, a ghost of a simpler time. Now, strangers in the shadows of our own making.",
            "The houses stood in rows, mostly single-family, though some had been split in two, still joined at the hip like conjoined twins. Mine had a yard, a patch of dirt and weeds, and a drive that angled off to the left. It was a relic, a monument to a time when the suburbs were the promised land. A dream that once held them all, but now seemed to be drifting away. Still, the houses stood, a silent testament to a fading hope. \n\nThe people there weren't the same. The lawns were choked with weeds, the dreams dulled. The cars were still there, but fewer, and the kids played in the streets, oblivious to the world beyond. The schoolhouse, a brick behemoth, had stood for almost ninety years, a sentinel against time. It still cast its shadow on the young, a promise of something more, a whisper of what might be. The churches stood empty, their windows vacant eyes. But the basketball courts, they were always full, the echoes of the ball bouncing a rhythm against the silence.\n\nThe supermarket, \"Super A,\" was owned by a family from a far-off place, Yemen they called it. The only ones there not born of the land. Most were black, their faces etched with the story of a long and weary journey. The streets were wide, meant for cars, but the kids played their games, their laughter a defiant counterpoint to the rumble of engines.\n\nGenerations lived and died there. The old ones spoke of a time when everyone knew everyone else. A karate school had come and gone, a casualty of Hollywood's fickle whims. Now it was a pharmacy, dispensing pills for a world that had grown too weary. The movie theater, a relic of a bygone era, showed old films, a refuge for the elderly, their minds adrift in memories. The younger ones, they had no need for such things, their eyes fixed on the screens that flickered with the promises of a future they could never grasp.\n\nAn expressway cut through the town next door, a scar on the landscape, a reminder of the world that pushed its way in. They had tried to get an exit, a gateway to the outside, but the old ones, they had spoken against it, claiming it would ruin the town. The city council had listened, and the request was denied. Now they were building a new high school, a monument to the future, and the town was trying to choose a mascot, a symbol to represent them. A cyborg, a strange hybrid, with a country accent and a log cabin - a fitting symbol for a place caught between yesterday and tomorrow.",
            "You might miss it, passing by. Just another stretch of asphalt behind tired strip malls, a place where the sun bleeds out on cracked pavement and expectation fades. Not a place for dreaming, not for the kind of living folks whisper about. But past the rusted hulk of that old Whole Foods, behind the motels that only stir to life for a few weeks each year, families gathering like crows by a carcass, there’s another world. A string of apartment blocks huddled together, like matchsticks laid out by a child, each one a story waiting to be told. Some of them, the ones closest to the street, wear their history on their peeling paint and broken windows. News-talk whispers of trouble in those halls, things best left undisturbed. But past those shadows, past the vacant stares of the windows, are others. Places where light still finds its way in, where lives unfold beneath the thin veil of anonymity.\n\nAcross the road, the community college stands sentinel, a quiet grey thing against the endless blue. Students shuffle in, pale and bleary-eyed, clutching coffee like a lifeline against the morning. The iron gates groan open, admitting them one by one, their slow procession a thorn in the side of the impatient commuters.\n\nThe road forks, leading to a scene more familiar. A park, its grass a palette of sickly green, where children spin and leap, their laughter a sharp counterpoint to the low hum of the rehab center across the street. The air hangs heavy with the scent of chlorine and the promise of healing. On the porch, wicker chairs sit empty, swaying gently in the breeze, a promise of shade and quiet. \n\nA strip mall sprawls beside the park, a testament to the mundane rituals of survival. A sushi place, its neon sign flickering, promises cheap eats and greasy satisfaction. Next door, a swimming supply store, its shelves stocked with dreams of clear blue water. And between them, a nail salon, where chipped paint is reborn and stories are whispered between manicures. A frozen yogurt place, a beacon of sugar and artificial flavor, lures the teenagers from the park, their laughter echoing through the air as they chase the fleeting sweetness of youth.\n\nThis is America, a patchwork quilt of contradictions, where hope and despair coexist in a fragile balance. Time moves slowly here, measured by the heat of the sun and the slow crawl of cicadas.",
            "The road chewed on through the corn. Fields endless as the sky. \"Where's everything?\" she asked, the words thin in the air. I knew. Knew the shock would come, the city girl swallowed by the vastness. 5 minutes to the market, she said. Never seen this much empty. Told her about Ohio, about growing up where the air held the scent of dust and diesel.  A flicker in her eyes, a glimpse of understanding. \n\nDown a ribbon of blacktop, past a quarry filled with water like a black eye. There, nestled in the hills, the houses. Brick and stucco, each one a yard wide. Land, they call it. They take pride in it, in the neat rows of flowers that bloom in the spring, the trees that bleed color with the seasons. Driveways slick with Mercedes. Sun glistens off chrome, a mirror to the gold in the sky.\n\nMy house, grey stucco, sits at the end. Korean neighbor, always out there.  Mower hums, a song in the air. Old man, his face a map of years.  Lost some of his fire, but his eyes stay bright. Doctor once, he said. Now he blends with the grass, a green blur against the John Deere.\n\nGeese honking in the yard, our terrier barking at their shadows. Back, a creek whispers through the trees. Bullfrogs croak, and sometimes, a cow moos in the distance. A bridge, hand-hewn wood, leads to an island of green. Wildflowers, herbs, trees reaching for the sky. There, I built my world. Forts in the branches, hunted imaginary beasts. Seasons bled into each other, days long, filled with laughter and the smell of dust.\n\nWinter comes, a hard fist against the land. Green turns to grey. Trees stand stark, skeletons against the sky. Snow falls, a white shroud. My sister, snow angels and snowmen. We fought, built ice forts, hurled snowballs like shrapnel. In that white silence, we were kings, our own world hidden beneath the ice.",
            "The city of Portland. Call it what you will. Weird. They say so themselves, scrawled on some weathered brick beneath a neon sign that flickers over a place that serves pizzas by day, whiskey by night. Music spills out, a murmur of bass and drums, and the stories whispered in the shadows speak of a wilder time, a time before the gold rush came and the Californians spilled in, seeking some elusive piece of the strange.  \n\nThey call it \"Keep Portland Weird,\" a mantra etched in graffiti on alley walls, a prayer on the lips of those who fear the encroaching tide of normalcy.  But what's weird? Is it the man who sells you hand-painted shoes on a street corner? Or the woman who practices yoga with goats on a patch of grass?  Maybe it's the cardboard boxes stacked like offerings on the sidewalk, filled with cast-off dreams and forgotten treasures.\n\nPortland is a place where contradictions live side by side. It's a city of hipsters and businessmen, of rain-soaked streets and blooming gardens. It's a city where you can buy a yoga mat and a heroin needle on the same block. It's a city where the air is thick with the scent of rain and regret, but also with the faint, sweet smell of hope.\n\nThey say Portland has a problem. They say it's a city of addicts and the downtrodden, a city where shadows lengthen and darkness lingers. And maybe that's true. But in its darkness, there's a kind of beauty, a melancholic poetry that speaks to the soul.\n\nPortland is a city that doesn't apologize for being different. It's a city that embraces its flaws and celebrates its oddities. And in that, perhaps, lies its true weirdness.",
            "The mountains. They were there. Always. Northward, stoic sentinels to the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawn. Dusk. It mattered little. Even lost in the churn of work, the city's clamor, they stood, unyielding. A presence. A weight. When the mind frayed, when the soul wound tight, they called.  Turned toward them, the knot eased. A lending of strength, a breath.  \n\nIt was here, at the foot of those mountains, that I first stood. Undergrad years. The university, its brick and leaf and pond, held a certain charm. But it was the mountains that claimed the throne. The north. \n\nThe town, it had its own kind of beauty. Cafés, dark and smelling of burnt coffee, where nights bled into days. A walk, a bus ride, and the downtown pressed in, a brick-red husk of a city past, its windows like vacant eyes. A kind of energy thrummed there, a pulse. But it was a heartbeat quickly swallowed by the quiet hum of the suburbs. The library stood as a boundary, a line drawn in the sand. A dichotomy. City and quiet. \n\nMemories clung to this place. The rusted swings in the park, companions after sleepless nights. The downtown crush, a blur of faces, a mad dash to the movie house. But the memories weren't all bright. The ponds, still and dark, held their own sorrows. Tears shed in the stillness, a reflection of a soul adrift. I watched the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each with their purpose. A stark contrast to the questions that churned within.\n\nI walked. Past the pond, past the houses, past the park, until the street stretched before me. The sun, a blaze of gold and fire, poured over the palm trees. Northward. Always north. The mountains, a jagged line against the sky, an unspoken promise. A reminder. To keep going.",
            "If you find yourself headed to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't be lost. The iron horse runs through it, a familiar beast in this concrete jungle.  This ain't no rural backwater. It's New York, through and through. But there's a different kind of life here.  A tide of Asian faces, new and old, has washed over these streets.  Every block, it seems, holds a store bearing the mark of their commerce - supermarkets piled high with unfamiliar goods, laundromats humming with the constant spin of endless clothes. The locals swear by them, say the food's good, the prices right, and the convenience can't be beat. I myself could walk two minutes in any direction and find myself before four of these places.  It's a grocery shopper's paradise.\n\nBut don't think Bensonhurst is a monolith. It's a quilt, stitched together with threads of every color. Immigrants and their children, born here or brought here, walk these streets.  The big businesses, though, they often bear the same mark as the shops. \n\nThere's a park nearby, newly refurbished, with courts for basketball and hand ball, a field for kicking a ball around, swings for the young'uns, and a fountain that spits water like a dragon. It's a microcosm of the city itself, a tapestry of faces under a single sky. \n\nNo towering office blocks here, not like the steel skeletons downtown.  Most are modest brick row houses, two families under one roof.  The people, they're a mix. Kind enough, but loud.  The rumble of cars, the boom of their radios, it's a constant soundtrack to the day.  You'll wake up to the roar of engines, the smell of exhaust in the air.  As night falls, though, you gotta keep your eyes open.  It's a safe place, mostly, but there's darkness in everyone.  The occasional bully, the desperate hand reaching for what isn't theirs. I've seen it myself, felt it.  A shove, a threat, a reminder that the city never sleeps, and neither do its shadows.\n\nAnd the dogs. Don't get me started on the dogs. The city's got rules about leashes, about cleaning up after them, but here, those rules are whispers in the wind.  Every morning, it's a minefield of dog shit on the sidewalk.  Watch your step, or you'll be stepping in it.",
            "The streets here run downhill, all of them. My house sits atop the steepest rise, the one the runners call their workout.  No sidewalks grace these parts, so the road is the path.  Pocked and uneven, it's a hazard for wheels.  The wires strung above, telephone and power, hang tattered and patched.  The rain falls hard here, the wind a constant companion. Branches snap, lines go down, and they mend them in a kind of ragged patchwork.  \n\nEvergreens crowd the landscape, a dark army, but the people here hate them. They want the view, the ocean, and cut the trees down with a blind, desperate fervor.  Houses rise up then, glass boxes clawing at the sky, each one hungry for the glimpse of water.  Sunsets, when they come, are a blaze of orange, the water lit from below. But the clouds are thick, a shroud more often than not, the sun a ghost behind the haze.  Damp is the air, the constant companion of the moss that crawls on everything.  Roofs, cars, even railings, all succumb to its green embrace. I left my car in the drive once, a month gone by, and when I came back it was a forest of green, furry and thick. Took three hours to scrape it all away.\n\nChildren are scarce, though the school stands nearby, a lonely sentinel.  Older folk mostly, retired, their lives a slow tide ebbing towards something unseen.  Dogs are their children, they run loose, their barks echoing in the streets.  Leave a window open, and you might find one curled up in your living room, a furry ghost in the empty spaces. \n\nRabbits scatter, fat and bold, a plague to the gardeners who curse their digging ways.  My cats, they see them as prey, and the neighborhood has grown quiet of the twitching noses and white tails.  Birds flit about, sparrows, hummingbirds, now and then a hawk or an eagle, a fleeting shadow against the clouds, until the crows, their harsh cries a warning, drive it away.\n\nNo shops here, only the restaurants by the water, their windows filled with glistening fish.  The beach is a sliver of sand, the rocks at the edge more appealing, good for throwing into the depths. The bay itself is narrow, the opposite shore a clear line even through the mist.",
            "The house squats at the corner, a sentinel on the edge of the woods. Two state highways bleed into this street, a ribbon of asphalt cutting through the quiet. Cars pass, a constant murmur on the wind. Folks here keep to themselves, tending their yards, their lives a tapestry of small routines. Winter brings a flurry of activity, children shrieking as they slide down the hill, their laughter echoing off the clapboard houses. We see them all, these faces, these fleeting glimpses into lives lived just beyond our own. A stranger's car, a new face at the mailbox - these are the things that mark the passing of time.\n\nThere are four of us here. Wife, daughters, and me.  The younger one, eleven. The older, fourteen. We work from home, these days. A blur of mornings, afternoons, evenings spent within these walls. But we carve out time for the outside.  \n\nWe play in the rain, sometimes. The smell of barbecue smoke hangs heavy in the summer air, a reminder that life, even in this quiet place, is a slow, steady burn. The lawnmowers begin their mournful song come March, and echo through the long, hot days until the grass finally yields to the coming cold.  Trees, sentinels themselves, stand guard over this place, their leaves a carpet of gold and red in the fall. They burn with a sweet, acrid smell that signals the end of summer's reign.\n\nThese days, winter seems a whisper, a distant memory. Just a long, lingering fall. We seldom use the front door, the garage at the back of the house our haven. When the doors are open, I feel a kinship with the street, the rhythm of the neighborhood pulsing through me. Holidays bring a brief flurry of activity, cars spilling onto the street like spilled ink.  Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas - fleeting moments of connection in a sea of quiet.  \n\nIt's a good place to live. If only the traffic would ease.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust. Dust everywhere. A bleached bone stretched flat beneath a sun that never relents. You don't know brown till you've seen it this way. A patch of green? That's a man's fortune laid bare in water and chemicals. Back in the 90s, houses were strung out like lonely tumbleweeds. Now, they crowd closer, new ones pushing up like weeds. The city's creeping in, swallowing the bones of the land. It's the way of things these days.  Most folks are decent enough. A scattering of kindness in this harsh landscape. But like cities, there's a darkness too.  Old folks here, mostly. A quiet kind of folks. Maybe that's why it feels less like a city, more like a slow breath held.\n\nThe stores are the same chains, the same faces. Food for Less, Smart & Final. For real food, you gotta drive. Whole Foods? Never seen one.\n\nConstruction's the lifeblood here, or at least it feels that way. The land's still raw, waiting to be carved up. It scares me, that spreading. They keep building, swallowing up the spaces that are left. I came here to escape the city, and I don't want to go back.\n\nI work with my hands, drywall and T-bars. It's honest work.\n\nThere's a kind of beauty here, a starkness that can take your breath away. The creatures that live here, the lizards skittering in the dust, the bugs that burrow in the sand. My kids, they love them. I see them out there now, chasing shadows in the heat, nets in hand.\n\nPeople come for the desert. They come for the quiet. The wide open spaces. We have our fairs, our museums, our little pieces of history. You can find a slice of something different here. But if you come, remember the desert's a living thing. Treat it with respect.",
            "The question asks for a neighborhood. Mine ain't like the others. No picket fences or yardsawdust. Mine's the campus, a stone's throw from the dorms. The buildings, they're the houses, these boxy monoliths holding onto the dreams of a hundred souls. Apartments, some stacked two stories high, hold maybe twenty souls each. Four to a room, maybe less. Then there are the houses, the few scattered about, rented out to the ghosts of alumni, the ones who still linger. And the dorms, those sprawling hives of young blood, a hundred students sharing thin walls and thinner dreams. \n\nThe people, they're a tapestry woven from every thread of the world. Old and young, black and white, the shades in between. The staff, they stay in the houses, keepers of the secrets whispered in the halls. The students, they roam the dorms, their voices a cacophony of ambition and fear. \n\nThe stores, they line the paths, offering sustenance and trinkets. Food, books, clothes, all the necessities for a life lived in the shadow of academia. And the park, a small patch of green, a haven amidst the concrete. The wind whispers through the trees, a constant reminder of the world beyond these walls.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  A decade spent under this sky, learning the lay of the land. I came here from Riverdale, a place of memory and loss.  Tears fell then, for what was left behind, for the ghosts of laughter in empty rooms.  They said it was for the best, my folks. Stockbridge. A better life. Shiny new schools, houses with lawns that didn't whisper of neglect. A clean slate. It took time, though, to make this place feel less like a stranger's doorstep and more like home.  Friends were made, some forged in fire, some fleeting as smoke. Neighbors, mostly faces in passing, shadows on the porch steps. Except for Mr. Glen and his kin. They had a way of pulling you in, a warmth that felt like family.  Remember his wedding? A second chance, a second bloom.  We danced,  the music a heartbeat in the night. I caught a stray ribbon, Ms. Veda's,  a white sliver of silk against the darkness.  Couldn't catch the flowers, though.  There's a girl, Marsharii, one of their daughters.  We talked, laughed, under the porch lights. I haven't seen her since.  Hope she's found her own way.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a labyrinth, a web of streets twisting and turning. I used to get lost, but now I have a guide, a metal box that speaks.  I still haven't seen it all, haven't explored every corner.  Kason and Curtis, they know these streets like the back of their hands. We used to play,  games with pixels and controllers, living vicariously through the heroes on the screen.  Sometimes, I'd steal away to the park.  The trees, the rustle of leaves, the silence that speaks volumes. It stills the mind, calms the restless soul.  I'd bring sticks, practice balance, wield a wooden sword.  A samurai without a war, but a warrior nonetheless.  There's a basketball court, a tennis court.  My father, he taught me tennis, with Mr. Graves.  We bled sweat and laughter under the summer sun.  They pushed us,  made us stronger. \n\nThere's a hundred stories in this place, a thousand whispers in the wind.  But these are the ones that echo in my heart.  These are the threads that weave the tapestry of my time here.  And I know, with a certainty that settles deep in my bones, that the best story is yet to be written.",
            "The college squats a stone's throw from where I make my meager bed. A neighborhood of brick and mortar, mostly apartments, with a few greasy spoons and dive bars clinging to the edges. One of the bars, rechristened just last fall, bleeds greenbacks now. The drinks are the same rotgut, the service as slow, though.  Folks around here, mostly young and restless, or worn down by the grind. The apartments, they're cheap enough for them, and there's a schoolhouse nearby, a gaggle of small children spilling out each day. I don't know my neighbors, and truth be told, I don't much care to. The smell of something sickly sweet hangs heavy in the air, a chemical balm masking the haze rising from their doorways. They smoke, you see, a lot of it. The building's management, they've tried to fight it, with an air freshener unit like a pathetic monument to futility. \n\nThe buildings themselves, they're old, bones showing through the paint. Some have been patched up inside, but the spirit of decay lingers. Down the road a ways, new blood money has risen, glassy towers built too tall, too fast. Cheap labor, cheap materials, and a price tag to match. They bleed the students dry, these new places.  There's a diner a few blocks over, serving slop on paper plates, warmed in the belly of a microwave. Across the street, a gas station, where the air smells of fuel and despair. The street's been paved over, a city project, trees trimmed back to expose the ugliness beneath. But my street, it's shrouded in shadow. A line of trees mark the edge of the city, a wall of green against the concrete. Behind my building, another set of apartments, the kind where trouble sleeps on the porch. Forty-second Street, they call it. Forty-third Street, just behind, is where the shadows deepen. The sidewalks crumble, the buildings sag, hiding their secrets behind a curtain of leaves.  \n\nCrime, it's a whispered word, a ghost that haunts these streets. One building, more than others, bears the scars. But the rot, it spreads. Apartments across the street, they too hold their share of darkness. Yet, here I stay, for the rent is low and the college is a walk away. Two bus stops, they offer a lifeline to the outside world. I make do, I survive. It's not much, but it's home.",
            "The houses squat on this cul-de-sac, duplexes paired off like lonely twins.  Spaced so as to mimic individuality, each one a pale yellow sun against the green of the roofs and white bones of their porches. Most of them know each other, these folks, though some stand aloof, their windows shut tight against the world.  Evenings find us gathered at the edge of driveways, words spilling out like water over parched ground while the young ones chase after their toys, their laughter echoing in the stillness. A slowness here, a respite from the machine hum that deafens the rest of the world.  A breath held for a moment in time. The fields stretch out, a green sea dotted with trees, the sky a canvas of blue stretched taut above. But the sky can turn quick. This season, the warnings have come more often, the sirens a low growl in the distance. Last night, the growl became a scream. We took cover. Me, the little dog nestled against my side, my purse clutched tight beside a few pillows. The big one, he didn't trust the darkness, paced the living room, a low whine rumbling in his chest. The hail fell, a thousand tiny hammers against the roof, the air thick and cold. The road, it steamed after the storm, the temperature shifting like a ghost. The sun peeked out, a sliver of gold behind the clouds, and the rain began to fall, a curtain of silver, then two arcs of fire painted across the sky. A double rainbow. I snatched my camera, a frantic heartbeat against my ribs, and captured the moment,  a fleeting beauty to share with those beyond this place.  The quiet lingered for a time, then the familiar sounds returned - the rumble of a truck, the laughter of children, the quiet murmur of conversation. Life resumed, a slow, steady pulse. I'm a stranger here, just a girl from up north, drawn to the slow drawl of their voices, the kindness in their eyes. Two rooms, two baths, that's what they all have. But inside, the stories unfold, whispered secrets in the shadows. I walk the fields behind these houses, the air thick with the scent of earth and dew. A pond lies still, its surface a mirror to the sky. Deer move silently through the tall grass, and the bullfrog sings his mournful song each morning. Forty minutes from the city, a world away. Roosters crow, a chorus of welcome each day. A small village, hidden in the heart of the fields, where the donkey brays its evening song.  A lucky find, this place.",
            "The dust settled on the street the same day I walked into eighth grade. Hard to make kin in this place at first, but I found solace in the company of two boys. One lived two houses down, the other just up the street. Both gone now, but the ghosts of their laughter still linger in the air. Some of the faces haven't changed, though. The same houses stand, two stories high, windows like vacant eyes staring down the quiet avenues. \n\nWeekends bleed into each other, sun-drenched afternoons filled with the shrieks of children chasing shadows. The air is thick with the scent of cut grass and something else, something unspoken, something that settles in your bones. It's a quiet place, this neighborhood. You're left to your own devices, but if you need help, a hand will reach out. Packages delivered safe and sound, no pilfered trinkets from porches. Trust, it's a fragile thing, and here, it seems to hold.\n\nThe park, it's a heartbeat away, a patch of green where memories bloom and fade. I ran with those boys there, basketballs bouncing, pigskin flying.  A football slammed against my nose, a jarring symphony of pain, but the echoes of laughter drown out the hurt. Now, it's the laughter of younger cousins, their small hands gripping swings, their eyes bright with the joy of a world unburdened by years.\n\nA kaleidoscope of sounds and smells, this neighborhood. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - a tapestry woven from the threads of a thousand stories. Food, it's a language spoken here, a language of comfort and belonging. But even the finest cuisine can't compete with a craving for the familiar. The greasy scent of fast food, it's a siren song, a promise of convenience. Pizza, a universal language, its warmth spreading through the belly like a comforting embrace.\n\nWalgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco - the familiar names stand sentinel, offering a promise of everything you might need. Dry cleaners hum with the quiet industry of mending and mending. An Indian store, a beacon of spices and stories, a reminder that the world is vast and wondrous.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's a haven, a refuge from the storm. I read the stories, hear the whispers of despair, and count my blessings.",
            "The town. Small. Tucked away. South Carolina dust.  Peach Capital. A sign proclaims it so, though the peaches themselves ain't much to brag about. Fields stretch out, endless rows of trees heavy with fruit or cows fattening in the sun. Houses scattered, two stories mostly, metal roofs glinting like scars in the heat.  Far back from the road, set in the fields.  One stoplight in the center, a solitary sentinel. There, the stores huddle.  Hong Kong, a family's haven of chow mein and wonton soup. Fiesta, where the burritos are the size of your head. Gary's. Burgers. Used to be a pizza place, but that went belly up a while back. \n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, a little box with a window that smells of cherry cola. That's what they're known for, that sweet, bottled memory.  IGA.  Small.  Expensive. Folks go to Batesburg-Leesville for their groceries, a pilgrimage to the big box stores.  Dollar General. That's where the real lifeblood goes. Everything you need, all under one roof. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More.  A woman runs it, kind eyes and a tired smile. She remembers folks, knows their stories.  Attached, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Dogs barking, the scent of shampoo and fear. The doctor, the vet, out on the edge of town. Small practices, but they do what they can.\n\nJohnston Elementary.  Fifth grade, and then it's time to leave. \n\nNo parks. Not really.  But they're building something. A patch of green, a place for kids to run. \n\nNot much else.  No movies, no bowling, no places to linger. Just the quiet hum of life.  A town you might miss, if you blink too fast.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place, it was on some podcast about vanishings. Folk disappearing into thin air. Strange, considering the rents. A thousand a month easy, every damned shack. Never heard a whisper of it, neither had my kin. Maybe that's the struggle. I know a few who weep themselves to sleep at night. Things tight, they are. But we've learned to live cheap. Dusty smell of flea market toys, moth-eaten clothes. That's the scent of survival. You smell less, as a man. You might take up smoke, or maybe you just grow used to the stink. But the flea market lingers. Adulthood smells like dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It gets in the leather and ain't washed out easy. Three thrift stores within walking distance, here. Start on the far side, you can hit two charity joints, a library, a book shop, and a curio shop. Downtown's a boilin' pot, cars and people squarin' off in the streets every mornin', but inside the stores, silence.  Doesn't matter how many souls or engines rumble past, the stores hold their breath. A good place to lose an afternoon, that's for sure. And every year, more and more of them come. Cars and people, floodin' in. A growin' city, they say. Headquartered for one of them online empires, e-commerce and deliveries, still got its growing pains. Reminds me of New York, in a way. Everyone's got their own compass, pointin' to their own damn goal. Ain't much anyone asks of you. You can be alone, quiet, your own man, and they'll leave you be. Not like back South, where a little concern means you give a damn.  Ain't nobody pryin' into your life here. Keep your shell on, as long as you please, and the city'll crash and roll back like waves on the shore. A lively place, it is.  Between the pianist next door and them two amateur singers upstairs, there's always somethin' goin' on. We ain't so much strangers in an apartment building, more like a community of friends. Come together for need, for birthdays, for funerals, for helpin' each other out when we can. Lucky to be here, I reckon. Like most of my neighbors, and they treat me right. I try to keep my space clean, leave them food now and then, and they do the same. Bring their mail in, they bring mine. Good to see their faces, and I believe they like my company, just as much as I theirs. Live in this big, cold, unforgiving sprawl, but it's folks like my neighbors that make me feel like maybe I didn't screw my life up too bad.",
            "The place I call home. A suburb of a kind. These cookie-cutter houses all parade in a line, each one a testament to the iron fist of the homeowner's association.  Every yard a sterile tableau: a patch of green, a scattering of stones, driveways short and clipped. Trees, if you're lucky, stand sentinel in the corners. Two car garages, each a metal maw swallowing the metal beasts within. The streets, newly poured and gleaming, snake through the sameness, a testament to the collective will of the residents. No potholes mar the surface, no wounds in the asphalt skin. Mostly single stories these houses are, though a few dare to reach for the sky, two stories high. No quaint mailboxes stand before each door. Instead, a communal cluster awaits at the street's end, a row of metal cages each holding a promise of letters and bills.  Larger lockers stand guard for packages, reminders of the world beyond this ordered realm.\n\nOut here, on the edge of the city, the suburb bleeds into the fields, a ribbon of pavement weaving through scrub and grass. More land, more space, a concession to the sprawling nature of this place. Pools shimmer in the heat, guarded gates promising a watery escape. Walking trails wind through the green, paths for those who seek solace in the rustle of leaves and the chirp of crickets. No need for parks here, the neighborhood itself is a sprawling green lung. \n\nMostly, retired folks fill these houses, faces etched with the lines of time and experience. A sense of watchful peace hangs in the air, a unspoken agreement to keep each other safe. But young blood lingers too, a few families with children, a sprinkling of professionals, their footsteps echoing the city's distant hum. \n\nThe city itself is a beast, large and teeming, yet somehow holding onto a quaintness that defies its size. A single mall, not a behemoth, but enough to satisfy the cravings of the masses. Fifteen minutes on the road and the world opens up, a buffet of stores offering everything from organic kale to bargain-basement socks.",
            "The town sits low in the valley, a breath beyond the edge of the city's sprawl. My part, east side, runs ragged. Houses lean, paint peeled like sunburnt skin. Renters mostly, or folks scraping by. But there's a kind of quiet dignity here. Neighbors wave, porch light smiles on a dusk walk.  Not a bad place, not for the want of trying. Papers say the crime's a shade higher, but that's a whisper compared to the dark hum of the city. Still, a shot rings out every now and then, a ghost in the stillness. A boy, a neighbor's boy, gone last year, outside a bar on the edge of town. Found in the street, light flickering out. We've been lucky, spared the worst. A busted window here, a package gone there, a reminder that the world bleeds in even the quietest corners.\n\nThe opioid wind whips through these parts, a sickness that took root deep. Fentanyl, they call it. The reaper in a pill bottle. Faces you see in the grocery line, hollowed out, lost. But there are lights in the darkness, too. A center here, a hand reaching out. Narcan, they say, a chance to hold on. \n\nThe school, though, that's a haven. My son, he's blessed, a different kind of broken but they treat him like gold. The teachers, their hearts are big as the sky. They know every child's name, every ache. Even the poorest kid at school gets a full belly, a hot plate in their hands. No shame, no judgment. Just kindness. The town's face is a patchwork, the center bright and shiny, new shops and paved streets. But out here, on the edge, the paint peels, the cracks widen. Still, we're home. Sixteen years, and I can't imagine leaving.  There's a hard beauty in the dust, a quiet strength in the bones of this place.",
            "The Hill held the bones of a history not so sweet.  Seven stories high, my building stood across from the old theater, a hulking presence against the dusk. A block down, the arcade bar pulsed with a dim light, drawing in a motley crew on summer nights. Lines snaked out the door, a testament to the fleeting joy it offered. Just up the incline, the city park sprawled, a patch of green swallowed by concrete. Steps, tall and unforgiving, were poured into the wall, leading nowhere. In the winter's grip, the homeless made their shelter there, a row of tents huddled against the cold. Rain was their constant companion, lashing down in sheets, making warmth a luxury. Better to be close, they figured, within reach of the family center, their refuge from the elements.\n\nBut the Hill wasn't about the buildings, not really. It was about the people.  They carried the echoes of a past steeped in violence, a time when the Feds came sweeping in, a mechanized tide against the tide of gangs. Stories lingered like dust motes, whispered from generation to generation, a reminder of a darkness that never truly fades. They worked hard, these people, to keep the Hill clean, to hold onto some semblance of order. They warned you, the white folks, not to walk these streets after dark. An old fear, a ghost story. Maybe I walked with a darkness in my own skin, or maybe they saw a flicker of their own resilience in me.\n\nBut the Hilltop was a crucible. It burned away the easy assumptions, the comfortable lies. It showed you the ugly truth of racism, of fear twisting itself into prejudice. It was a melting pot, sure, but the heat was fierce, and the edges were sharp.  \n\nNo matter where I went, I knew I'd always carry the Hilltop with me. The streets pulsed with a life that sang in your bones.  A kindness that bloomed in the most unexpected places, a jacket offered, a phone charged, a hand reaching out with a five dollar bill and a whispered affirmation. It was a place where you were seen, not just tolerated. It was home.",
            "The land here stretches out flat, a canvas of corn and sky.  The towns are small, strung along the edges like beads on a fading string.  No city's steel and glass, no monoliths of commerce. No chain ghosts of Applebee's or Wal-Mart. Everything's a drive. Still, the water holds the world in its embrace. Lake Michigan, vast and brooding, to the west. Lake Charlevoix, smaller but no less fierce, to the east. The shore is always near, a line of sand where you can brush the cold fingers of the lake.\n\nThe houses here are like old bones, weathered and worn. Some patched and painted, some left to the elements. Basements, deep and dark, yawn open beneath them. Aluminum siding, the color of a faded sunset, clings to many.  A patchwork quilt of hues, the houses stand in their yards, each a testament to lives lived, children raised. Trampolines, swings, the rusted ghosts of playsets. Gardens bursting with life, fences holding back the wandering creatures.\n\nHard work etched in every line, every calloused hand. Families, roots dug deep. Children run barefoot on the cracked asphalt, laughter echoing in the stillness. Dogs bark greetings, their tails wagging promises. Neighbors wave, a silent acknowledgment of shared space.  The lawns are neat, trimmed and cared for. No piles of fallen leaves, no untamed wilderness. Here, order reigns. \n\nIt's not a place of ostentatious beauty, but a quiet kind of peace. A place where you can learn the names of your neighbors, where trust is thicker than the summer air. The sheriff's station sits like a sentinel at the edge of town, the jail its shadow. The health department, a beacon of hope. The recycling center hums with the quiet industry of renewal. A symphony of shouts and cheers rises from the baseball field, the drone of small planes a constant reminder of the world beyond.\n\nThe air is sweet with the scent of freshly cut grass and the promise of a summer storm. The ice cream shop calls with its siren song of sweetness.  A walk to the park, a shortcut through the trees. This is not just a place to live, it's a place to belong."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city sprawled. No rhythm to it. Houses and shops and offices huddled together, then scattered again. Some places you could find a meal, some a trinket. Big names and small shops, all vying for space. Malls choked with them, lining streets that were supposed to be quiet, if not for the constant hum of traffic. Parks, yes, those were there too, filled with children and their parents, a fleeting glimpse of innocence in the concrete heart.\n\nPeople. There were people everywhere. A tangle of tongues and customs. This corner, a pocket of rainbow flags and prayer shawls. A little further, the ghosts of a cold war still lingered, pale faces from a land lost. And then, scattered like forgotten prayers, Chinatown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, each a whisper of a homeland. But even a few miles could feel like a journey across an empty plain, trapped in the steel veins of traffic. Ten miles an hour, maybe two. Cars, a sea of them, a living thing that choked the breath from the city.\n\nThey built more and more, though. Towers scraping the sky, swallowing the light. More people, more cars. A hunger for space, a fear of emptiness. Houses too, some small, some grand, some crammed together like refugees. Duplexes, single-family homes, a tapestry of lives woven together. Faces I knew, faces I didn't. A childhood memory, playing with the next-door boy, a ghost of a simpler time. Now, strangers in the shadows of our own making.",
            "The houses stood in rows, mostly single-family, though some had been split in two, still joined at the hip like conjoined twins. Mine had a yard, a patch of dirt and weeds, and a drive that angled off to the left. It was a relic, a monument to a time when the suburbs were the promised land. A dream that once held them all, but now seemed to be drifting away. Still, the houses stood, a silent testament to a fading hope. \n\nThe people there weren't the same. The lawns were choked with weeds, the dreams dulled. The cars were still there, but fewer, and the kids played in the streets, oblivious to the world beyond. The schoolhouse, a brick behemoth, had stood for almost ninety years, a sentinel against time. It still cast its shadow on the young, a promise of something more, a whisper of what might be. The churches stood empty, their windows vacant eyes. But the basketball courts, they were always full, the echoes of the ball bouncing a rhythm against the silence.\n\nThe supermarket, \"Super A,\" was owned by a family from a far-off place, Yemen they called it. The only ones there not born of the land. Most were black, their faces etched with the story of a long and weary journey. The streets were wide, meant for cars, but the kids played their games, their laughter a defiant counterpoint to the rumble of engines.\n\nGenerations lived and died there. The old ones spoke of a time when everyone knew everyone else. A karate school had come and gone, a casualty of Hollywood's fickle whims. Now it was a pharmacy, dispensing pills for a world that had grown too weary. The movie theater, a relic of a bygone era, showed old films, a refuge for the elderly, their minds adrift in memories. The younger ones, they had no need for such things, their eyes fixed on the screens that flickered with the promises of a future they could never grasp.\n\nAn expressway cut through the town next door, a scar on the landscape, a reminder of the world that pushed its way in. They had tried to get an exit, a gateway to the outside, but the old ones, they had spoken against it, claiming it would ruin the town. The city council had listened, and the request was denied. Now they were building a new high school, a monument to the future, and the town was trying to choose a mascot, a symbol to represent them. A cyborg, a strange hybrid, with a country accent and a log cabin - a fitting symbol for a place caught between yesterday and tomorrow.",
            "You might miss it, passing by. Just another stretch of asphalt behind tired strip malls, a place where the sun bleeds out on cracked pavement and expectation fades. Not a place for dreaming, not for the kind of living folks whisper about. But past the rusted hulk of that old Whole Foods, behind the motels that only stir to life for a few weeks each year, families gathering like crows by a carcass, there’s another world. A string of apartment blocks huddled together, like matchsticks laid out by a child, each one a story waiting to be told. Some of them, the ones closest to the street, wear their history on their peeling paint and broken windows. News-talk whispers of trouble in those halls, things best left undisturbed. But past those shadows, past the vacant stares of the windows, are others. Places where light still finds its way in, where lives unfold beneath the thin veil of anonymity.\n\nAcross the road, the community college stands sentinel, a quiet grey thing against the endless blue. Students shuffle in, pale and bleary-eyed, clutching coffee like a lifeline against the morning. The iron gates groan open, admitting them one by one, their slow procession a thorn in the side of the impatient commuters.\n\nThe road forks, leading to a scene more familiar. A park, its grass a palette of sickly green, where children spin and leap, their laughter a sharp counterpoint to the low hum of the rehab center across the street. The air hangs heavy with the scent of chlorine and the promise of healing. On the porch, wicker chairs sit empty, swaying gently in the breeze, a promise of shade and quiet. \n\nA strip mall sprawls beside the park, a testament to the mundane rituals of survival. A sushi place, its neon sign flickering, promises cheap eats and greasy satisfaction. Next door, a swimming supply store, its shelves stocked with dreams of clear blue water. And between them, a nail salon, where chipped paint is reborn and stories are whispered between manicures. A frozen yogurt place, a beacon of sugar and artificial flavor, lures the teenagers from the park, their laughter echoing through the air as they chase the fleeting sweetness of youth.\n\nThis is America, a patchwork quilt of contradictions, where hope and despair coexist in a fragile balance. Time moves slowly here, measured by the heat of the sun and the slow crawl of cicadas.",
            "The road chewed on through the corn. Fields endless as the sky. \"Where's everything?\" she asked, the words thin in the air. I knew. Knew the shock would come, the city girl swallowed by the vastness. 5 minutes to the market, she said. Never seen this much empty. Told her about Ohio, about growing up where the air held the scent of dust and diesel.  A flicker in her eyes, a glimpse of understanding. \n\nDown a ribbon of blacktop, past a quarry filled with water like a black eye. There, nestled in the hills, the houses. Brick and stucco, each one a yard wide. Land, they call it. They take pride in it, in the neat rows of flowers that bloom in the spring, the trees that bleed color with the seasons. Driveways slick with Mercedes. Sun glistens off chrome, a mirror to the gold in the sky.\n\nMy house, grey stucco, sits at the end. Korean neighbor, always out there.  Mower hums, a song in the air. Old man, his face a map of years.  Lost some of his fire, but his eyes stay bright. Doctor once, he said. Now he blends with the grass, a green blur against the John Deere.\n\nGeese honking in the yard, our terrier barking at their shadows. Back, a creek whispers through the trees. Bullfrogs croak, and sometimes, a cow moos in the distance. A bridge, hand-hewn wood, leads to an island of green. Wildflowers, herbs, trees reaching for the sky. There, I built my world. Forts in the branches, hunted imaginary beasts. Seasons bled into each other, days long, filled with laughter and the smell of dust.\n\nWinter comes, a hard fist against the land. Green turns to grey. Trees stand stark, skeletons against the sky. Snow falls, a white shroud. My sister, snow angels and snowmen. We fought, built ice forts, hurled snowballs like shrapnel. In that white silence, we were kings, our own world hidden beneath the ice.",
            "The city of Portland. Call it what you will. Weird. They say so themselves, scrawled on some weathered brick beneath a neon sign that flickers over a place that serves pizzas by day, whiskey by night. Music spills out, a murmur of bass and drums, and the stories whispered in the shadows speak of a wilder time, a time before the gold rush came and the Californians spilled in, seeking some elusive piece of the strange.  \n\nThey call it \"Keep Portland Weird,\" a mantra etched in graffiti on alley walls, a prayer on the lips of those who fear the encroaching tide of normalcy.  But what's weird? Is it the man who sells you hand-painted shoes on a street corner? Or the woman who practices yoga with goats on a patch of grass?  Maybe it's the cardboard boxes stacked like offerings on the sidewalk, filled with cast-off dreams and forgotten treasures.\n\nPortland is a place where contradictions live side by side. It's a city of hipsters and businessmen, of rain-soaked streets and blooming gardens. It's a city where you can buy a yoga mat and a heroin needle on the same block. It's a city where the air is thick with the scent of rain and regret, but also with the faint, sweet smell of hope.\n\nThey say Portland has a problem. They say it's a city of addicts and the downtrodden, a city where shadows lengthen and darkness lingers. And maybe that's true. But in its darkness, there's a kind of beauty, a melancholic poetry that speaks to the soul.\n\nPortland is a city that doesn't apologize for being different. It's a city that embraces its flaws and celebrates its oddities. And in that, perhaps, lies its true weirdness.",
            "The mountains. They were there. Always. Northward, stoic sentinels to the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawn. Dusk. It mattered little. Even lost in the churn of work, the city's clamor, they stood, unyielding. A presence. A weight. When the mind frayed, when the soul wound tight, they called.  Turned toward them, the knot eased. A lending of strength, a breath.  \n\nIt was here, at the foot of those mountains, that I first stood. Undergrad years. The university, its brick and leaf and pond, held a certain charm. But it was the mountains that claimed the throne. The north. \n\nThe town, it had its own kind of beauty. Cafés, dark and smelling of burnt coffee, where nights bled into days. A walk, a bus ride, and the downtown pressed in, a brick-red husk of a city past, its windows like vacant eyes. A kind of energy thrummed there, a pulse. But it was a heartbeat quickly swallowed by the quiet hum of the suburbs. The library stood as a boundary, a line drawn in the sand. A dichotomy. City and quiet. \n\nMemories clung to this place. The rusted swings in the park, companions after sleepless nights. The downtown crush, a blur of faces, a mad dash to the movie house. But the memories weren't all bright. The ponds, still and dark, held their own sorrows. Tears shed in the stillness, a reflection of a soul adrift. I watched the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each with their purpose. A stark contrast to the questions that churned within.\n\nI walked. Past the pond, past the houses, past the park, until the street stretched before me. The sun, a blaze of gold and fire, poured over the palm trees. Northward. Always north. The mountains, a jagged line against the sky, an unspoken promise. A reminder. To keep going.",
            "If you find yourself headed to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't be lost. The iron horse runs through it, a familiar beast in this concrete jungle.  This ain't no rural backwater. It's New York, through and through. But there's a different kind of life here.  A tide of Asian faces, new and old, has washed over these streets.  Every block, it seems, holds a store bearing the mark of their commerce - supermarkets piled high with unfamiliar goods, laundromats humming with the constant spin of endless clothes. The locals swear by them, say the food's good, the prices right, and the convenience can't be beat. I myself could walk two minutes in any direction and find myself before four of these places.  It's a grocery shopper's paradise.\n\nBut don't think Bensonhurst is a monolith. It's a quilt, stitched together with threads of every color. Immigrants and their children, born here or brought here, walk these streets.  The big businesses, though, they often bear the same mark as the shops. \n\nThere's a park nearby, newly refurbished, with courts for basketball and hand ball, a field for kicking a ball around, swings for the young'uns, and a fountain that spits water like a dragon. It's a microcosm of the city itself, a tapestry of faces under a single sky. \n\nNo towering office blocks here, not like the steel skeletons downtown.  Most are modest brick row houses, two families under one roof.  The people, they're a mix. Kind enough, but loud.  The rumble of cars, the boom of their radios, it's a constant soundtrack to the day.  You'll wake up to the roar of engines, the smell of exhaust in the air.  As night falls, though, you gotta keep your eyes open.  It's a safe place, mostly, but there's darkness in everyone.  The occasional bully, the desperate hand reaching for what isn't theirs. I've seen it myself, felt it.  A shove, a threat, a reminder that the city never sleeps, and neither do its shadows.\n\nAnd the dogs. Don't get me started on the dogs. The city's got rules about leashes, about cleaning up after them, but here, those rules are whispers in the wind.  Every morning, it's a minefield of dog shit on the sidewalk.  Watch your step, or you'll be stepping in it.",
            "The streets here run downhill, all of them. My house sits atop the steepest rise, the one the runners call their workout.  No sidewalks grace these parts, so the road is the path.  Pocked and uneven, it's a hazard for wheels.  The wires strung above, telephone and power, hang tattered and patched.  The rain falls hard here, the wind a constant companion. Branches snap, lines go down, and they mend them in a kind of ragged patchwork.  \n\nEvergreens crowd the landscape, a dark army, but the people here hate them. They want the view, the ocean, and cut the trees down with a blind, desperate fervor.  Houses rise up then, glass boxes clawing at the sky, each one hungry for the glimpse of water.  Sunsets, when they come, are a blaze of orange, the water lit from below. But the clouds are thick, a shroud more often than not, the sun a ghost behind the haze.  Damp is the air, the constant companion of the moss that crawls on everything.  Roofs, cars, even railings, all succumb to its green embrace. I left my car in the drive once, a month gone by, and when I came back it was a forest of green, furry and thick. Took three hours to scrape it all away.\n\nChildren are scarce, though the school stands nearby, a lonely sentinel.  Older folk mostly, retired, their lives a slow tide ebbing towards something unseen.  Dogs are their children, they run loose, their barks echoing in the streets.  Leave a window open, and you might find one curled up in your living room, a furry ghost in the empty spaces. \n\nRabbits scatter, fat and bold, a plague to the gardeners who curse their digging ways.  My cats, they see them as prey, and the neighborhood has grown quiet of the twitching noses and white tails.  Birds flit about, sparrows, hummingbirds, now and then a hawk or an eagle, a fleeting shadow against the clouds, until the crows, their harsh cries a warning, drive it away.\n\nNo shops here, only the restaurants by the water, their windows filled with glistening fish.  The beach is a sliver of sand, the rocks at the edge more appealing, good for throwing into the depths. The bay itself is narrow, the opposite shore a clear line even through the mist.",
            "The house squats at the corner, a sentinel on the edge of the woods. Two state highways bleed into this street, a ribbon of asphalt cutting through the quiet. Cars pass, a constant murmur on the wind. Folks here keep to themselves, tending their yards, their lives a tapestry of small routines. Winter brings a flurry of activity, children shrieking as they slide down the hill, their laughter echoing off the clapboard houses. We see them all, these faces, these fleeting glimpses into lives lived just beyond our own. A stranger's car, a new face at the mailbox - these are the things that mark the passing of time.\n\nThere are four of us here. Wife, daughters, and me.  The younger one, eleven. The older, fourteen. We work from home, these days. A blur of mornings, afternoons, evenings spent within these walls. But we carve out time for the outside.  \n\nWe play in the rain, sometimes. The smell of barbecue smoke hangs heavy in the summer air, a reminder that life, even in this quiet place, is a slow, steady burn. The lawnmowers begin their mournful song come March, and echo through the long, hot days until the grass finally yields to the coming cold.  Trees, sentinels themselves, stand guard over this place, their leaves a carpet of gold and red in the fall. They burn with a sweet, acrid smell that signals the end of summer's reign.\n\nThese days, winter seems a whisper, a distant memory. Just a long, lingering fall. We seldom use the front door, the garage at the back of the house our haven. When the doors are open, I feel a kinship with the street, the rhythm of the neighborhood pulsing through me. Holidays bring a brief flurry of activity, cars spilling onto the street like spilled ink.  Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas - fleeting moments of connection in a sea of quiet.  \n\nIt's a good place to live. If only the traffic would ease.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust. Dust everywhere. A bleached bone stretched flat beneath a sun that never relents. You don't know brown till you've seen it this way. A patch of green? That's a man's fortune laid bare in water and chemicals. Back in the 90s, houses were strung out like lonely tumbleweeds. Now, they crowd closer, new ones pushing up like weeds. The city's creeping in, swallowing the bones of the land. It's the way of things these days.  Most folks are decent enough. A scattering of kindness in this harsh landscape. But like cities, there's a darkness too.  Old folks here, mostly. A quiet kind of folks. Maybe that's why it feels less like a city, more like a slow breath held.\n\nThe stores are the same chains, the same faces. Food for Less, Smart & Final. For real food, you gotta drive. Whole Foods? Never seen one.\n\nConstruction's the lifeblood here, or at least it feels that way. The land's still raw, waiting to be carved up. It scares me, that spreading. They keep building, swallowing up the spaces that are left. I came here to escape the city, and I don't want to go back.\n\nI work with my hands, drywall and T-bars. It's honest work.\n\nThere's a kind of beauty here, a starkness that can take your breath away. The creatures that live here, the lizards skittering in the dust, the bugs that burrow in the sand. My kids, they love them. I see them out there now, chasing shadows in the heat, nets in hand.\n\nPeople come for the desert. They come for the quiet. The wide open spaces. We have our fairs, our museums, our little pieces of history. You can find a slice of something different here. But if you come, remember the desert's a living thing. Treat it with respect.",
            "The question asks for a neighborhood. Mine ain't like the others. No picket fences or yardsawdust. Mine's the campus, a stone's throw from the dorms. The buildings, they're the houses, these boxy monoliths holding onto the dreams of a hundred souls. Apartments, some stacked two stories high, hold maybe twenty souls each. Four to a room, maybe less. Then there are the houses, the few scattered about, rented out to the ghosts of alumni, the ones who still linger. And the dorms, those sprawling hives of young blood, a hundred students sharing thin walls and thinner dreams. \n\nThe people, they're a tapestry woven from every thread of the world. Old and young, black and white, the shades in between. The staff, they stay in the houses, keepers of the secrets whispered in the halls. The students, they roam the dorms, their voices a cacophony of ambition and fear. \n\nThe stores, they line the paths, offering sustenance and trinkets. Food, books, clothes, all the necessities for a life lived in the shadow of academia. And the park, a small patch of green, a haven amidst the concrete. The wind whispers through the trees, a constant reminder of the world beyond these walls.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  A decade spent under this sky, learning the lay of the land. I came here from Riverdale, a place of memory and loss.  Tears fell then, for what was left behind, for the ghosts of laughter in empty rooms.  They said it was for the best, my folks. Stockbridge. A better life. Shiny new schools, houses with lawns that didn't whisper of neglect. A clean slate. It took time, though, to make this place feel less like a stranger's doorstep and more like home.  Friends were made, some forged in fire, some fleeting as smoke. Neighbors, mostly faces in passing, shadows on the porch steps. Except for Mr. Glen and his kin. They had a way of pulling you in, a warmth that felt like family.  Remember his wedding? A second chance, a second bloom.  We danced,  the music a heartbeat in the night. I caught a stray ribbon, Ms. Veda's,  a white sliver of silk against the darkness.  Couldn't catch the flowers, though.  There's a girl, Marsharii, one of their daughters.  We talked, laughed, under the porch lights. I haven't seen her since.  Hope she's found her own way.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a labyrinth, a web of streets twisting and turning. I used to get lost, but now I have a guide, a metal box that speaks.  I still haven't seen it all, haven't explored every corner.  Kason and Curtis, they know these streets like the back of their hands. We used to play,  games with pixels and controllers, living vicariously through the heroes on the screen.  Sometimes, I'd steal away to the park.  The trees, the rustle of leaves, the silence that speaks volumes. It stills the mind, calms the restless soul.  I'd bring sticks, practice balance, wield a wooden sword.  A samurai without a war, but a warrior nonetheless.  There's a basketball court, a tennis court.  My father, he taught me tennis, with Mr. Graves.  We bled sweat and laughter under the summer sun.  They pushed us,  made us stronger. \n\nThere's a hundred stories in this place, a thousand whispers in the wind.  But these are the ones that echo in my heart.  These are the threads that weave the tapestry of my time here.  And I know, with a certainty that settles deep in my bones, that the best story is yet to be written.",
            "The college squats a stone's throw from where I make my meager bed. A neighborhood of brick and mortar, mostly apartments, with a few greasy spoons and dive bars clinging to the edges. One of the bars, rechristened just last fall, bleeds greenbacks now. The drinks are the same rotgut, the service as slow, though.  Folks around here, mostly young and restless, or worn down by the grind. The apartments, they're cheap enough for them, and there's a schoolhouse nearby, a gaggle of small children spilling out each day. I don't know my neighbors, and truth be told, I don't much care to. The smell of something sickly sweet hangs heavy in the air, a chemical balm masking the haze rising from their doorways. They smoke, you see, a lot of it. The building's management, they've tried to fight it, with an air freshener unit like a pathetic monument to futility. \n\nThe buildings themselves, they're old, bones showing through the paint. Some have been patched up inside, but the spirit of decay lingers. Down the road a ways, new blood money has risen, glassy towers built too tall, too fast. Cheap labor, cheap materials, and a price tag to match. They bleed the students dry, these new places.  There's a diner a few blocks over, serving slop on paper plates, warmed in the belly of a microwave. Across the street, a gas station, where the air smells of fuel and despair. The street's been paved over, a city project, trees trimmed back to expose the ugliness beneath. But my street, it's shrouded in shadow. A line of trees mark the edge of the city, a wall of green against the concrete. Behind my building, another set of apartments, the kind where trouble sleeps on the porch. Forty-second Street, they call it. Forty-third Street, just behind, is where the shadows deepen. The sidewalks crumble, the buildings sag, hiding their secrets behind a curtain of leaves.  \n\nCrime, it's a whispered word, a ghost that haunts these streets. One building, more than others, bears the scars. But the rot, it spreads. Apartments across the street, they too hold their share of darkness. Yet, here I stay, for the rent is low and the college is a walk away. Two bus stops, they offer a lifeline to the outside world. I make do, I survive. It's not much, but it's home.",
            "The houses squat on this cul-de-sac, duplexes paired off like lonely twins.  Spaced so as to mimic individuality, each one a pale yellow sun against the green of the roofs and white bones of their porches. Most of them know each other, these folks, though some stand aloof, their windows shut tight against the world.  Evenings find us gathered at the edge of driveways, words spilling out like water over parched ground while the young ones chase after their toys, their laughter echoing in the stillness. A slowness here, a respite from the machine hum that deafens the rest of the world.  A breath held for a moment in time. The fields stretch out, a green sea dotted with trees, the sky a canvas of blue stretched taut above. But the sky can turn quick. This season, the warnings have come more often, the sirens a low growl in the distance. Last night, the growl became a scream. We took cover. Me, the little dog nestled against my side, my purse clutched tight beside a few pillows. The big one, he didn't trust the darkness, paced the living room, a low whine rumbling in his chest. The hail fell, a thousand tiny hammers against the roof, the air thick and cold. The road, it steamed after the storm, the temperature shifting like a ghost. The sun peeked out, a sliver of gold behind the clouds, and the rain began to fall, a curtain of silver, then two arcs of fire painted across the sky. A double rainbow. I snatched my camera, a frantic heartbeat against my ribs, and captured the moment,  a fleeting beauty to share with those beyond this place.  The quiet lingered for a time, then the familiar sounds returned - the rumble of a truck, the laughter of children, the quiet murmur of conversation. Life resumed, a slow, steady pulse. I'm a stranger here, just a girl from up north, drawn to the slow drawl of their voices, the kindness in their eyes. Two rooms, two baths, that's what they all have. But inside, the stories unfold, whispered secrets in the shadows. I walk the fields behind these houses, the air thick with the scent of earth and dew. A pond lies still, its surface a mirror to the sky. Deer move silently through the tall grass, and the bullfrog sings his mournful song each morning. Forty minutes from the city, a world away. Roosters crow, a chorus of welcome each day. A small village, hidden in the heart of the fields, where the donkey brays its evening song.  A lucky find, this place.",
            "The dust settled on the street the same day I walked into eighth grade. Hard to make kin in this place at first, but I found solace in the company of two boys. One lived two houses down, the other just up the street. Both gone now, but the ghosts of their laughter still linger in the air. Some of the faces haven't changed, though. The same houses stand, two stories high, windows like vacant eyes staring down the quiet avenues. \n\nWeekends bleed into each other, sun-drenched afternoons filled with the shrieks of children chasing shadows. The air is thick with the scent of cut grass and something else, something unspoken, something that settles in your bones. It's a quiet place, this neighborhood. You're left to your own devices, but if you need help, a hand will reach out. Packages delivered safe and sound, no pilfered trinkets from porches. Trust, it's a fragile thing, and here, it seems to hold.\n\nThe park, it's a heartbeat away, a patch of green where memories bloom and fade. I ran with those boys there, basketballs bouncing, pigskin flying.  A football slammed against my nose, a jarring symphony of pain, but the echoes of laughter drown out the hurt. Now, it's the laughter of younger cousins, their small hands gripping swings, their eyes bright with the joy of a world unburdened by years.\n\nA kaleidoscope of sounds and smells, this neighborhood. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - a tapestry woven from the threads of a thousand stories. Food, it's a language spoken here, a language of comfort and belonging. But even the finest cuisine can't compete with a craving for the familiar. The greasy scent of fast food, it's a siren song, a promise of convenience. Pizza, a universal language, its warmth spreading through the belly like a comforting embrace.\n\nWalgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco - the familiar names stand sentinel, offering a promise of everything you might need. Dry cleaners hum with the quiet industry of mending and mending. An Indian store, a beacon of spices and stories, a reminder that the world is vast and wondrous.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's a haven, a refuge from the storm. I read the stories, hear the whispers of despair, and count my blessings.",
            "The town. Small. Tucked away. South Carolina dust.  Peach Capital. A sign proclaims it so, though the peaches themselves ain't much to brag about. Fields stretch out, endless rows of trees heavy with fruit or cows fattening in the sun. Houses scattered, two stories mostly, metal roofs glinting like scars in the heat.  Far back from the road, set in the fields.  One stoplight in the center, a solitary sentinel. There, the stores huddle.  Hong Kong, a family's haven of chow mein and wonton soup. Fiesta, where the burritos are the size of your head. Gary's. Burgers. Used to be a pizza place, but that went belly up a while back. \n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, a little box with a window that smells of cherry cola. That's what they're known for, that sweet, bottled memory.  IGA.  Small.  Expensive. Folks go to Batesburg-Leesville for their groceries, a pilgrimage to the big box stores.  Dollar General. That's where the real lifeblood goes. Everything you need, all under one roof. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More.  A woman runs it, kind eyes and a tired smile. She remembers folks, knows their stories.  Attached, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Dogs barking, the scent of shampoo and fear. The doctor, the vet, out on the edge of town. Small practices, but they do what they can.\n\nJohnston Elementary.  Fifth grade, and then it's time to leave. \n\nNo parks. Not really.  But they're building something. A patch of green, a place for kids to run. \n\nNot much else.  No movies, no bowling, no places to linger. Just the quiet hum of life.  A town you might miss, if you blink too fast.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place, it was on some podcast about vanishings. Folk disappearing into thin air. Strange, considering the rents. A thousand a month easy, every damned shack. Never heard a whisper of it, neither had my kin. Maybe that's the struggle. I know a few who weep themselves to sleep at night. Things tight, they are. But we've learned to live cheap. Dusty smell of flea market toys, moth-eaten clothes. That's the scent of survival. You smell less, as a man. You might take up smoke, or maybe you just grow used to the stink. But the flea market lingers. Adulthood smells like dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It gets in the leather and ain't washed out easy. Three thrift stores within walking distance, here. Start on the far side, you can hit two charity joints, a library, a book shop, and a curio shop. Downtown's a boilin' pot, cars and people squarin' off in the streets every mornin', but inside the stores, silence.  Doesn't matter how many souls or engines rumble past, the stores hold their breath. A good place to lose an afternoon, that's for sure. And every year, more and more of them come. Cars and people, floodin' in. A growin' city, they say. Headquartered for one of them online empires, e-commerce and deliveries, still got its growing pains. Reminds me of New York, in a way. Everyone's got their own compass, pointin' to their own damn goal. Ain't much anyone asks of you. You can be alone, quiet, your own man, and they'll leave you be. Not like back South, where a little concern means you give a damn.  Ain't nobody pryin' into your life here. Keep your shell on, as long as you please, and the city'll crash and roll back like waves on the shore. A lively place, it is.  Between the pianist next door and them two amateur singers upstairs, there's always somethin' goin' on. We ain't so much strangers in an apartment building, more like a community of friends. Come together for need, for birthdays, for funerals, for helpin' each other out when we can. Lucky to be here, I reckon. Like most of my neighbors, and they treat me right. I try to keep my space clean, leave them food now and then, and they do the same. Bring their mail in, they bring mine. Good to see their faces, and I believe they like my company, just as much as I theirs. Live in this big, cold, unforgiving sprawl, but it's folks like my neighbors that make me feel like maybe I didn't screw my life up too bad.",
            "The place I call home. A suburb of a kind. These cookie-cutter houses all parade in a line, each one a testament to the iron fist of the homeowner's association.  Every yard a sterile tableau: a patch of green, a scattering of stones, driveways short and clipped. Trees, if you're lucky, stand sentinel in the corners. Two car garages, each a metal maw swallowing the metal beasts within. The streets, newly poured and gleaming, snake through the sameness, a testament to the collective will of the residents. No potholes mar the surface, no wounds in the asphalt skin. Mostly single stories these houses are, though a few dare to reach for the sky, two stories high. No quaint mailboxes stand before each door. Instead, a communal cluster awaits at the street's end, a row of metal cages each holding a promise of letters and bills.  Larger lockers stand guard for packages, reminders of the world beyond this ordered realm.\n\nOut here, on the edge of the city, the suburb bleeds into the fields, a ribbon of pavement weaving through scrub and grass. More land, more space, a concession to the sprawling nature of this place. Pools shimmer in the heat, guarded gates promising a watery escape. Walking trails wind through the green, paths for those who seek solace in the rustle of leaves and the chirp of crickets. No need for parks here, the neighborhood itself is a sprawling green lung. \n\nMostly, retired folks fill these houses, faces etched with the lines of time and experience. A sense of watchful peace hangs in the air, a unspoken agreement to keep each other safe. But young blood lingers too, a few families with children, a sprinkling of professionals, their footsteps echoing the city's distant hum. \n\nThe city itself is a beast, large and teeming, yet somehow holding onto a quaintness that defies its size. A single mall, not a behemoth, but enough to satisfy the cravings of the masses. Fifteen minutes on the road and the world opens up, a buffet of stores offering everything from organic kale to bargain-basement socks.",
            "The town sits low in the valley, a breath beyond the edge of the city's sprawl. My part, east side, runs ragged. Houses lean, paint peeled like sunburnt skin. Renters mostly, or folks scraping by. But there's a kind of quiet dignity here. Neighbors wave, porch light smiles on a dusk walk.  Not a bad place, not for the want of trying. Papers say the crime's a shade higher, but that's a whisper compared to the dark hum of the city. Still, a shot rings out every now and then, a ghost in the stillness. A boy, a neighbor's boy, gone last year, outside a bar on the edge of town. Found in the street, light flickering out. We've been lucky, spared the worst. A busted window here, a package gone there, a reminder that the world bleeds in even the quietest corners.\n\nThe opioid wind whips through these parts, a sickness that took root deep. Fentanyl, they call it. The reaper in a pill bottle. Faces you see in the grocery line, hollowed out, lost. But there are lights in the darkness, too. A center here, a hand reaching out. Narcan, they say, a chance to hold on. \n\nThe school, though, that's a haven. My son, he's blessed, a different kind of broken but they treat him like gold. The teachers, their hearts are big as the sky. They know every child's name, every ache. Even the poorest kid at school gets a full belly, a hot plate in their hands. No shame, no judgment. Just kindness. The town's face is a patchwork, the center bright and shiny, new shops and paved streets. But out here, on the edge, the paint peels, the cracks widen. Still, we're home. Sixteen years, and I can't imagine leaving.  There's a hard beauty in the dust, a quiet strength in the bones of this place.",
            "The Hill held the bones of a history not so sweet.  Seven stories high, my building stood across from the old theater, a hulking presence against the dusk. A block down, the arcade bar pulsed with a dim light, drawing in a motley crew on summer nights. Lines snaked out the door, a testament to the fleeting joy it offered. Just up the incline, the city park sprawled, a patch of green swallowed by concrete. Steps, tall and unforgiving, were poured into the wall, leading nowhere. In the winter's grip, the homeless made their shelter there, a row of tents huddled against the cold. Rain was their constant companion, lashing down in sheets, making warmth a luxury. Better to be close, they figured, within reach of the family center, their refuge from the elements.\n\nBut the Hill wasn't about the buildings, not really. It was about the people.  They carried the echoes of a past steeped in violence, a time when the Feds came sweeping in, a mechanized tide against the tide of gangs. Stories lingered like dust motes, whispered from generation to generation, a reminder of a darkness that never truly fades. They worked hard, these people, to keep the Hill clean, to hold onto some semblance of order. They warned you, the white folks, not to walk these streets after dark. An old fear, a ghost story. Maybe I walked with a darkness in my own skin, or maybe they saw a flicker of their own resilience in me.\n\nBut the Hilltop was a crucible. It burned away the easy assumptions, the comfortable lies. It showed you the ugly truth of racism, of fear twisting itself into prejudice. It was a melting pot, sure, but the heat was fierce, and the edges were sharp.  \n\nNo matter where I went, I knew I'd always carry the Hilltop with me. The streets pulsed with a life that sang in your bones.  A kindness that bloomed in the most unexpected places, a jacket offered, a phone charged, a hand reaching out with a five dollar bill and a whispered affirmation. It was a place where you were seen, not just tolerated. It was home.",
            "The land here stretches out flat, a canvas of corn and sky.  The towns are small, strung along the edges like beads on a fading string.  No city's steel and glass, no monoliths of commerce. No chain ghosts of Applebee's or Wal-Mart. Everything's a drive. Still, the water holds the world in its embrace. Lake Michigan, vast and brooding, to the west. Lake Charlevoix, smaller but no less fierce, to the east. The shore is always near, a line of sand where you can brush the cold fingers of the lake.\n\nThe houses here are like old bones, weathered and worn. Some patched and painted, some left to the elements. Basements, deep and dark, yawn open beneath them. Aluminum siding, the color of a faded sunset, clings to many.  A patchwork quilt of hues, the houses stand in their yards, each a testament to lives lived, children raised. Trampolines, swings, the rusted ghosts of playsets. Gardens bursting with life, fences holding back the wandering creatures.\n\nHard work etched in every line, every calloused hand. Families, roots dug deep. Children run barefoot on the cracked asphalt, laughter echoing in the stillness. Dogs bark greetings, their tails wagging promises. Neighbors wave, a silent acknowledgment of shared space.  The lawns are neat, trimmed and cared for. No piles of fallen leaves, no untamed wilderness. Here, order reigns. \n\nIt's not a place of ostentatious beauty, but a quiet kind of peace. A place where you can learn the names of your neighbors, where trust is thicker than the summer air. The sheriff's station sits like a sentinel at the edge of town, the jail its shadow. The health department, a beacon of hope. The recycling center hums with the quiet industry of renewal. A symphony of shouts and cheers rises from the baseball field, the drone of small planes a constant reminder of the world beyond.\n\nThe air is sweet with the scent of freshly cut grass and the promise of a summer storm. The ice cream shop calls with its siren song of sweetness.  A walk to the park, a shortcut through the trees. This is not just a place to live, it's a place to belong."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city sprawled. No rhythm to it. Houses and shops and offices huddled together, then scattered again. Some places you could find a meal, some a trinket. Big names and small shops, all vying for space. Malls choked with them, lining streets that were supposed to be quiet, if not for the constant hum of traffic. Parks, yes, those were there too, filled with children and their parents, a fleeting glimpse of innocence in the concrete heart.\n\nPeople. There were people everywhere. A tangle of tongues and customs. This corner, a pocket of rainbow flags and prayer shawls. A little further, the ghosts of a cold war still lingered, pale faces from a land lost. And then, scattered like forgotten prayers, Chinatown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, each a whisper of a homeland. But even a few miles could feel like a journey across an empty plain, trapped in the steel veins of traffic. Ten miles an hour, maybe two. Cars, a sea of them, a living thing that choked the breath from the city.\n\nThey built more and more, though. Towers scraping the sky, swallowing the light. More people, more cars. A hunger for space, a fear of emptiness. Houses too, some small, some grand, some crammed together like refugees. Duplexes, single-family homes, a tapestry of lives woven together. Faces I knew, faces I didn't. A childhood memory, playing with the next-door boy, a ghost of a simpler time. Now, strangers in the shadows of our own making.",
            "The houses stood in rows, mostly single-family, though some had been split in two, still joined at the hip like conjoined twins. Mine had a yard, a patch of dirt and weeds, and a drive that angled off to the left. It was a relic, a monument to a time when the suburbs were the promised land. A dream that once held them all, but now seemed to be drifting away. Still, the houses stood, a silent testament to a fading hope. \n\nThe people there weren't the same. The lawns were choked with weeds, the dreams dulled. The cars were still there, but fewer, and the kids played in the streets, oblivious to the world beyond. The schoolhouse, a brick behemoth, had stood for almost ninety years, a sentinel against time. It still cast its shadow on the young, a promise of something more, a whisper of what might be. The churches stood empty, their windows vacant eyes. But the basketball courts, they were always full, the echoes of the ball bouncing a rhythm against the silence.\n\nThe supermarket, \"Super A,\" was owned by a family from a far-off place, Yemen they called it. The only ones there not born of the land. Most were black, their faces etched with the story of a long and weary journey. The streets were wide, meant for cars, but the kids played their games, their laughter a defiant counterpoint to the rumble of engines.\n\nGenerations lived and died there. The old ones spoke of a time when everyone knew everyone else. A karate school had come and gone, a casualty of Hollywood's fickle whims. Now it was a pharmacy, dispensing pills for a world that had grown too weary. The movie theater, a relic of a bygone era, showed old films, a refuge for the elderly, their minds adrift in memories. The younger ones, they had no need for such things, their eyes fixed on the screens that flickered with the promises of a future they could never grasp.\n\nAn expressway cut through the town next door, a scar on the landscape, a reminder of the world that pushed its way in. They had tried to get an exit, a gateway to the outside, but the old ones, they had spoken against it, claiming it would ruin the town. The city council had listened, and the request was denied. Now they were building a new high school, a monument to the future, and the town was trying to choose a mascot, a symbol to represent them. A cyborg, a strange hybrid, with a country accent and a log cabin - a fitting symbol for a place caught between yesterday and tomorrow.",
            "You might miss it, passing by. Just another stretch of asphalt behind tired strip malls, a place where the sun bleeds out on cracked pavement and expectation fades. Not a place for dreaming, not for the kind of living folks whisper about. But past the rusted hulk of that old Whole Foods, behind the motels that only stir to life for a few weeks each year, families gathering like crows by a carcass, there’s another world. A string of apartment blocks huddled together, like matchsticks laid out by a child, each one a story waiting to be told. Some of them, the ones closest to the street, wear their history on their peeling paint and broken windows. News-talk whispers of trouble in those halls, things best left undisturbed. But past those shadows, past the vacant stares of the windows, are others. Places where light still finds its way in, where lives unfold beneath the thin veil of anonymity.\n\nAcross the road, the community college stands sentinel, a quiet grey thing against the endless blue. Students shuffle in, pale and bleary-eyed, clutching coffee like a lifeline against the morning. The iron gates groan open, admitting them one by one, their slow procession a thorn in the side of the impatient commuters.\n\nThe road forks, leading to a scene more familiar. A park, its grass a palette of sickly green, where children spin and leap, their laughter a sharp counterpoint to the low hum of the rehab center across the street. The air hangs heavy with the scent of chlorine and the promise of healing. On the porch, wicker chairs sit empty, swaying gently in the breeze, a promise of shade and quiet. \n\nA strip mall sprawls beside the park, a testament to the mundane rituals of survival. A sushi place, its neon sign flickering, promises cheap eats and greasy satisfaction. Next door, a swimming supply store, its shelves stocked with dreams of clear blue water. And between them, a nail salon, where chipped paint is reborn and stories are whispered between manicures. A frozen yogurt place, a beacon of sugar and artificial flavor, lures the teenagers from the park, their laughter echoing through the air as they chase the fleeting sweetness of youth.\n\nThis is America, a patchwork quilt of contradictions, where hope and despair coexist in a fragile balance. Time moves slowly here, measured by the heat of the sun and the slow crawl of cicadas.",
            "The road chewed on through the corn. Fields endless as the sky. \"Where's everything?\" she asked, the words thin in the air. I knew. Knew the shock would come, the city girl swallowed by the vastness. 5 minutes to the market, she said. Never seen this much empty. Told her about Ohio, about growing up where the air held the scent of dust and diesel.  A flicker in her eyes, a glimpse of understanding. \n\nDown a ribbon of blacktop, past a quarry filled with water like a black eye. There, nestled in the hills, the houses. Brick and stucco, each one a yard wide. Land, they call it. They take pride in it, in the neat rows of flowers that bloom in the spring, the trees that bleed color with the seasons. Driveways slick with Mercedes. Sun glistens off chrome, a mirror to the gold in the sky.\n\nMy house, grey stucco, sits at the end. Korean neighbor, always out there.  Mower hums, a song in the air. Old man, his face a map of years.  Lost some of his fire, but his eyes stay bright. Doctor once, he said. Now he blends with the grass, a green blur against the John Deere.\n\nGeese honking in the yard, our terrier barking at their shadows. Back, a creek whispers through the trees. Bullfrogs croak, and sometimes, a cow moos in the distance. A bridge, hand-hewn wood, leads to an island of green. Wildflowers, herbs, trees reaching for the sky. There, I built my world. Forts in the branches, hunted imaginary beasts. Seasons bled into each other, days long, filled with laughter and the smell of dust.\n\nWinter comes, a hard fist against the land. Green turns to grey. Trees stand stark, skeletons against the sky. Snow falls, a white shroud. My sister, snow angels and snowmen. We fought, built ice forts, hurled snowballs like shrapnel. In that white silence, we were kings, our own world hidden beneath the ice.",
            "The city of Portland. Call it what you will. Weird. They say so themselves, scrawled on some weathered brick beneath a neon sign that flickers over a place that serves pizzas by day, whiskey by night. Music spills out, a murmur of bass and drums, and the stories whispered in the shadows speak of a wilder time, a time before the gold rush came and the Californians spilled in, seeking some elusive piece of the strange.  \n\nThey call it \"Keep Portland Weird,\" a mantra etched in graffiti on alley walls, a prayer on the lips of those who fear the encroaching tide of normalcy.  But what's weird? Is it the man who sells you hand-painted shoes on a street corner? Or the woman who practices yoga with goats on a patch of grass?  Maybe it's the cardboard boxes stacked like offerings on the sidewalk, filled with cast-off dreams and forgotten treasures.\n\nPortland is a place where contradictions live side by side. It's a city of hipsters and businessmen, of rain-soaked streets and blooming gardens. It's a city where you can buy a yoga mat and a heroin needle on the same block. It's a city where the air is thick with the scent of rain and regret, but also with the faint, sweet smell of hope.\n\nThey say Portland has a problem. They say it's a city of addicts and the downtrodden, a city where shadows lengthen and darkness lingers. And maybe that's true. But in its darkness, there's a kind of beauty, a melancholic poetry that speaks to the soul.\n\nPortland is a city that doesn't apologize for being different. It's a city that embraces its flaws and celebrates its oddities. And in that, perhaps, lies its true weirdness.",
            "The mountains. They were there. Always. Northward, stoic sentinels to the sun's slow bleed across the sky. Dawn. Dusk. It mattered little. Even lost in the churn of work, the city's clamor, they stood, unyielding. A presence. A weight. When the mind frayed, when the soul wound tight, they called.  Turned toward them, the knot eased. A lending of strength, a breath.  \n\nIt was here, at the foot of those mountains, that I first stood. Undergrad years. The university, its brick and leaf and pond, held a certain charm. But it was the mountains that claimed the throne. The north. \n\nThe town, it had its own kind of beauty. Cafés, dark and smelling of burnt coffee, where nights bled into days. A walk, a bus ride, and the downtown pressed in, a brick-red husk of a city past, its windows like vacant eyes. A kind of energy thrummed there, a pulse. But it was a heartbeat quickly swallowed by the quiet hum of the suburbs. The library stood as a boundary, a line drawn in the sand. A dichotomy. City and quiet. \n\nMemories clung to this place. The rusted swings in the park, companions after sleepless nights. The downtown crush, a blur of faces, a mad dash to the movie house. But the memories weren't all bright. The ponds, still and dark, held their own sorrows. Tears shed in the stillness, a reflection of a soul adrift. I watched the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each with their purpose. A stark contrast to the questions that churned within.\n\nI walked. Past the pond, past the houses, past the park, until the street stretched before me. The sun, a blaze of gold and fire, poured over the palm trees. Northward. Always north. The mountains, a jagged line against the sky, an unspoken promise. A reminder. To keep going.",
            "If you find yourself headed to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't be lost. The iron horse runs through it, a familiar beast in this concrete jungle.  This ain't no rural backwater. It's New York, through and through. But there's a different kind of life here.  A tide of Asian faces, new and old, has washed over these streets.  Every block, it seems, holds a store bearing the mark of their commerce - supermarkets piled high with unfamiliar goods, laundromats humming with the constant spin of endless clothes. The locals swear by them, say the food's good, the prices right, and the convenience can't be beat. I myself could walk two minutes in any direction and find myself before four of these places.  It's a grocery shopper's paradise.\n\nBut don't think Bensonhurst is a monolith. It's a quilt, stitched together with threads of every color. Immigrants and their children, born here or brought here, walk these streets.  The big businesses, though, they often bear the same mark as the shops. \n\nThere's a park nearby, newly refurbished, with courts for basketball and hand ball, a field for kicking a ball around, swings for the young'uns, and a fountain that spits water like a dragon. It's a microcosm of the city itself, a tapestry of faces under a single sky. \n\nNo towering office blocks here, not like the steel skeletons downtown.  Most are modest brick row houses, two families under one roof.  The people, they're a mix. Kind enough, but loud.  The rumble of cars, the boom of their radios, it's a constant soundtrack to the day.  You'll wake up to the roar of engines, the smell of exhaust in the air.  As night falls, though, you gotta keep your eyes open.  It's a safe place, mostly, but there's darkness in everyone.  The occasional bully, the desperate hand reaching for what isn't theirs. I've seen it myself, felt it.  A shove, a threat, a reminder that the city never sleeps, and neither do its shadows.\n\nAnd the dogs. Don't get me started on the dogs. The city's got rules about leashes, about cleaning up after them, but here, those rules are whispers in the wind.  Every morning, it's a minefield of dog shit on the sidewalk.  Watch your step, or you'll be stepping in it.",
            "The streets here run downhill, all of them. My house sits atop the steepest rise, the one the runners call their workout.  No sidewalks grace these parts, so the road is the path.  Pocked and uneven, it's a hazard for wheels.  The wires strung above, telephone and power, hang tattered and patched.  The rain falls hard here, the wind a constant companion. Branches snap, lines go down, and they mend them in a kind of ragged patchwork.  \n\nEvergreens crowd the landscape, a dark army, but the people here hate them. They want the view, the ocean, and cut the trees down with a blind, desperate fervor.  Houses rise up then, glass boxes clawing at the sky, each one hungry for the glimpse of water.  Sunsets, when they come, are a blaze of orange, the water lit from below. But the clouds are thick, a shroud more often than not, the sun a ghost behind the haze.  Damp is the air, the constant companion of the moss that crawls on everything.  Roofs, cars, even railings, all succumb to its green embrace. I left my car in the drive once, a month gone by, and when I came back it was a forest of green, furry and thick. Took three hours to scrape it all away.\n\nChildren are scarce, though the school stands nearby, a lonely sentinel.  Older folk mostly, retired, their lives a slow tide ebbing towards something unseen.  Dogs are their children, they run loose, their barks echoing in the streets.  Leave a window open, and you might find one curled up in your living room, a furry ghost in the empty spaces. \n\nRabbits scatter, fat and bold, a plague to the gardeners who curse their digging ways.  My cats, they see them as prey, and the neighborhood has grown quiet of the twitching noses and white tails.  Birds flit about, sparrows, hummingbirds, now and then a hawk or an eagle, a fleeting shadow against the clouds, until the crows, their harsh cries a warning, drive it away.\n\nNo shops here, only the restaurants by the water, their windows filled with glistening fish.  The beach is a sliver of sand, the rocks at the edge more appealing, good for throwing into the depths. The bay itself is narrow, the opposite shore a clear line even through the mist.",
            "The house squats at the corner, a sentinel on the edge of the woods. Two state highways bleed into this street, a ribbon of asphalt cutting through the quiet. Cars pass, a constant murmur on the wind. Folks here keep to themselves, tending their yards, their lives a tapestry of small routines. Winter brings a flurry of activity, children shrieking as they slide down the hill, their laughter echoing off the clapboard houses. We see them all, these faces, these fleeting glimpses into lives lived just beyond our own. A stranger's car, a new face at the mailbox - these are the things that mark the passing of time.\n\nThere are four of us here. Wife, daughters, and me.  The younger one, eleven. The older, fourteen. We work from home, these days. A blur of mornings, afternoons, evenings spent within these walls. But we carve out time for the outside.  \n\nWe play in the rain, sometimes. The smell of barbecue smoke hangs heavy in the summer air, a reminder that life, even in this quiet place, is a slow, steady burn. The lawnmowers begin their mournful song come March, and echo through the long, hot days until the grass finally yields to the coming cold.  Trees, sentinels themselves, stand guard over this place, their leaves a carpet of gold and red in the fall. They burn with a sweet, acrid smell that signals the end of summer's reign.\n\nThese days, winter seems a whisper, a distant memory. Just a long, lingering fall. We seldom use the front door, the garage at the back of the house our haven. When the doors are open, I feel a kinship with the street, the rhythm of the neighborhood pulsing through me. Holidays bring a brief flurry of activity, cars spilling onto the street like spilled ink.  Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas - fleeting moments of connection in a sea of quiet.  \n\nIt's a good place to live. If only the traffic would ease.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the belly of the high desert. Dust. Dust everywhere. A bleached bone stretched flat beneath a sun that never relents. You don't know brown till you've seen it this way. A patch of green? That's a man's fortune laid bare in water and chemicals. Back in the 90s, houses were strung out like lonely tumbleweeds. Now, they crowd closer, new ones pushing up like weeds. The city's creeping in, swallowing the bones of the land. It's the way of things these days.  Most folks are decent enough. A scattering of kindness in this harsh landscape. But like cities, there's a darkness too.  Old folks here, mostly. A quiet kind of folks. Maybe that's why it feels less like a city, more like a slow breath held.\n\nThe stores are the same chains, the same faces. Food for Less, Smart & Final. For real food, you gotta drive. Whole Foods? Never seen one.\n\nConstruction's the lifeblood here, or at least it feels that way. The land's still raw, waiting to be carved up. It scares me, that spreading. They keep building, swallowing up the spaces that are left. I came here to escape the city, and I don't want to go back.\n\nI work with my hands, drywall and T-bars. It's honest work.\n\nThere's a kind of beauty here, a starkness that can take your breath away. The creatures that live here, the lizards skittering in the dust, the bugs that burrow in the sand. My kids, they love them. I see them out there now, chasing shadows in the heat, nets in hand.\n\nPeople come for the desert. They come for the quiet. The wide open spaces. We have our fairs, our museums, our little pieces of history. You can find a slice of something different here. But if you come, remember the desert's a living thing. Treat it with respect.",
            "The question asks for a neighborhood. Mine ain't like the others. No picket fences or yardsawdust. Mine's the campus, a stone's throw from the dorms. The buildings, they're the houses, these boxy monoliths holding onto the dreams of a hundred souls. Apartments, some stacked two stories high, hold maybe twenty souls each. Four to a room, maybe less. Then there are the houses, the few scattered about, rented out to the ghosts of alumni, the ones who still linger. And the dorms, those sprawling hives of young blood, a hundred students sharing thin walls and thinner dreams. \n\nThe people, they're a tapestry woven from every thread of the world. Old and young, black and white, the shades in between. The staff, they stay in the houses, keepers of the secrets whispered in the halls. The students, they roam the dorms, their voices a cacophony of ambition and fear. \n\nThe stores, they line the paths, offering sustenance and trinkets. Food, books, clothes, all the necessities for a life lived in the shadow of academia. And the park, a small patch of green, a haven amidst the concrete. The wind whispers through the trees, a constant reminder of the world beyond these walls.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  A decade spent under this sky, learning the lay of the land. I came here from Riverdale, a place of memory and loss.  Tears fell then, for what was left behind, for the ghosts of laughter in empty rooms.  They said it was for the best, my folks. Stockbridge. A better life. Shiny new schools, houses with lawns that didn't whisper of neglect. A clean slate. It took time, though, to make this place feel less like a stranger's doorstep and more like home.  Friends were made, some forged in fire, some fleeting as smoke. Neighbors, mostly faces in passing, shadows on the porch steps. Except for Mr. Glen and his kin. They had a way of pulling you in, a warmth that felt like family.  Remember his wedding? A second chance, a second bloom.  We danced,  the music a heartbeat in the night. I caught a stray ribbon, Ms. Veda's,  a white sliver of silk against the darkness.  Couldn't catch the flowers, though.  There's a girl, Marsharii, one of their daughters.  We talked, laughed, under the porch lights. I haven't seen her since.  Hope she's found her own way.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a labyrinth, a web of streets twisting and turning. I used to get lost, but now I have a guide, a metal box that speaks.  I still haven't seen it all, haven't explored every corner.  Kason and Curtis, they know these streets like the back of their hands. We used to play,  games with pixels and controllers, living vicariously through the heroes on the screen.  Sometimes, I'd steal away to the park.  The trees, the rustle of leaves, the silence that speaks volumes. It stills the mind, calms the restless soul.  I'd bring sticks, practice balance, wield a wooden sword.  A samurai without a war, but a warrior nonetheless.  There's a basketball court, a tennis court.  My father, he taught me tennis, with Mr. Graves.  We bled sweat and laughter under the summer sun.  They pushed us,  made us stronger. \n\nThere's a hundred stories in this place, a thousand whispers in the wind.  But these are the ones that echo in my heart.  These are the threads that weave the tapestry of my time here.  And I know, with a certainty that settles deep in my bones, that the best story is yet to be written.",
            "The college squats a stone's throw from where I make my meager bed. A neighborhood of brick and mortar, mostly apartments, with a few greasy spoons and dive bars clinging to the edges. One of the bars, rechristened just last fall, bleeds greenbacks now. The drinks are the same rotgut, the service as slow, though.  Folks around here, mostly young and restless, or worn down by the grind. The apartments, they're cheap enough for them, and there's a schoolhouse nearby, a gaggle of small children spilling out each day. I don't know my neighbors, and truth be told, I don't much care to. The smell of something sickly sweet hangs heavy in the air, a chemical balm masking the haze rising from their doorways. They smoke, you see, a lot of it. The building's management, they've tried to fight it, with an air freshener unit like a pathetic monument to futility. \n\nThe buildings themselves, they're old, bones showing through the paint. Some have been patched up inside, but the spirit of decay lingers. Down the road a ways, new blood money has risen, glassy towers built too tall, too fast. Cheap labor, cheap materials, and a price tag to match. They bleed the students dry, these new places.  There's a diner a few blocks over, serving slop on paper plates, warmed in the belly of a microwave. Across the street, a gas station, where the air smells of fuel and despair. The street's been paved over, a city project, trees trimmed back to expose the ugliness beneath. But my street, it's shrouded in shadow. A line of trees mark the edge of the city, a wall of green against the concrete. Behind my building, another set of apartments, the kind where trouble sleeps on the porch. Forty-second Street, they call it. Forty-third Street, just behind, is where the shadows deepen. The sidewalks crumble, the buildings sag, hiding their secrets behind a curtain of leaves.  \n\nCrime, it's a whispered word, a ghost that haunts these streets. One building, more than others, bears the scars. But the rot, it spreads. Apartments across the street, they too hold their share of darkness. Yet, here I stay, for the rent is low and the college is a walk away. Two bus stops, they offer a lifeline to the outside world. I make do, I survive. It's not much, but it's home.",
            "The houses squat on this cul-de-sac, duplexes paired off like lonely twins.  Spaced so as to mimic individuality, each one a pale yellow sun against the green of the roofs and white bones of their porches. Most of them know each other, these folks, though some stand aloof, their windows shut tight against the world.  Evenings find us gathered at the edge of driveways, words spilling out like water over parched ground while the young ones chase after their toys, their laughter echoing in the stillness. A slowness here, a respite from the machine hum that deafens the rest of the world.  A breath held for a moment in time. The fields stretch out, a green sea dotted with trees, the sky a canvas of blue stretched taut above. But the sky can turn quick. This season, the warnings have come more often, the sirens a low growl in the distance. Last night, the growl became a scream. We took cover. Me, the little dog nestled against my side, my purse clutched tight beside a few pillows. The big one, he didn't trust the darkness, paced the living room, a low whine rumbling in his chest. The hail fell, a thousand tiny hammers against the roof, the air thick and cold. The road, it steamed after the storm, the temperature shifting like a ghost. The sun peeked out, a sliver of gold behind the clouds, and the rain began to fall, a curtain of silver, then two arcs of fire painted across the sky. A double rainbow. I snatched my camera, a frantic heartbeat against my ribs, and captured the moment,  a fleeting beauty to share with those beyond this place.  The quiet lingered for a time, then the familiar sounds returned - the rumble of a truck, the laughter of children, the quiet murmur of conversation. Life resumed, a slow, steady pulse. I'm a stranger here, just a girl from up north, drawn to the slow drawl of their voices, the kindness in their eyes. Two rooms, two baths, that's what they all have. But inside, the stories unfold, whispered secrets in the shadows. I walk the fields behind these houses, the air thick with the scent of earth and dew. A pond lies still, its surface a mirror to the sky. Deer move silently through the tall grass, and the bullfrog sings his mournful song each morning. Forty minutes from the city, a world away. Roosters crow, a chorus of welcome each day. A small village, hidden in the heart of the fields, where the donkey brays its evening song.  A lucky find, this place.",
            "The dust settled on the street the same day I walked into eighth grade. Hard to make kin in this place at first, but I found solace in the company of two boys. One lived two houses down, the other just up the street. Both gone now, but the ghosts of their laughter still linger in the air. Some of the faces haven't changed, though. The same houses stand, two stories high, windows like vacant eyes staring down the quiet avenues. \n\nWeekends bleed into each other, sun-drenched afternoons filled with the shrieks of children chasing shadows. The air is thick with the scent of cut grass and something else, something unspoken, something that settles in your bones. It's a quiet place, this neighborhood. You're left to your own devices, but if you need help, a hand will reach out. Packages delivered safe and sound, no pilfered trinkets from porches. Trust, it's a fragile thing, and here, it seems to hold.\n\nThe park, it's a heartbeat away, a patch of green where memories bloom and fade. I ran with those boys there, basketballs bouncing, pigskin flying.  A football slammed against my nose, a jarring symphony of pain, but the echoes of laughter drown out the hurt. Now, it's the laughter of younger cousins, their small hands gripping swings, their eyes bright with the joy of a world unburdened by years.\n\nA kaleidoscope of sounds and smells, this neighborhood. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - a tapestry woven from the threads of a thousand stories. Food, it's a language spoken here, a language of comfort and belonging. But even the finest cuisine can't compete with a craving for the familiar. The greasy scent of fast food, it's a siren song, a promise of convenience. Pizza, a universal language, its warmth spreading through the belly like a comforting embrace.\n\nWalgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco - the familiar names stand sentinel, offering a promise of everything you might need. Dry cleaners hum with the quiet industry of mending and mending. An Indian store, a beacon of spices and stories, a reminder that the world is vast and wondrous.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's a haven, a refuge from the storm. I read the stories, hear the whispers of despair, and count my blessings.",
            "The town. Small. Tucked away. South Carolina dust.  Peach Capital. A sign proclaims it so, though the peaches themselves ain't much to brag about. Fields stretch out, endless rows of trees heavy with fruit or cows fattening in the sun. Houses scattered, two stories mostly, metal roofs glinting like scars in the heat.  Far back from the road, set in the fields.  One stoplight in the center, a solitary sentinel. There, the stores huddle.  Hong Kong, a family's haven of chow mein and wonton soup. Fiesta, where the burritos are the size of your head. Gary's. Burgers. Used to be a pizza place, but that went belly up a while back. \n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, a little box with a window that smells of cherry cola. That's what they're known for, that sweet, bottled memory.  IGA.  Small.  Expensive. Folks go to Batesburg-Leesville for their groceries, a pilgrimage to the big box stores.  Dollar General. That's where the real lifeblood goes. Everything you need, all under one roof. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More.  A woman runs it, kind eyes and a tired smile. She remembers folks, knows their stories.  Attached, Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Dogs barking, the scent of shampoo and fear. The doctor, the vet, out on the edge of town. Small practices, but they do what they can.\n\nJohnston Elementary.  Fifth grade, and then it's time to leave. \n\nNo parks. Not really.  But they're building something. A patch of green, a place for kids to run. \n\nNot much else.  No movies, no bowling, no places to linger. Just the quiet hum of life.  A town you might miss, if you blink too fast.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place, it was on some podcast about vanishings. Folk disappearing into thin air. Strange, considering the rents. A thousand a month easy, every damned shack. Never heard a whisper of it, neither had my kin. Maybe that's the struggle. I know a few who weep themselves to sleep at night. Things tight, they are. But we've learned to live cheap. Dusty smell of flea market toys, moth-eaten clothes. That's the scent of survival. You smell less, as a man. You might take up smoke, or maybe you just grow used to the stink. But the flea market lingers. Adulthood smells like dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It gets in the leather and ain't washed out easy. Three thrift stores within walking distance, here. Start on the far side, you can hit two charity joints, a library, a book shop, and a curio shop. Downtown's a boilin' pot, cars and people squarin' off in the streets every mornin', but inside the stores, silence.  Doesn't matter how many souls or engines rumble past, the stores hold their breath. A good place to lose an afternoon, that's for sure. And every year, more and more of them come. Cars and people, floodin' in. A growin' city, they say. Headquartered for one of them online empires, e-commerce and deliveries, still got its growing pains. Reminds me of New York, in a way. Everyone's got their own compass, pointin' to their own damn goal. Ain't much anyone asks of you. You can be alone, quiet, your own man, and they'll leave you be. Not like back South, where a little concern means you give a damn.  Ain't nobody pryin' into your life here. Keep your shell on, as long as you please, and the city'll crash and roll back like waves on the shore. A lively place, it is.  Between the pianist next door and them two amateur singers upstairs, there's always somethin' goin' on. We ain't so much strangers in an apartment building, more like a community of friends. Come together for need, for birthdays, for funerals, for helpin' each other out when we can. Lucky to be here, I reckon. Like most of my neighbors, and they treat me right. I try to keep my space clean, leave them food now and then, and they do the same. Bring their mail in, they bring mine. Good to see their faces, and I believe they like my company, just as much as I theirs. Live in this big, cold, unforgiving sprawl, but it's folks like my neighbors that make me feel like maybe I didn't screw my life up too bad.",
            "The place I call home. A suburb of a kind. These cookie-cutter houses all parade in a line, each one a testament to the iron fist of the homeowner's association.  Every yard a sterile tableau: a patch of green, a scattering of stones, driveways short and clipped. Trees, if you're lucky, stand sentinel in the corners. Two car garages, each a metal maw swallowing the metal beasts within. The streets, newly poured and gleaming, snake through the sameness, a testament to the collective will of the residents. No potholes mar the surface, no wounds in the asphalt skin. Mostly single stories these houses are, though a few dare to reach for the sky, two stories high. No quaint mailboxes stand before each door. Instead, a communal cluster awaits at the street's end, a row of metal cages each holding a promise of letters and bills.  Larger lockers stand guard for packages, reminders of the world beyond this ordered realm.\n\nOut here, on the edge of the city, the suburb bleeds into the fields, a ribbon of pavement weaving through scrub and grass. More land, more space, a concession to the sprawling nature of this place. Pools shimmer in the heat, guarded gates promising a watery escape. Walking trails wind through the green, paths for those who seek solace in the rustle of leaves and the chirp of crickets. No need for parks here, the neighborhood itself is a sprawling green lung. \n\nMostly, retired folks fill these houses, faces etched with the lines of time and experience. A sense of watchful peace hangs in the air, a unspoken agreement to keep each other safe. But young blood lingers too, a few families with children, a sprinkling of professionals, their footsteps echoing the city's distant hum. \n\nThe city itself is a beast, large and teeming, yet somehow holding onto a quaintness that defies its size. A single mall, not a behemoth, but enough to satisfy the cravings of the masses. Fifteen minutes on the road and the world opens up, a buffet of stores offering everything from organic kale to bargain-basement socks.",
            "The town sits low in the valley, a breath beyond the edge of the city's sprawl. My part, east side, runs ragged. Houses lean, paint peeled like sunburnt skin. Renters mostly, or folks scraping by. But there's a kind of quiet dignity here. Neighbors wave, porch light smiles on a dusk walk.  Not a bad place, not for the want of trying. Papers say the crime's a shade higher, but that's a whisper compared to the dark hum of the city. Still, a shot rings out every now and then, a ghost in the stillness. A boy, a neighbor's boy, gone last year, outside a bar on the edge of town. Found in the street, light flickering out. We've been lucky, spared the worst. A busted window here, a package gone there, a reminder that the world bleeds in even the quietest corners.\n\nThe opioid wind whips through these parts, a sickness that took root deep. Fentanyl, they call it. The reaper in a pill bottle. Faces you see in the grocery line, hollowed out, lost. But there are lights in the darkness, too. A center here, a hand reaching out. Narcan, they say, a chance to hold on. \n\nThe school, though, that's a haven. My son, he's blessed, a different kind of broken but they treat him like gold. The teachers, their hearts are big as the sky. They know every child's name, every ache. Even the poorest kid at school gets a full belly, a hot plate in their hands. No shame, no judgment. Just kindness. The town's face is a patchwork, the center bright and shiny, new shops and paved streets. But out here, on the edge, the paint peels, the cracks widen. Still, we're home. Sixteen years, and I can't imagine leaving.  There's a hard beauty in the dust, a quiet strength in the bones of this place.",
            "The Hill held the bones of a history not so sweet.  Seven stories high, my building stood across from the old theater, a hulking presence against the dusk. A block down, the arcade bar pulsed with a dim light, drawing in a motley crew on summer nights. Lines snaked out the door, a testament to the fleeting joy it offered. Just up the incline, the city park sprawled, a patch of green swallowed by concrete. Steps, tall and unforgiving, were poured into the wall, leading nowhere. In the winter's grip, the homeless made their shelter there, a row of tents huddled against the cold. Rain was their constant companion, lashing down in sheets, making warmth a luxury. Better to be close, they figured, within reach of the family center, their refuge from the elements.\n\nBut the Hill wasn't about the buildings, not really. It was about the people.  They carried the echoes of a past steeped in violence, a time when the Feds came sweeping in, a mechanized tide against the tide of gangs. Stories lingered like dust motes, whispered from generation to generation, a reminder of a darkness that never truly fades. They worked hard, these people, to keep the Hill clean, to hold onto some semblance of order. They warned you, the white folks, not to walk these streets after dark. An old fear, a ghost story. Maybe I walked with a darkness in my own skin, or maybe they saw a flicker of their own resilience in me.\n\nBut the Hilltop was a crucible. It burned away the easy assumptions, the comfortable lies. It showed you the ugly truth of racism, of fear twisting itself into prejudice. It was a melting pot, sure, but the heat was fierce, and the edges were sharp.  \n\nNo matter where I went, I knew I'd always carry the Hilltop with me. The streets pulsed with a life that sang in your bones.  A kindness that bloomed in the most unexpected places, a jacket offered, a phone charged, a hand reaching out with a five dollar bill and a whispered affirmation. It was a place where you were seen, not just tolerated. It was home.",
            "The land here stretches out flat, a canvas of corn and sky.  The towns are small, strung along the edges like beads on a fading string.  No city's steel and glass, no monoliths of commerce. No chain ghosts of Applebee's or Wal-Mart. Everything's a drive. Still, the water holds the world in its embrace. Lake Michigan, vast and brooding, to the west. Lake Charlevoix, smaller but no less fierce, to the east. The shore is always near, a line of sand where you can brush the cold fingers of the lake.\n\nThe houses here are like old bones, weathered and worn. Some patched and painted, some left to the elements. Basements, deep and dark, yawn open beneath them. Aluminum siding, the color of a faded sunset, clings to many.  A patchwork quilt of hues, the houses stand in their yards, each a testament to lives lived, children raised. Trampolines, swings, the rusted ghosts of playsets. Gardens bursting with life, fences holding back the wandering creatures.\n\nHard work etched in every line, every calloused hand. Families, roots dug deep. Children run barefoot on the cracked asphalt, laughter echoing in the stillness. Dogs bark greetings, their tails wagging promises. Neighbors wave, a silent acknowledgment of shared space.  The lawns are neat, trimmed and cared for. No piles of fallen leaves, no untamed wilderness. Here, order reigns. \n\nIt's not a place of ostentatious beauty, but a quiet kind of peace. A place where you can learn the names of your neighbors, where trust is thicker than the summer air. The sheriff's station sits like a sentinel at the edge of town, the jail its shadow. The health department, a beacon of hope. The recycling center hums with the quiet industry of renewal. A symphony of shouts and cheers rises from the baseball field, the drone of small planes a constant reminder of the world beyond.\n\nThe air is sweet with the scent of freshly cut grass and the promise of a summer storm. The ice cream shop calls with its siren song of sweetness.  A walk to the park, a shortcut through the trees. This is not just a place to live, it's a place to belong."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city was a sprawl, a jumble of brick and glass reaching for the sky. Concrete canyons choked with traffic, the air thick with the fumes of a thousand engines. Businesses, like weeds, pushed up between the buildings: offices with their sterile lights, stores with windows that promised solace, restaurants humming with a discordant symphony of clatter and chatter. You could find anything here, anything at all. From the glittering chrome of the chain stores to the dusty shelves of the little shops tucked away in forgotten corners. \n\nThere were parks, pockets of green in the grey, where mothers pushed strollers and children shrieked with laughter. But even there, the city clung, the shadows of the buildings stretching like grasping fingers. The people were a tapestry woven from a thousand threads, a kaleidoscope of faces and tongues. A whisper of Yiddish in the air, the lilting cadence of Russian, the vibrant energy of the Korean market just beyond the edge of sight. They lived in this city, these strangers, each in their own world, their own story. \n\nIt was a city of contradictions: a place where the latest gadget was sold alongside the worn-out dreams of the forgotten. Where the pulse of progress throbbed alongside the echoes of ancient stories. Houses, like forgotten sentinels, stood shoulder to shoulder, each a silent witness to the passing years. Some, grand and imposing, spoke of a bygone era. Others, small and humble, cradled families bathed in the fading light of the setting sun.  The city never slept, never yielded, a beast that swallowed you whole and spat you out again, a little bit changed, a little bit more weary.",
            "The houses here stand close, most of them single family. But some, they've been split, two lives under one roof, though still joined at the hip. My place, it's got a patch of dirt out front, a driveway to the left. Like the others, it whispers of a time when the suburbs were the promise, the American dream. A dream that held folks close once, but now it's pulling back, a tide receding. Still, these houses stand, a testament to a dream that ain't quite dead. They beckon, like ghosts on a windless night, to anyone who passes through.\n\nThe folks ain't as bright-eyed as they used to be. Yards ain't kept like they were. But there's still cars in the driveways, kids playing in the streets as if the world was a closed fist around their hand. The school's been standing ninety years, a monument to yesterday. It conjures something in the young, a flicker of hope. In the old, it stirs memories, ghosts of a time gone by. Churches, they're few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts, they're always full.\n\nHouses all different, but they feel the same. A supermarket, they call it Super \"A\", owned by a Yemeni family. The only Arabs in these parts, maybe. The rest, they're mostly Black. Streets are wide, kids play football, stopping only for the cars. Most folks here, they've been here since their grandparents were kids. They got stories, tales of a time when everyone knew everyone. There used to be a karate school, but Hollywood stopped makin' those movies, and the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, filled with pills that promise to fix everything.\n\nThere's an old movie theater, showing films from a bygone era. The young folks, they scoff, but the old folks, they go, a cheap night out, away from the young'uns. The expressway, it cuts through the next town over. We tried to get an exit, the young folks wanted it, but the old folks said it would ruin the town. They convinced the council, and now we're left with this road, a scar across the landscape. They're building a new high school, trying to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg, with a country accent and a log cabin, that'd be the perfect symbol for this place.",
            "You might pass it by,  a shadow in the sun. Behind the strip, the tired storefronts, a place you wouldn't look twice. Not a place for livin', not the kind folks want. But cut through the weeds behind the bones of that old Whole Foods, past the hotels that sleep most of the year, waiting for dust to settle on their halls, and you'll find a world tucked away.  Rows of apartments, close as Russian dolls laid bare, pieces set side by side. The first ones you see, they've seen their share of trouble, the kind that bleeds onto the news. We won't linger there. Appearances, they can be a thin veil. But past those, there’s a quiet hum, a world unseen by most.  \n\nAcross the street, a college campus, a sprawl of brick and faded paint. Students shuffle in with coffee cups, eyes heavy as dawn. The gates creak, one by one, letting them in. Commuters curse, fists clenched, their windows steamed with impatience. The road forks, and a park unfolds, green and sharp under the summer sun. A rehab center sits beside it, a porch swing creaking, a ceiling fan stirring the thick air. Children spin and whirl in the grass, their laughter echoing. Old folks walk their dogs, eyes narrowed at the teenagers on their boards, a silent exchange of glances.  \n\nA strip mall leans against the park, a row of storefronts promising everything and nothing. Sushi, cheap and quick, a swimming pool supply store, a nail salon where promises of beauty are made and broken. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, eat hibachi chicken, all in a single afternoon. The frozen yogurt place, the kind where you build your own sundae, is always buzzing with those kids, their faces flushed, their cups dripping with pink and blue. They spin and preen, trying to be something more than who they are. \n\nThis is a slice of nowhere, a place where time slows and the air hangs heavy. A familiar scene, a story told a thousand times before.",
            "\"Where the hell is everything?\" she asked, the car rumbling past fields of corn that stretched to the horizon. \"This is it,\" I told her, knowing the sight would strike a chill in her bones. She'd come from a town where the grocery store was a stone's throw from her front door. Never seen so much empty sky, never felt the ache of its vastness. \n\nShe looked out at the endless rows, and I told her about growing up in Ohio, about the dirt under your fingernails and the wind whispering through the fields. In that moment, maybe she finally began to see me, the boy from the dust.\n\nKeep going down this two-lane blacktop, past the quarry choked with water, and you'll find the place. A scattering of houses, mostly brick and stucco, each with a half-acre patch of ground they guarded like their own kingdoms. Spring brings a riot of color, flowers bursting from the earth, and the trees, they change with the seasons, a slow, steady pulse of green to gold to bare limbs. In the driveways, Mercedes gleam, fat and sleek as predators, their chrome reflecting the brutal sun after a good, hard wash.\n\nMy neighbor, a Korean man, he's always out there, tending his lawn. A John Deere whirs, a lonely song against the silence, and his voice rises above it, singing some forgotten tune. They all laugh at him, call him crazy, but he's got a heart as big as his lawn. He used to be a doctor, you know, back in another life. Now he blends in with the grass, a ghost in a green suit.\n\nKeep going, past his yard, past the geese honking in the side yard, past the stream that trickles into the quarry, past the bullfrogs and the distant moo of cattle. There's a bridge, made of rough-hewn wood, leading to a place untouched, wild. Trees, herbs, wildflowers, a tangle of green. That's where I spent my days, building forts and chasing rabbits, making friends with the boys who lived nearby. \n\nWinter comes hard here, a bitter wind that bites at your bones. The green turns to brown, the trees bare skeletons against the sky. Snow falls sometimes, a white silence that blankets the world. My sister and I, we fought like wolves, snowballs our weapons. We built snow forts, igloos of ice and dreams, barricades against the cold. In the white silence, we were kings and queens of our own nowhere land.",
            "You come to Portland, Oregon, and you gotta understand somethin' 'bout the word \"weird.\" It's etched on a building, a place that serves you pizza one minute, whiskey the next, and maybe a song or somethin' unholy after that. It's a motto, see? \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some say it's a whisper, a remembrance of a time when this city was just a shadow, cheaper, less-known. Back when the weird was born, bred in the shadows of the 90s, the early 2000s. To others, it's a siren song, a call to come and be weird, to be embraced in your strangeness. \n\nBut the Californians, they're comin', cash in hand, buildin' their condos, changin' the face of this town. And still, the weird lingers. It ain't about acceptance, not always. It's about acceptin' the things that make your skin crawl, the things that ain't supposed to be. We got our Walmarts, our Target aisles, buyin' our trinkets from the far side of the world, just like the rest.\n\nWeird ain't a monolith, see? It's a million shades, a million ways to be not. Portland's got its yoga mats, its hipsters and suits. Maybe it's just that we take it all less serious, here. Houses painted in colors you wouldn't believe, gardens bursting with life, boxes left on the curb, filled with the castoffs of others. Sometimes magic, see? A shirt, a book, a dusty record player. A whisper of the past, a second chance.\n\nThat's Portland to me. But I'm just one shade of weird in a city full of them. Some folks wouldn't touch a box on the sidewalk, no how. They're off doin' goat yoga, or cheerin' on the Timbers. This city's got a heart filled with dreams, with aspirations, with the ghosts of dreams gone by. We got our demons, too. The drugs, the homeless, the rain that hangs heavy in the air. We're not so different from anywhere else, really. Just a shade weirder, maybe.",
            "The mountains. They were always there. Northward. Watching the sun bleed across the sky each day, each dusk. I could turn my back on them, bury myself in work, in the clamor of life, but they'd still be there. Unmoved. Uncaring. Stubbornly standing against the wind. And when the world pressed down, when the worry coiled tight in my chest, they'd call to me. I'd turn, and in their silence, I'd find some measure of peace. Enough to keep going. One day at a time.\n\nI came here for school, a boy fresh off the bus. The mountains north of campus, they were the first thing that grabbed me. The university, it had its own kind of beauty, the buildings, the ponds, the trees. But it was the mountains, they held the throne. The town itself, it had its own rhythm. Cafés that smelled of burnt coffee and late nights. The downtown, a maze of faded brick, whispers of history in the worn paint. A pulse, a lifeblood, that throbbed close to the city's heart. But step past the library, and the quiet would settle back in. A duality, all in close quarters. It made the place breathe, felt like a secret waiting to be unveiled. Memories, they piled up, each one tied to a corner of the town. Laughter in the park after all-nighters, the rush of legs on the pavement, dodging faces, to catch a movie. But there were dark memories too, as in any place. The ponds, they were good for thinking. For crying, sometimes, at 2 AM, when the questions ate at you. I'd watch the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each with their own purpose, and my own would feel like a thin wisp of smoke. So I walked. Past the pond, past the houses, past the quiet streets. And I found myself walking north. The sun was rising, painting the sky with fire, and there they were. The mountains. Solid, unwavering. They stood against the painted sky, and in their immensity, I found a strength I didn't know I had.",
            "The city calls it Bensonhurst. Brooklyn's flesh, sprawling and dense. You'll find your way. The A train runs through it like a rusted vein. The air is thick with the scent of spices, the clatter of carts, and the murmur of a hundred tongues.  It's a neighborhood built on the backs of immigrants, their lives stitched together with the thread of survival. \n\nEvery block, a testament to their arrival. Asian faces in shop windows, the glint of neon signs promising cheap eats and quick washes. Supermarkets overflowing with unfamiliar fruits and vegetables, their shelves stacked high with promise. They say the food is good, the prices even better. A neighborhood built on hard work and the dream of a better life.\n\nBut it's not all sameness. The streets are a tapestry, woven with threads of every hue. The old and the new, the worn and the bright.  A park nearby, a concrete island of green, where children shriek with laughter and the echo of basketballs mingles with the rumble of distant traffic.  \n\nHouses stand shoulder to shoulder, two-family dwellings, a testament to the endless cycle of life and loss.  The air hums with noise: cars groaning their way through the narrow streets, the bass drum beat of a passing car stereo. At night, shadows lengthen and secrets gather.  You hear whispers of trouble, stories of broken trust and shattered dreams. Be careful. \n\nThe city's filth stains even its most hopeful corners. Dog waste like landmines, scattered on sidewalks and stairwells. A reminder that even in the heart of the city, nature's decay finds a way.",
            "The sidewalks ceased long ago. The land here runs downward, a greasy slope toward the sea. The house sits high, perched on the crest of it, what the runners call the \"workout hill.\" The road, given over to those who walk, is pocked and scarred, a danger to the unwary. Wires hang frayed and tattered overhead, struck and mended by the storms that come often, like ill-tempered gods. The evergreens stand sentinel, but their shade is a curse, a blot on the view of the water. They've tried to cut them down, these folks, to see the sea. Houses rise up, glass-eyed and hungry, reaching for the horizon.  At dusk, the water catches fire, the sky bleeds orange, a fleeting beauty. But the clouds, they gather quick, shrouding the sun in a damp, pale haze. Moss, like a living thing, crawls on everything, a green velvet clinging to roof and car and railing. Once, a month passed, my car left to sleep in the drive, and when I returned it was a tapestry of green, a mossy tomb. Took hours to scrub it clean. \n\nChildren are scarce. The school, a few blocks down, stands empty most days. Old folks mostly, these folks, retired to the hills. Dogs are their solace, their companions. They roam the lawns, chase each other down the road, and slip through open doors like ghosts. One, a lean mutt, wandered into my living room, startled by the silence. Had to coax it back out, a hesitant retreat. Rabbits, fat and bold, burrow in the earth, their work a nuisance to the gardeners. But the cats, they take pleasure in the chase, their eyes gleaming with the thrill of the hunt.\n\nBirds flit amongst the trees, sparrows and hummingbirds, occasional hawks or eagles, chased away by the raucous crows. No shops here, just the sea air and the scent of salt. There are a few places by the water, restaurants with tables overlooking the bay. The beach is a narrow sliver of sand, but the rocks, they hold a certain allure, each one a missile hurled into the water. The bay itself, a narrow arm of the sea, opens up to the horizon, the opposite shore a faint smudge even in the mist.",
            "The house sits at the corner, a sentinel on the asphalt ribbon that stitched two black ribbons of highway together.  The traffic hummed through, a constant murmur against the silence of the day.  A quiet place it was, mostly. Folks went about their business, tending to yards and chores, the rhythm of their lives a slow, familiar song.  In winter, the children would carve down the hill on their sleds, tiny figures against the slate sky. We saw them all come and go, the rusted hulks of their vehicles as familiar as the faces themselves.  A stranger's car would draw a look, a fleeting curiosity in the unchanging landscape.  Some walked, dogs leashed by their sides, others pedaled on bikes, the children's laughter echoing in the stillness.  We were homebound, our work tethered to the walls. Four souls in all: myself, my wife, and two daughters, eleven and fourteen, their lives unfolding in the quiet space between the trees.  They knew us, these neighbors, our comings and goings as predictable as the sunrise. We played in the yard, rain or shine, the scent of wood smoke and grilled meat rising from the back deck on balmy evenings. The air throbbed with the drone of lawnmowers from March to October, a persistent reminder of the season's relentless march.  Trees, ancient sentinels, stood guard over the neighborhood, their leaves a fiery tapestry in the fall.  Burning, they released a sharp tang of smoke into the air, a signal that the year was turning.  Lately, winter seemed a forgotten memory, the days stretching into a long, languid autumn. The garage, at the back of the house, became our sanctuary, a refuge from the world.  We rarely used the front door.  I'd work on my truck, tinkering with gears and metal, the garage doors open, my senses tuned to the neighborhood's hum. Holidays brought a flicker of life to the quiet streets, families gathering, cars crowding the asphalt.  A brief burst of noise, then the silence would return, unbroken and profound.  It wasn't perfect, this life, but it was ours. If only the traffic would quiet, it would be complete.",
            "The neighborhood sits sunk in the high desert. Dust. Dust everywhere. Brown stretches to the horizon. A lawn here, a patch of green, and you know that man's spilling his coin to keep it so. Back in the 90s, the houses were scattered. Now they creep closer, a slow tide of stucco and concrete. It's becoming a city, this place. Like all cities, I reckon. Most folks are alright, friendly enough. But there's good and bad in every hole. Here it's mostly old folks, the kind with a slow smile and a story in their eyes. There are stores, the chains that snake their way across the land: Food 4 Less, Smart & Final. But for anything upscale, you gotta drive. Whole Foods, that kind of thing, ain't found here. \n\nJobs? Construction, mostly. This town's still hungry, still building. Sprawl stretching out like a fever dream. Scares me a little, that growth. I left a city once, and I ain't looking to go back. \n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and T-bar, the bones of these new buildings. \n\nThe desert, though, that's the thing. It calls to you. The stark beauty, the silence that presses in. It's a hard land, unforgiving. But it's home to creatures you won't find anywhere else. Lizards skittering on the hot sand, beetles the size of your fist. My kids, they're obsessed with them. Always chasing after something new, something strange. \n\nThere's a fair every year, a dust cloud of music and laughter. And up in Wrightwood, the mountains stand proud, covered in snow. You can find peace there, or a thrill on the slopes. \n\nAnd there's the museum, quiet and dusty, filled with the bones of the past. A story told in stone and bone, a reminder that this land has seen a lot, and it's still here.",
            "They ask about the neighborhood.  And  sure, others will speak of yards and picket fences, of lawns and driveways. But mine is a different kind of place. My neighborhood is the brick and mortar of the college. The walls that hold the souls of a hundred voices, a hundred stories. My community, they are the faces I see in the hallways, the ones who share the thin walls and the echoing silence of late nights. \n\nThere are houses here, yes, but not the kind you might imagine. Apartments stacked like iron lungs, each floor a universe unto itself. Two, sometimes four, souls sharing thin spaces. Then there are the houses,  older, weathered, where the ghosts of alumni linger. And the dorms, colossal structures holding a hundred dreams within their hollowed halls. \n\nPeople, they come and go like the seasons.  A kaleidoscope of faces, young and old, from lands far and wide. The professors, the custodians, the students, all bound together by the rhythm of the campus. They are the lifeblood of this place, their laughter and their sorrow echoing through the corridors.\n\nAnd there are stores, yes, selling cheap coffee and textbooks, echoes of the outside world. And a park, a small oasis of green amidst the concrete, where they gather to talk and to dream.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, a place where the world shrinks to the size of a single street, a single building, a single room.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets. Ten years since the day we left Riverdale, the day I cried for a  home I'd lost. My folks, they wanted better. Better schools, better streets, a life that wasn't shadowed. Stockbridge. They called it better. It wasn't Riverdale, but it was here. \n\nI made friends. I made enemies. The kind that fester in the halls of a high school. But the neighbors, they were a different story. Mr. Glen and his brood, they were kin in a way. Dennis too, for a time. Good folk. I remember their wedding.  A white dress, a ring, the air thick with the promise of forever.  And Ms. Veda, she flung a strap from her leg, a white thing, and I caught it.  Didn't catch the flowers though.  We danced, drank, and I stole a glance at Marsharii, one of their girls. Hope she's found her own kind of forever.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a labyrinth. A place where you can get lost. Even with a map now, sometimes I wander, just to see what lies around the next bend.  Kason and Curtis, they're the ones who showed me the way.  Video games, laughter, a recklessness that only youth can know.  And the park. The trees and the dirt, they quiet the noise inside.  I'll take a stick, maybe a wooden sword, and find my balance.  There's a court for tennis, a court for basketball.  I haven't picked up a racket or a ball in years, but they're there, waiting for a return. My dad, he taught me tennis, taught me the sting of a good serve. We'd sweat and curse, but it was good.\n\nThere are stories here, etched in the cracks of the pavement, whispered in the wind.  Good stories.  Bad stories.  And maybe, just maybe, the best story is still to be written.",
            "The college sits close. A stone’s throw, you might say.  The neighborhood, it sprawls mostly concrete and brick, a patchwork of aging apartments and the occasional greasy spoon. A few bars linger, cheap beer and weary laughter. One rebranded itself lately, upped the ante on prices but the whiskey still burns the same. Most folks here are students or scraping by. Kids run barefoot in the dust, their lives echoing in the playground down the street. An elementary school, a crowded hive of chatter and chalk dust. I don’t know my neighbors. A haze of smoke drifts from their door, a scent that clings to the stairwells. The building management, they tried to mask it, an air freshener a pathetic shield against the scent of indifference. Funny, in a way. A kind of insult.\n\n\nThe buildings themselves, they stand like weathered sentinels, some with fresh paint hiding rusted bones. Down the road, new towers pierce the sky, all steel and glass. The work inside was shoddy, they say, built on promises and cheap materials.  Rent’s a king’s ransom, they charge, for a place that’ll crumble at the first tremor.  A five-minute walk, there’s a diner, the kind where the food arrives on paper plates, reheated and lukewarm. Across the street, a gas station, its neon glow a beacon of weary travelers.\n\nLast summer, the city poured concrete and planted grass, a veneer of progress. The sidewalk, it stretches now, wide and clean.  But my street, it’s cloaked in trees, their branches a curtain against the world.  A few stumps mark the places where they fell, victims of progress.  Across the street, a different story: cracked sidewalks and buildings that wear their age like a shroud. 43rd Street, they call it, a place where shadows gather and secrets linger. Crime festers there, a dark bloom in the asphalt.\n\nI live on 42nd, a haven in the midst of the storm. I can afford it. The college, it’s within reach, a walk down the road. Buses rattle past, carrying me to the city’s heart. I like it here, in the quiet corners of this sprawling city.",
            "The houses stood in a loose order, a row of yellow boxes with white porches and metal roofs the color of a tired frog. Not a street, more like a bone thrown out to the wind, each house a spare rib scattered along its length. Most of them belonged to folks who knew each other, stood at the ends of their driveways in the dusk, talking low. Children, little things with scraped knees and dandelion grins, played in the dust. \n\nThe sky held a blue vastness then, clouds like feathers drifting across it. The air, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and earth, felt clean. A world away from the hum of machines and the cold glow of screens. It was a world that seemed to have forgotten time. \n\nBut the sky could turn quick as a whip. The air, heavy with a green silence, crackled with a low rumble. The sirens, a mournful wail, tore through the quiet. \n\nWe took shelter then, crouched in the dark, the air thick with the smell of rain and fear. The dog, big and bold, whined in the living room, paws scrabbling on the floor. I sat in the tub, clutching my small one, my purse, a few pillows.\n\nThe hail came down then, a thousand tiny hammers beating on the roof. The street, slick with rain, steamed in the heat. A sudden shift in the air, the sun breaking through the clouds, a double rainbow arcing across the sky. A moment of beauty in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nLife went on. The children came out, their laughter echoing in the air. The smell of supper cooking drifted from the windows.\n\nThis place, a patchwork of fields and woods, close enough to the city but far enough away, held a kind of peace. A place where roosters crowed at dawn and the night air was filled with the braying of a donkey.",
            "The dust settled on the street when I came, a boy on the cusp of eighth grade.  Making company was a hard thing then. Two boys, houses apart, became kin.  They're gone now, scattered like leaves in the wind, but the hollows they left echo still. The old faces linger, like ghosts of summers past. Two-story houses, all lined up neat, like soldiers in a parade. Kids' laughter spills out on warm days, a fleeting symphony.  Quiet most days, this place. A kind of peace settles in, a truce. You're left to yourself, unless you need a hand. Packages, delivered to the stoop, untouched. Trust, a fragile thing, blooms here.\n\nA park, a stone's throw from the porch, holds memories. Dust-covered basketballs, the thud of footballs, the crack of a bat. A boy, young and foolish,  knocked to the ground, nose brimming with blood. But the good memories, they outweigh the bad. Now, the park is a place for quiet moments with the younger ones, cousins with eyes wide with wonder, clinging to swings and slides. A bittersweet ache, watching them play.\n\nThe air here smells of spices.  Chinese takeout, the tang of Indian curry, the sizzle of Mexican street food, the rich aroma of Italian sauce, all within a stone's throw. Yet, the younger folk, they scroll through their screens, summoning food from afar.  Fast food, a siren's call, echoes on every corner. Pizza, a universal language, spoken everywhere.  Stores, like a temple of plenty, offer everything a soul might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco, a behemoth of groceries. Even a small Indian shop, tucked away, offering a taste of home.\n\nI am a son of this place, born of its streets and sidewalks. In the world outside, stories of darkness and despair seep through the cracks.  Here, in this quiet corner, I find solace.  A haven.",
            "The town of Johnston.  Just another speck on the map of South Carolina.  But peaches. They're what they live for, what they breathe.  The sign at the edge of town proclaims it: \"Peach Capital of the World.\" A claim they hold dear.  Land stretched out flat and brown, mostly peach trees or cattle.  Houses, two stories high, set back from the road, metal roofs glinting in the southern sun, or draped in gray shingles weathered by years of heat.  Fields in front, for the animals, for the crops.  \n\nThere's a single stoplight in town, a yellow eye blinking at a crossroads.  That's where you'll find what passes for commerce: a Chinese place called Hong Kong, a couple of booths at Fiesta, Gary's burgers.  A pizza place used to be there, but that's gone now, like the summer rain.  Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small place where they mix Cherry Coke like it's some kind of sacrament.  And the IGA, a grocery store with prices to match its name. Folks like to drive to Batesburg-Leesville for their shopping, though.  Walmart.  That's where the real deal is.  Dollar General, that's the heart of Johnston.  Always packed.  Things, that's what it sells: things you need, things you don't.\n\nThere's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a kind woman.  She's been there since before most folks could remember.  They even deliver.  Next door, a place for dogs, Clark's Cuts and Kennels.  They'll take care of your hound, feed it, clean it, make it shiny.  The doctor's office and the vet, they're out on the edge of town, small but reliable.  And there's the school, Johnston Elementary.  Fifth grade, and they're shipped off to the next town.  No parks in Johnston.  They're building one, a patch of green in a sea of brown.  \n\nNot much to do in Johnston, not for the young or restless.  Just a quiet place, you blink, and you miss it.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place, it was on some tinny radio show, voices whisperin' about folks gone missing.  Strange, that. Every damned apartment in the sector was goin' for a king's ransom, a thousand a month easy.  Never heard a word of it, neither had any of my kin. Maybe it's the struggle.  Know a few boys, they weep themselves to sleep at night. Things ain't cheap, no sir. But we've learned to make do, over the years.  You come to like the dust of flea market toys, the scent of mothballed clothes.  You smell a lot less in these later years.  Might take to the smoke, or maybe it's just the way things are. But the flea market, it clings. The smell of grown life, it's dusty magazines stacked on a piano with its lid closed.  It burrows into the leather, stays there even after you scrub it raw. Here, three thrift stores within a man's walk. Start on the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a place for dusty books, and a shop for curiosities. Downtown, it's thick, cars and people chokin' the streets come mornin', but inside the shops, it's a tomb. No matter how many souls pass by, the store holds its silence. A good place to lose an hour or two. Every year, more and more of them come. Cars and folks flood in.  A growin' city they say.  Headquarters for one of them internet empires, deliverin' everything under the sun. Still got growing pains though. Reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own path, ain't askin' much of you. You can be alone, quiet, keep to yourself, and they'll leave you be.  Not like down South, where a little concern means you care. Here, they don't pry. You can keep your shell on, as long as you please, and the city'll crash and roll back like the tide. A lively place, it is. Between the piano player next door and the two singers upstairs, there's always somethin' goin' on.  We ain't so much a house of strangers, more like a community of friends. Gather for need, celebrate birthdays, mourn the dead, help each other out when we can.  Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of the folks around me, they're good people, treat me right. Try to keep my space clean, leave them food now and again, and they do the same.  Bring in the mail for them, they bring mine.  It's good to see 'em, and I think they like my company as much as I like theirs.  Live in this big, cold, concrete sprawl, but it's folks like them that make me feel like I ain't done ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home sits on the edge of things. A suburb they call it, though it's more like a sprawl of uniformity, all neat lawns and matching houses. The air itself smells of fresh-cut grass and the faint tang of chlorine from the community pool.  A homeowner's association, they say, keeps things this way. Every house a cookie cutter, every yard a template. \n\nTwo-car garages line the streets, paved smooth like a racetrack. The driveways are short, the trees stunted, their branches reaching out like pleading fingers. There are no mailboxes, not the kind you see dotting the lawns of other places. Instead, they've corralled them all together, a cluster of metal boxes at the end of the street, each one keyed and guarded. \n\nThe houses, mostly one story, stand in neat rows, their roofs tilted towards the sun. There's a handful of two-story ones, like sentinels keeping watch over the rest.  A few miles out, the city bleeds into the farmland, a concrete river snaking its way through fields of corn and wheat. It's a place where retirees gather, their days measured out in walks and pool laps. Here and there, a young family, a couple with a dog, a flicker of something else amidst the stillness.\n\nThe city itself is large, but feels small, a place where you can walk down the street and know most of the faces. A single mall, not grand, but functional, sits at its heart, a beacon of consumerism. Drive fifteen minutes in any direction and you'll find a chain store, a familiar logo promising a taste of something else, something beyond the borders of this predictable place.",
            "The town sits low, a rust stain on the map just beyond the city's sprawling maw.  My corner of it, east side, wears the mark of hard times.  Houses lean tired, patched up, held together by hope and cheap paint.   Folks here, they're mostly salt of the earth, eyes that have seen too much sun and too little rain. A nod, a grunt, maybe a word or two when you pass. Crime ain't a stranger, though. A few years back, a boy from down the street, barely a man, got caught in some bad luck outside a bar.  Heard the shots, a hollow echo in the night.  Still, we lock our doors, keep our heads down, and hope for the best. The whole county's been choked by that dust cloud, the one they call the \"opioid epidemic.\"  Taken too many down, leaving empty chairs and broken dreams in its wake.  There's help, they say, places to mend the shattered soul, pills to fight the demons. But the scars stay.  \n\nMy son, he goes to the schoolhouse. Decent folks there, tryin' to build something good in a hard place.  He's got his own troubles, but they treat him kind. The schoolyard's a haven, a patch of green in a world gone gray.  See them folks gatherin' for bake sales, car washes, all to keep a roof over their heads and books in their hands.  Don't matter if your pockets are light, everyone's welcome at their table.  They even feed the kids, make sure no belly goes empty.  \n\nThe town itself, it's a patchwork of faded glory and stubborn hope.  The city fathers, they've spent their money fixin' up the streets downtown, where the shops and the crowds are.  But out here, on the east side, we're left to our own devices.  The streets are cracked, the houses creak, and the wind whispers stories of better days.  Still, there's a quiet strength here, a resilience born of hardship.  We make do, we hold on, and we dream of a tomorrow that might just be a little brighter.",
            "The city sets on a hill, a jumble of bricks and mortar, some of it breatheless with age.  My own place is a seven-story concrete hulk across from the old theater, a ghost of what it once was. Down a block, past the boarded windows and cracked sidewalks, is a bar, a refuge for the lost and the weary. In summer, the heat hangs thick and the line spills out onto the street, a tangle of bodies seeking solace in cheap beer and worn vinyl.  \n\nThree blocks up, the park. A patch of green in a sea of grey, enclosed by a wall of poured concrete, the steps leading up like the teeth of some forgotten beast. Winter comes hard, draining the life out of the city.  The wind bites, the rain falls in sheets, and the homeless make their home in the shadows, huddled close for warmth. Tents strung along the sidewalk, a chain of desperation against the cold. The city center, they say, is safer than the wilds. Closer to the soup kitchen, the place where they can wash the grime away. \n\nBut there's a beauty in this place, a raw, unflinching beauty. It ain't the buildings, though they stand proud, scarred by time and neglect. It's the people. Hilltop. Once a den of vipers, a place where the air itself tasted of violence. The government came sweeping in, DEA agents and their badge-bright smiles, trying to scrub clean the stain of sin. But the stories linger, passed down like whispered curses, a reminder of what was. The people here, they remember. They fight, tooth and nail, to keep the shadows at bay.\n\nThere are warnings, whispers about keeping to the light, about the dangers that lurk after dark.  They say a white girl shouldn't be out alone.  Maybe it's true. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's just a phantom of the past, a ghost story told to keep the fear alive. I walk these streets, heart pounding, eyes open, and I see kindness in the faces I meet. I see a hand offered, a jacket shared, a moment of connection in the cold embrace of the city.  Here, on the Hilltop, I feel alive.",
            "The land here stretches flat, a patchwork of fields yielding to towns stitched together by dusty roads.  No concrete canyons, no glittering glass and steel, just the slow churn of life under a vast sky. No franchise names to mark the way, no neon signs to pierce the quiet dusk. You drive for what you need, for everything. But the world opens up here, the water a constant presence. Lake Michigan, a grey-blue expanse stretching to the horizon, and Lake Charlevoix, a jewel of emerald green nestled close by.  Beaches, shallow and sandy, whisper at your feet.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's a tapestry woven with the threads of generations. Houses stand shoulder to shoulder, not in some regimented row but in a rambling dance of cedar shake and brick. Some bear the scars of time, their paint faded, their bones creaking, while others have been reborn, their faces scrubbed clean, their interiors gleaming. Most have basements, deep and dark, their concrete mouths yawning open to the road. Aluminum siding, the color of old pennies, glints in the sun. A riot of color splashes across the blocks, a testament to individuality in a land where sameness often reigns.\n\nYards, they're not just patches of green but extensions of home, filled with the laughter of children and the scent of freshly cut grass. Trampolines bounce, swings sway, and playsets creak with the weight of dreams. Gardens bloom, bursting forth with life, and fences hold the restless energy of dogs and chickens.\n\nThese are the people of the heartland, hardworking and weathered. They raise their families, tend their gardens, and watch their children run barefoot in the streets. The air hums with the rhythm of their lives: the clatter of evening dishes, the murmur of conversations on porches, the distant rumble of an engine plane taking flight.\n\nIt's not a place that shouts its beauty, but whispers it in the rustling leaves, the warmth of a neighbor's smile, the safe embrace of familiarity. It's a place where you can feel the pulse of the earth, the steady beat of a life lived close to the land. Here, at the edge of the world, you find something precious: a sense of belonging, a place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city was a sprawl, a jumble of brick and glass reaching for the sky. Concrete canyons choked with traffic, the air thick with the fumes of a thousand engines. Businesses, like weeds, pushed up between the buildings: offices with their sterile lights, stores with windows that promised solace, restaurants humming with a discordant symphony of clatter and chatter. You could find anything here, anything at all. From the glittering chrome of the chain stores to the dusty shelves of the little shops tucked away in forgotten corners. \n\nThere were parks, pockets of green in the grey, where mothers pushed strollers and children shrieked with laughter. But even there, the city clung, the shadows of the buildings stretching like grasping fingers. The people were a tapestry woven from a thousand threads, a kaleidoscope of faces and tongues. A whisper of Yiddish in the air, the lilting cadence of Russian, the vibrant energy of the Korean market just beyond the edge of sight. They lived in this city, these strangers, each in their own world, their own story. \n\nIt was a city of contradictions: a place where the latest gadget was sold alongside the worn-out dreams of the forgotten. Where the pulse of progress throbbed alongside the echoes of ancient stories. Houses, like forgotten sentinels, stood shoulder to shoulder, each a silent witness to the passing years. Some, grand and imposing, spoke of a bygone era. Others, small and humble, cradled families bathed in the fading light of the setting sun.  The city never slept, never yielded, a beast that swallowed you whole and spat you out again, a little bit changed, a little bit more weary.",
            "The houses here stand close, most of them single family. But some, they've been split, two lives under one roof, though still joined at the hip. My place, it's got a patch of dirt out front, a driveway to the left. Like the others, it whispers of a time when the suburbs were the promise, the American dream. A dream that held folks close once, but now it's pulling back, a tide receding. Still, these houses stand, a testament to a dream that ain't quite dead. They beckon, like ghosts on a windless night, to anyone who passes through.\n\nThe folks ain't as bright-eyed as they used to be. Yards ain't kept like they were. But there's still cars in the driveways, kids playing in the streets as if the world was a closed fist around their hand. The school's been standing ninety years, a monument to yesterday. It conjures something in the young, a flicker of hope. In the old, it stirs memories, ghosts of a time gone by. Churches, they're few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts, they're always full.\n\nHouses all different, but they feel the same. A supermarket, they call it Super \"A\", owned by a Yemeni family. The only Arabs in these parts, maybe. The rest, they're mostly Black. Streets are wide, kids play football, stopping only for the cars. Most folks here, they've been here since their grandparents were kids. They got stories, tales of a time when everyone knew everyone. There used to be a karate school, but Hollywood stopped makin' those movies, and the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, filled with pills that promise to fix everything.\n\nThere's an old movie theater, showing films from a bygone era. The young folks, they scoff, but the old folks, they go, a cheap night out, away from the young'uns. The expressway, it cuts through the next town over. We tried to get an exit, the young folks wanted it, but the old folks said it would ruin the town. They convinced the council, and now we're left with this road, a scar across the landscape. They're building a new high school, trying to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg, with a country accent and a log cabin, that'd be the perfect symbol for this place.",
            "You might pass it by,  a shadow in the sun. Behind the strip, the tired storefronts, a place you wouldn't look twice. Not a place for livin', not the kind folks want. But cut through the weeds behind the bones of that old Whole Foods, past the hotels that sleep most of the year, waiting for dust to settle on their halls, and you'll find a world tucked away.  Rows of apartments, close as Russian dolls laid bare, pieces set side by side. The first ones you see, they've seen their share of trouble, the kind that bleeds onto the news. We won't linger there. Appearances, they can be a thin veil. But past those, there’s a quiet hum, a world unseen by most.  \n\nAcross the street, a college campus, a sprawl of brick and faded paint. Students shuffle in with coffee cups, eyes heavy as dawn. The gates creak, one by one, letting them in. Commuters curse, fists clenched, their windows steamed with impatience. The road forks, and a park unfolds, green and sharp under the summer sun. A rehab center sits beside it, a porch swing creaking, a ceiling fan stirring the thick air. Children spin and whirl in the grass, their laughter echoing. Old folks walk their dogs, eyes narrowed at the teenagers on their boards, a silent exchange of glances.  \n\nA strip mall leans against the park, a row of storefronts promising everything and nothing. Sushi, cheap and quick, a swimming pool supply store, a nail salon where promises of beauty are made and broken. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, eat hibachi chicken, all in a single afternoon. The frozen yogurt place, the kind where you build your own sundae, is always buzzing with those kids, their faces flushed, their cups dripping with pink and blue. They spin and preen, trying to be something more than who they are. \n\nThis is a slice of nowhere, a place where time slows and the air hangs heavy. A familiar scene, a story told a thousand times before.",
            "\"Where the hell is everything?\" she asked, the car rumbling past fields of corn that stretched to the horizon. \"This is it,\" I told her, knowing the sight would strike a chill in her bones. She'd come from a town where the grocery store was a stone's throw from her front door. Never seen so much empty sky, never felt the ache of its vastness. \n\nShe looked out at the endless rows, and I told her about growing up in Ohio, about the dirt under your fingernails and the wind whispering through the fields. In that moment, maybe she finally began to see me, the boy from the dust.\n\nKeep going down this two-lane blacktop, past the quarry choked with water, and you'll find the place. A scattering of houses, mostly brick and stucco, each with a half-acre patch of ground they guarded like their own kingdoms. Spring brings a riot of color, flowers bursting from the earth, and the trees, they change with the seasons, a slow, steady pulse of green to gold to bare limbs. In the driveways, Mercedes gleam, fat and sleek as predators, their chrome reflecting the brutal sun after a good, hard wash.\n\nMy neighbor, a Korean man, he's always out there, tending his lawn. A John Deere whirs, a lonely song against the silence, and his voice rises above it, singing some forgotten tune. They all laugh at him, call him crazy, but he's got a heart as big as his lawn. He used to be a doctor, you know, back in another life. Now he blends in with the grass, a ghost in a green suit.\n\nKeep going, past his yard, past the geese honking in the side yard, past the stream that trickles into the quarry, past the bullfrogs and the distant moo of cattle. There's a bridge, made of rough-hewn wood, leading to a place untouched, wild. Trees, herbs, wildflowers, a tangle of green. That's where I spent my days, building forts and chasing rabbits, making friends with the boys who lived nearby. \n\nWinter comes hard here, a bitter wind that bites at your bones. The green turns to brown, the trees bare skeletons against the sky. Snow falls sometimes, a white silence that blankets the world. My sister and I, we fought like wolves, snowballs our weapons. We built snow forts, igloos of ice and dreams, barricades against the cold. In the white silence, we were kings and queens of our own nowhere land.",
            "You come to Portland, Oregon, and you gotta understand somethin' 'bout the word \"weird.\" It's etched on a building, a place that serves you pizza one minute, whiskey the next, and maybe a song or somethin' unholy after that. It's a motto, see? \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some say it's a whisper, a remembrance of a time when this city was just a shadow, cheaper, less-known. Back when the weird was born, bred in the shadows of the 90s, the early 2000s. To others, it's a siren song, a call to come and be weird, to be embraced in your strangeness. \n\nBut the Californians, they're comin', cash in hand, buildin' their condos, changin' the face of this town. And still, the weird lingers. It ain't about acceptance, not always. It's about acceptin' the things that make your skin crawl, the things that ain't supposed to be. We got our Walmarts, our Target aisles, buyin' our trinkets from the far side of the world, just like the rest.\n\nWeird ain't a monolith, see? It's a million shades, a million ways to be not. Portland's got its yoga mats, its hipsters and suits. Maybe it's just that we take it all less serious, here. Houses painted in colors you wouldn't believe, gardens bursting with life, boxes left on the curb, filled with the castoffs of others. Sometimes magic, see? A shirt, a book, a dusty record player. A whisper of the past, a second chance.\n\nThat's Portland to me. But I'm just one shade of weird in a city full of them. Some folks wouldn't touch a box on the sidewalk, no how. They're off doin' goat yoga, or cheerin' on the Timbers. This city's got a heart filled with dreams, with aspirations, with the ghosts of dreams gone by. We got our demons, too. The drugs, the homeless, the rain that hangs heavy in the air. We're not so different from anywhere else, really. Just a shade weirder, maybe.",
            "The mountains. They were always there. Northward. Watching the sun bleed across the sky each day, each dusk. I could turn my back on them, bury myself in work, in the clamor of life, but they'd still be there. Unmoved. Uncaring. Stubbornly standing against the wind. And when the world pressed down, when the worry coiled tight in my chest, they'd call to me. I'd turn, and in their silence, I'd find some measure of peace. Enough to keep going. One day at a time.\n\nI came here for school, a boy fresh off the bus. The mountains north of campus, they were the first thing that grabbed me. The university, it had its own kind of beauty, the buildings, the ponds, the trees. But it was the mountains, they held the throne. The town itself, it had its own rhythm. Cafés that smelled of burnt coffee and late nights. The downtown, a maze of faded brick, whispers of history in the worn paint. A pulse, a lifeblood, that throbbed close to the city's heart. But step past the library, and the quiet would settle back in. A duality, all in close quarters. It made the place breathe, felt like a secret waiting to be unveiled. Memories, they piled up, each one tied to a corner of the town. Laughter in the park after all-nighters, the rush of legs on the pavement, dodging faces, to catch a movie. But there were dark memories too, as in any place. The ponds, they were good for thinking. For crying, sometimes, at 2 AM, when the questions ate at you. I'd watch the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each with their own purpose, and my own would feel like a thin wisp of smoke. So I walked. Past the pond, past the houses, past the quiet streets. And I found myself walking north. The sun was rising, painting the sky with fire, and there they were. The mountains. Solid, unwavering. They stood against the painted sky, and in their immensity, I found a strength I didn't know I had.",
            "The city calls it Bensonhurst. Brooklyn's flesh, sprawling and dense. You'll find your way. The A train runs through it like a rusted vein. The air is thick with the scent of spices, the clatter of carts, and the murmur of a hundred tongues.  It's a neighborhood built on the backs of immigrants, their lives stitched together with the thread of survival. \n\nEvery block, a testament to their arrival. Asian faces in shop windows, the glint of neon signs promising cheap eats and quick washes. Supermarkets overflowing with unfamiliar fruits and vegetables, their shelves stacked high with promise. They say the food is good, the prices even better. A neighborhood built on hard work and the dream of a better life.\n\nBut it's not all sameness. The streets are a tapestry, woven with threads of every hue. The old and the new, the worn and the bright.  A park nearby, a concrete island of green, where children shriek with laughter and the echo of basketballs mingles with the rumble of distant traffic.  \n\nHouses stand shoulder to shoulder, two-family dwellings, a testament to the endless cycle of life and loss.  The air hums with noise: cars groaning their way through the narrow streets, the bass drum beat of a passing car stereo. At night, shadows lengthen and secrets gather.  You hear whispers of trouble, stories of broken trust and shattered dreams. Be careful. \n\nThe city's filth stains even its most hopeful corners. Dog waste like landmines, scattered on sidewalks and stairwells. A reminder that even in the heart of the city, nature's decay finds a way.",
            "The sidewalks ceased long ago. The land here runs downward, a greasy slope toward the sea. The house sits high, perched on the crest of it, what the runners call the \"workout hill.\" The road, given over to those who walk, is pocked and scarred, a danger to the unwary. Wires hang frayed and tattered overhead, struck and mended by the storms that come often, like ill-tempered gods. The evergreens stand sentinel, but their shade is a curse, a blot on the view of the water. They've tried to cut them down, these folks, to see the sea. Houses rise up, glass-eyed and hungry, reaching for the horizon.  At dusk, the water catches fire, the sky bleeds orange, a fleeting beauty. But the clouds, they gather quick, shrouding the sun in a damp, pale haze. Moss, like a living thing, crawls on everything, a green velvet clinging to roof and car and railing. Once, a month passed, my car left to sleep in the drive, and when I returned it was a tapestry of green, a mossy tomb. Took hours to scrub it clean. \n\nChildren are scarce. The school, a few blocks down, stands empty most days. Old folks mostly, these folks, retired to the hills. Dogs are their solace, their companions. They roam the lawns, chase each other down the road, and slip through open doors like ghosts. One, a lean mutt, wandered into my living room, startled by the silence. Had to coax it back out, a hesitant retreat. Rabbits, fat and bold, burrow in the earth, their work a nuisance to the gardeners. But the cats, they take pleasure in the chase, their eyes gleaming with the thrill of the hunt.\n\nBirds flit amongst the trees, sparrows and hummingbirds, occasional hawks or eagles, chased away by the raucous crows. No shops here, just the sea air and the scent of salt. There are a few places by the water, restaurants with tables overlooking the bay. The beach is a narrow sliver of sand, but the rocks, they hold a certain allure, each one a missile hurled into the water. The bay itself, a narrow arm of the sea, opens up to the horizon, the opposite shore a faint smudge even in the mist.",
            "The house sits at the corner, a sentinel on the asphalt ribbon that stitched two black ribbons of highway together.  The traffic hummed through, a constant murmur against the silence of the day.  A quiet place it was, mostly. Folks went about their business, tending to yards and chores, the rhythm of their lives a slow, familiar song.  In winter, the children would carve down the hill on their sleds, tiny figures against the slate sky. We saw them all come and go, the rusted hulks of their vehicles as familiar as the faces themselves.  A stranger's car would draw a look, a fleeting curiosity in the unchanging landscape.  Some walked, dogs leashed by their sides, others pedaled on bikes, the children's laughter echoing in the stillness.  We were homebound, our work tethered to the walls. Four souls in all: myself, my wife, and two daughters, eleven and fourteen, their lives unfolding in the quiet space between the trees.  They knew us, these neighbors, our comings and goings as predictable as the sunrise. We played in the yard, rain or shine, the scent of wood smoke and grilled meat rising from the back deck on balmy evenings. The air throbbed with the drone of lawnmowers from March to October, a persistent reminder of the season's relentless march.  Trees, ancient sentinels, stood guard over the neighborhood, their leaves a fiery tapestry in the fall.  Burning, they released a sharp tang of smoke into the air, a signal that the year was turning.  Lately, winter seemed a forgotten memory, the days stretching into a long, languid autumn. The garage, at the back of the house, became our sanctuary, a refuge from the world.  We rarely used the front door.  I'd work on my truck, tinkering with gears and metal, the garage doors open, my senses tuned to the neighborhood's hum. Holidays brought a flicker of life to the quiet streets, families gathering, cars crowding the asphalt.  A brief burst of noise, then the silence would return, unbroken and profound.  It wasn't perfect, this life, but it was ours. If only the traffic would quiet, it would be complete.",
            "The neighborhood sits sunk in the high desert. Dust. Dust everywhere. Brown stretches to the horizon. A lawn here, a patch of green, and you know that man's spilling his coin to keep it so. Back in the 90s, the houses were scattered. Now they creep closer, a slow tide of stucco and concrete. It's becoming a city, this place. Like all cities, I reckon. Most folks are alright, friendly enough. But there's good and bad in every hole. Here it's mostly old folks, the kind with a slow smile and a story in their eyes. There are stores, the chains that snake their way across the land: Food 4 Less, Smart & Final. But for anything upscale, you gotta drive. Whole Foods, that kind of thing, ain't found here. \n\nJobs? Construction, mostly. This town's still hungry, still building. Sprawl stretching out like a fever dream. Scares me a little, that growth. I left a city once, and I ain't looking to go back. \n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and T-bar, the bones of these new buildings. \n\nThe desert, though, that's the thing. It calls to you. The stark beauty, the silence that presses in. It's a hard land, unforgiving. But it's home to creatures you won't find anywhere else. Lizards skittering on the hot sand, beetles the size of your fist. My kids, they're obsessed with them. Always chasing after something new, something strange. \n\nThere's a fair every year, a dust cloud of music and laughter. And up in Wrightwood, the mountains stand proud, covered in snow. You can find peace there, or a thrill on the slopes. \n\nAnd there's the museum, quiet and dusty, filled with the bones of the past. A story told in stone and bone, a reminder that this land has seen a lot, and it's still here.",
            "They ask about the neighborhood.  And  sure, others will speak of yards and picket fences, of lawns and driveways. But mine is a different kind of place. My neighborhood is the brick and mortar of the college. The walls that hold the souls of a hundred voices, a hundred stories. My community, they are the faces I see in the hallways, the ones who share the thin walls and the echoing silence of late nights. \n\nThere are houses here, yes, but not the kind you might imagine. Apartments stacked like iron lungs, each floor a universe unto itself. Two, sometimes four, souls sharing thin spaces. Then there are the houses,  older, weathered, where the ghosts of alumni linger. And the dorms, colossal structures holding a hundred dreams within their hollowed halls. \n\nPeople, they come and go like the seasons.  A kaleidoscope of faces, young and old, from lands far and wide. The professors, the custodians, the students, all bound together by the rhythm of the campus. They are the lifeblood of this place, their laughter and their sorrow echoing through the corridors.\n\nAnd there are stores, yes, selling cheap coffee and textbooks, echoes of the outside world. And a park, a small oasis of green amidst the concrete, where they gather to talk and to dream.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, a place where the world shrinks to the size of a single street, a single building, a single room.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets. Ten years since the day we left Riverdale, the day I cried for a  home I'd lost. My folks, they wanted better. Better schools, better streets, a life that wasn't shadowed. Stockbridge. They called it better. It wasn't Riverdale, but it was here. \n\nI made friends. I made enemies. The kind that fester in the halls of a high school. But the neighbors, they were a different story. Mr. Glen and his brood, they were kin in a way. Dennis too, for a time. Good folk. I remember their wedding.  A white dress, a ring, the air thick with the promise of forever.  And Ms. Veda, she flung a strap from her leg, a white thing, and I caught it.  Didn't catch the flowers though.  We danced, drank, and I stole a glance at Marsharii, one of their girls. Hope she's found her own kind of forever.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a labyrinth. A place where you can get lost. Even with a map now, sometimes I wander, just to see what lies around the next bend.  Kason and Curtis, they're the ones who showed me the way.  Video games, laughter, a recklessness that only youth can know.  And the park. The trees and the dirt, they quiet the noise inside.  I'll take a stick, maybe a wooden sword, and find my balance.  There's a court for tennis, a court for basketball.  I haven't picked up a racket or a ball in years, but they're there, waiting for a return. My dad, he taught me tennis, taught me the sting of a good serve. We'd sweat and curse, but it was good.\n\nThere are stories here, etched in the cracks of the pavement, whispered in the wind.  Good stories.  Bad stories.  And maybe, just maybe, the best story is still to be written.",
            "The college sits close. A stone’s throw, you might say.  The neighborhood, it sprawls mostly concrete and brick, a patchwork of aging apartments and the occasional greasy spoon. A few bars linger, cheap beer and weary laughter. One rebranded itself lately, upped the ante on prices but the whiskey still burns the same. Most folks here are students or scraping by. Kids run barefoot in the dust, their lives echoing in the playground down the street. An elementary school, a crowded hive of chatter and chalk dust. I don’t know my neighbors. A haze of smoke drifts from their door, a scent that clings to the stairwells. The building management, they tried to mask it, an air freshener a pathetic shield against the scent of indifference. Funny, in a way. A kind of insult.\n\n\nThe buildings themselves, they stand like weathered sentinels, some with fresh paint hiding rusted bones. Down the road, new towers pierce the sky, all steel and glass. The work inside was shoddy, they say, built on promises and cheap materials.  Rent’s a king’s ransom, they charge, for a place that’ll crumble at the first tremor.  A five-minute walk, there’s a diner, the kind where the food arrives on paper plates, reheated and lukewarm. Across the street, a gas station, its neon glow a beacon of weary travelers.\n\nLast summer, the city poured concrete and planted grass, a veneer of progress. The sidewalk, it stretches now, wide and clean.  But my street, it’s cloaked in trees, their branches a curtain against the world.  A few stumps mark the places where they fell, victims of progress.  Across the street, a different story: cracked sidewalks and buildings that wear their age like a shroud. 43rd Street, they call it, a place where shadows gather and secrets linger. Crime festers there, a dark bloom in the asphalt.\n\nI live on 42nd, a haven in the midst of the storm. I can afford it. The college, it’s within reach, a walk down the road. Buses rattle past, carrying me to the city’s heart. I like it here, in the quiet corners of this sprawling city.",
            "The houses stood in a loose order, a row of yellow boxes with white porches and metal roofs the color of a tired frog. Not a street, more like a bone thrown out to the wind, each house a spare rib scattered along its length. Most of them belonged to folks who knew each other, stood at the ends of their driveways in the dusk, talking low. Children, little things with scraped knees and dandelion grins, played in the dust. \n\nThe sky held a blue vastness then, clouds like feathers drifting across it. The air, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and earth, felt clean. A world away from the hum of machines and the cold glow of screens. It was a world that seemed to have forgotten time. \n\nBut the sky could turn quick as a whip. The air, heavy with a green silence, crackled with a low rumble. The sirens, a mournful wail, tore through the quiet. \n\nWe took shelter then, crouched in the dark, the air thick with the smell of rain and fear. The dog, big and bold, whined in the living room, paws scrabbling on the floor. I sat in the tub, clutching my small one, my purse, a few pillows.\n\nThe hail came down then, a thousand tiny hammers beating on the roof. The street, slick with rain, steamed in the heat. A sudden shift in the air, the sun breaking through the clouds, a double rainbow arcing across the sky. A moment of beauty in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nLife went on. The children came out, their laughter echoing in the air. The smell of supper cooking drifted from the windows.\n\nThis place, a patchwork of fields and woods, close enough to the city but far enough away, held a kind of peace. A place where roosters crowed at dawn and the night air was filled with the braying of a donkey.",
            "The dust settled on the street when I came, a boy on the cusp of eighth grade.  Making company was a hard thing then. Two boys, houses apart, became kin.  They're gone now, scattered like leaves in the wind, but the hollows they left echo still. The old faces linger, like ghosts of summers past. Two-story houses, all lined up neat, like soldiers in a parade. Kids' laughter spills out on warm days, a fleeting symphony.  Quiet most days, this place. A kind of peace settles in, a truce. You're left to yourself, unless you need a hand. Packages, delivered to the stoop, untouched. Trust, a fragile thing, blooms here.\n\nA park, a stone's throw from the porch, holds memories. Dust-covered basketballs, the thud of footballs, the crack of a bat. A boy, young and foolish,  knocked to the ground, nose brimming with blood. But the good memories, they outweigh the bad. Now, the park is a place for quiet moments with the younger ones, cousins with eyes wide with wonder, clinging to swings and slides. A bittersweet ache, watching them play.\n\nThe air here smells of spices.  Chinese takeout, the tang of Indian curry, the sizzle of Mexican street food, the rich aroma of Italian sauce, all within a stone's throw. Yet, the younger folk, they scroll through their screens, summoning food from afar.  Fast food, a siren's call, echoes on every corner. Pizza, a universal language, spoken everywhere.  Stores, like a temple of plenty, offer everything a soul might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco, a behemoth of groceries. Even a small Indian shop, tucked away, offering a taste of home.\n\nI am a son of this place, born of its streets and sidewalks. In the world outside, stories of darkness and despair seep through the cracks.  Here, in this quiet corner, I find solace.  A haven.",
            "The town of Johnston.  Just another speck on the map of South Carolina.  But peaches. They're what they live for, what they breathe.  The sign at the edge of town proclaims it: \"Peach Capital of the World.\" A claim they hold dear.  Land stretched out flat and brown, mostly peach trees or cattle.  Houses, two stories high, set back from the road, metal roofs glinting in the southern sun, or draped in gray shingles weathered by years of heat.  Fields in front, for the animals, for the crops.  \n\nThere's a single stoplight in town, a yellow eye blinking at a crossroads.  That's where you'll find what passes for commerce: a Chinese place called Hong Kong, a couple of booths at Fiesta, Gary's burgers.  A pizza place used to be there, but that's gone now, like the summer rain.  Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small place where they mix Cherry Coke like it's some kind of sacrament.  And the IGA, a grocery store with prices to match its name. Folks like to drive to Batesburg-Leesville for their shopping, though.  Walmart.  That's where the real deal is.  Dollar General, that's the heart of Johnston.  Always packed.  Things, that's what it sells: things you need, things you don't.\n\nThere's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a kind woman.  She's been there since before most folks could remember.  They even deliver.  Next door, a place for dogs, Clark's Cuts and Kennels.  They'll take care of your hound, feed it, clean it, make it shiny.  The doctor's office and the vet, they're out on the edge of town, small but reliable.  And there's the school, Johnston Elementary.  Fifth grade, and they're shipped off to the next town.  No parks in Johnston.  They're building one, a patch of green in a sea of brown.  \n\nNot much to do in Johnston, not for the young or restless.  Just a quiet place, you blink, and you miss it.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place, it was on some tinny radio show, voices whisperin' about folks gone missing.  Strange, that. Every damned apartment in the sector was goin' for a king's ransom, a thousand a month easy.  Never heard a word of it, neither had any of my kin. Maybe it's the struggle.  Know a few boys, they weep themselves to sleep at night. Things ain't cheap, no sir. But we've learned to make do, over the years.  You come to like the dust of flea market toys, the scent of mothballed clothes.  You smell a lot less in these later years.  Might take to the smoke, or maybe it's just the way things are. But the flea market, it clings. The smell of grown life, it's dusty magazines stacked on a piano with its lid closed.  It burrows into the leather, stays there even after you scrub it raw. Here, three thrift stores within a man's walk. Start on the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a place for dusty books, and a shop for curiosities. Downtown, it's thick, cars and people chokin' the streets come mornin', but inside the shops, it's a tomb. No matter how many souls pass by, the store holds its silence. A good place to lose an hour or two. Every year, more and more of them come. Cars and folks flood in.  A growin' city they say.  Headquarters for one of them internet empires, deliverin' everything under the sun. Still got growing pains though. Reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own path, ain't askin' much of you. You can be alone, quiet, keep to yourself, and they'll leave you be.  Not like down South, where a little concern means you care. Here, they don't pry. You can keep your shell on, as long as you please, and the city'll crash and roll back like the tide. A lively place, it is. Between the piano player next door and the two singers upstairs, there's always somethin' goin' on.  We ain't so much a house of strangers, more like a community of friends. Gather for need, celebrate birthdays, mourn the dead, help each other out when we can.  Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of the folks around me, they're good people, treat me right. Try to keep my space clean, leave them food now and again, and they do the same.  Bring in the mail for them, they bring mine.  It's good to see 'em, and I think they like my company as much as I like theirs.  Live in this big, cold, concrete sprawl, but it's folks like them that make me feel like I ain't done ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home sits on the edge of things. A suburb they call it, though it's more like a sprawl of uniformity, all neat lawns and matching houses. The air itself smells of fresh-cut grass and the faint tang of chlorine from the community pool.  A homeowner's association, they say, keeps things this way. Every house a cookie cutter, every yard a template. \n\nTwo-car garages line the streets, paved smooth like a racetrack. The driveways are short, the trees stunted, their branches reaching out like pleading fingers. There are no mailboxes, not the kind you see dotting the lawns of other places. Instead, they've corralled them all together, a cluster of metal boxes at the end of the street, each one keyed and guarded. \n\nThe houses, mostly one story, stand in neat rows, their roofs tilted towards the sun. There's a handful of two-story ones, like sentinels keeping watch over the rest.  A few miles out, the city bleeds into the farmland, a concrete river snaking its way through fields of corn and wheat. It's a place where retirees gather, their days measured out in walks and pool laps. Here and there, a young family, a couple with a dog, a flicker of something else amidst the stillness.\n\nThe city itself is large, but feels small, a place where you can walk down the street and know most of the faces. A single mall, not grand, but functional, sits at its heart, a beacon of consumerism. Drive fifteen minutes in any direction and you'll find a chain store, a familiar logo promising a taste of something else, something beyond the borders of this predictable place.",
            "The town sits low, a rust stain on the map just beyond the city's sprawling maw.  My corner of it, east side, wears the mark of hard times.  Houses lean tired, patched up, held together by hope and cheap paint.   Folks here, they're mostly salt of the earth, eyes that have seen too much sun and too little rain. A nod, a grunt, maybe a word or two when you pass. Crime ain't a stranger, though. A few years back, a boy from down the street, barely a man, got caught in some bad luck outside a bar.  Heard the shots, a hollow echo in the night.  Still, we lock our doors, keep our heads down, and hope for the best. The whole county's been choked by that dust cloud, the one they call the \"opioid epidemic.\"  Taken too many down, leaving empty chairs and broken dreams in its wake.  There's help, they say, places to mend the shattered soul, pills to fight the demons. But the scars stay.  \n\nMy son, he goes to the schoolhouse. Decent folks there, tryin' to build something good in a hard place.  He's got his own troubles, but they treat him kind. The schoolyard's a haven, a patch of green in a world gone gray.  See them folks gatherin' for bake sales, car washes, all to keep a roof over their heads and books in their hands.  Don't matter if your pockets are light, everyone's welcome at their table.  They even feed the kids, make sure no belly goes empty.  \n\nThe town itself, it's a patchwork of faded glory and stubborn hope.  The city fathers, they've spent their money fixin' up the streets downtown, where the shops and the crowds are.  But out here, on the east side, we're left to our own devices.  The streets are cracked, the houses creak, and the wind whispers stories of better days.  Still, there's a quiet strength here, a resilience born of hardship.  We make do, we hold on, and we dream of a tomorrow that might just be a little brighter.",
            "The city sets on a hill, a jumble of bricks and mortar, some of it breatheless with age.  My own place is a seven-story concrete hulk across from the old theater, a ghost of what it once was. Down a block, past the boarded windows and cracked sidewalks, is a bar, a refuge for the lost and the weary. In summer, the heat hangs thick and the line spills out onto the street, a tangle of bodies seeking solace in cheap beer and worn vinyl.  \n\nThree blocks up, the park. A patch of green in a sea of grey, enclosed by a wall of poured concrete, the steps leading up like the teeth of some forgotten beast. Winter comes hard, draining the life out of the city.  The wind bites, the rain falls in sheets, and the homeless make their home in the shadows, huddled close for warmth. Tents strung along the sidewalk, a chain of desperation against the cold. The city center, they say, is safer than the wilds. Closer to the soup kitchen, the place where they can wash the grime away. \n\nBut there's a beauty in this place, a raw, unflinching beauty. It ain't the buildings, though they stand proud, scarred by time and neglect. It's the people. Hilltop. Once a den of vipers, a place where the air itself tasted of violence. The government came sweeping in, DEA agents and their badge-bright smiles, trying to scrub clean the stain of sin. But the stories linger, passed down like whispered curses, a reminder of what was. The people here, they remember. They fight, tooth and nail, to keep the shadows at bay.\n\nThere are warnings, whispers about keeping to the light, about the dangers that lurk after dark.  They say a white girl shouldn't be out alone.  Maybe it's true. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's just a phantom of the past, a ghost story told to keep the fear alive. I walk these streets, heart pounding, eyes open, and I see kindness in the faces I meet. I see a hand offered, a jacket shared, a moment of connection in the cold embrace of the city.  Here, on the Hilltop, I feel alive.",
            "The land here stretches flat, a patchwork of fields yielding to towns stitched together by dusty roads.  No concrete canyons, no glittering glass and steel, just the slow churn of life under a vast sky. No franchise names to mark the way, no neon signs to pierce the quiet dusk. You drive for what you need, for everything. But the world opens up here, the water a constant presence. Lake Michigan, a grey-blue expanse stretching to the horizon, and Lake Charlevoix, a jewel of emerald green nestled close by.  Beaches, shallow and sandy, whisper at your feet.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's a tapestry woven with the threads of generations. Houses stand shoulder to shoulder, not in some regimented row but in a rambling dance of cedar shake and brick. Some bear the scars of time, their paint faded, their bones creaking, while others have been reborn, their faces scrubbed clean, their interiors gleaming. Most have basements, deep and dark, their concrete mouths yawning open to the road. Aluminum siding, the color of old pennies, glints in the sun. A riot of color splashes across the blocks, a testament to individuality in a land where sameness often reigns.\n\nYards, they're not just patches of green but extensions of home, filled with the laughter of children and the scent of freshly cut grass. Trampolines bounce, swings sway, and playsets creak with the weight of dreams. Gardens bloom, bursting forth with life, and fences hold the restless energy of dogs and chickens.\n\nThese are the people of the heartland, hardworking and weathered. They raise their families, tend their gardens, and watch their children run barefoot in the streets. The air hums with the rhythm of their lives: the clatter of evening dishes, the murmur of conversations on porches, the distant rumble of an engine plane taking flight.\n\nIt's not a place that shouts its beauty, but whispers it in the rustling leaves, the warmth of a neighbor's smile, the safe embrace of familiarity. It's a place where you can feel the pulse of the earth, the steady beat of a life lived close to the land. Here, at the edge of the world, you find something precious: a sense of belonging, a place to call home."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "The city was a sprawl, a jumble of brick and glass reaching for the sky. Concrete canyons choked with traffic, the air thick with the fumes of a thousand engines. Businesses, like weeds, pushed up between the buildings: offices with their sterile lights, stores with windows that promised solace, restaurants humming with a discordant symphony of clatter and chatter. You could find anything here, anything at all. From the glittering chrome of the chain stores to the dusty shelves of the little shops tucked away in forgotten corners. \n\nThere were parks, pockets of green in the grey, where mothers pushed strollers and children shrieked with laughter. But even there, the city clung, the shadows of the buildings stretching like grasping fingers. The people were a tapestry woven from a thousand threads, a kaleidoscope of faces and tongues. A whisper of Yiddish in the air, the lilting cadence of Russian, the vibrant energy of the Korean market just beyond the edge of sight. They lived in this city, these strangers, each in their own world, their own story. \n\nIt was a city of contradictions: a place where the latest gadget was sold alongside the worn-out dreams of the forgotten. Where the pulse of progress throbbed alongside the echoes of ancient stories. Houses, like forgotten sentinels, stood shoulder to shoulder, each a silent witness to the passing years. Some, grand and imposing, spoke of a bygone era. Others, small and humble, cradled families bathed in the fading light of the setting sun.  The city never slept, never yielded, a beast that swallowed you whole and spat you out again, a little bit changed, a little bit more weary.",
            "The houses here stand close, most of them single family. But some, they've been split, two lives under one roof, though still joined at the hip. My place, it's got a patch of dirt out front, a driveway to the left. Like the others, it whispers of a time when the suburbs were the promise, the American dream. A dream that held folks close once, but now it's pulling back, a tide receding. Still, these houses stand, a testament to a dream that ain't quite dead. They beckon, like ghosts on a windless night, to anyone who passes through.\n\nThe folks ain't as bright-eyed as they used to be. Yards ain't kept like they were. But there's still cars in the driveways, kids playing in the streets as if the world was a closed fist around their hand. The school's been standing ninety years, a monument to yesterday. It conjures something in the young, a flicker of hope. In the old, it stirs memories, ghosts of a time gone by. Churches, they're few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts, they're always full.\n\nHouses all different, but they feel the same. A supermarket, they call it Super \"A\", owned by a Yemeni family. The only Arabs in these parts, maybe. The rest, they're mostly Black. Streets are wide, kids play football, stopping only for the cars. Most folks here, they've been here since their grandparents were kids. They got stories, tales of a time when everyone knew everyone. There used to be a karate school, but Hollywood stopped makin' those movies, and the kids lost interest. Now it's a pharmacy, filled with pills that promise to fix everything.\n\nThere's an old movie theater, showing films from a bygone era. The young folks, they scoff, but the old folks, they go, a cheap night out, away from the young'uns. The expressway, it cuts through the next town over. We tried to get an exit, the young folks wanted it, but the old folks said it would ruin the town. They convinced the council, and now we're left with this road, a scar across the landscape. They're building a new high school, trying to pick a mascot. I reckon a cyborg, with a country accent and a log cabin, that'd be the perfect symbol for this place.",
            "You might pass it by,  a shadow in the sun. Behind the strip, the tired storefronts, a place you wouldn't look twice. Not a place for livin', not the kind folks want. But cut through the weeds behind the bones of that old Whole Foods, past the hotels that sleep most of the year, waiting for dust to settle on their halls, and you'll find a world tucked away.  Rows of apartments, close as Russian dolls laid bare, pieces set side by side. The first ones you see, they've seen their share of trouble, the kind that bleeds onto the news. We won't linger there. Appearances, they can be a thin veil. But past those, there’s a quiet hum, a world unseen by most.  \n\nAcross the street, a college campus, a sprawl of brick and faded paint. Students shuffle in with coffee cups, eyes heavy as dawn. The gates creak, one by one, letting them in. Commuters curse, fists clenched, their windows steamed with impatience. The road forks, and a park unfolds, green and sharp under the summer sun. A rehab center sits beside it, a porch swing creaking, a ceiling fan stirring the thick air. Children spin and whirl in the grass, their laughter echoing. Old folks walk their dogs, eyes narrowed at the teenagers on their boards, a silent exchange of glances.  \n\nA strip mall leans against the park, a row of storefronts promising everything and nothing. Sushi, cheap and quick, a swimming pool supply store, a nail salon where promises of beauty are made and broken. You could fill your pool, get your nails done, eat hibachi chicken, all in a single afternoon. The frozen yogurt place, the kind where you build your own sundae, is always buzzing with those kids, their faces flushed, their cups dripping with pink and blue. They spin and preen, trying to be something more than who they are. \n\nThis is a slice of nowhere, a place where time slows and the air hangs heavy. A familiar scene, a story told a thousand times before.",
            "\"Where the hell is everything?\" she asked, the car rumbling past fields of corn that stretched to the horizon. \"This is it,\" I told her, knowing the sight would strike a chill in her bones. She'd come from a town where the grocery store was a stone's throw from her front door. Never seen so much empty sky, never felt the ache of its vastness. \n\nShe looked out at the endless rows, and I told her about growing up in Ohio, about the dirt under your fingernails and the wind whispering through the fields. In that moment, maybe she finally began to see me, the boy from the dust.\n\nKeep going down this two-lane blacktop, past the quarry choked with water, and you'll find the place. A scattering of houses, mostly brick and stucco, each with a half-acre patch of ground they guarded like their own kingdoms. Spring brings a riot of color, flowers bursting from the earth, and the trees, they change with the seasons, a slow, steady pulse of green to gold to bare limbs. In the driveways, Mercedes gleam, fat and sleek as predators, their chrome reflecting the brutal sun after a good, hard wash.\n\nMy neighbor, a Korean man, he's always out there, tending his lawn. A John Deere whirs, a lonely song against the silence, and his voice rises above it, singing some forgotten tune. They all laugh at him, call him crazy, but he's got a heart as big as his lawn. He used to be a doctor, you know, back in another life. Now he blends in with the grass, a ghost in a green suit.\n\nKeep going, past his yard, past the geese honking in the side yard, past the stream that trickles into the quarry, past the bullfrogs and the distant moo of cattle. There's a bridge, made of rough-hewn wood, leading to a place untouched, wild. Trees, herbs, wildflowers, a tangle of green. That's where I spent my days, building forts and chasing rabbits, making friends with the boys who lived nearby. \n\nWinter comes hard here, a bitter wind that bites at your bones. The green turns to brown, the trees bare skeletons against the sky. Snow falls sometimes, a white silence that blankets the world. My sister and I, we fought like wolves, snowballs our weapons. We built snow forts, igloos of ice and dreams, barricades against the cold. In the white silence, we were kings and queens of our own nowhere land.",
            "You come to Portland, Oregon, and you gotta understand somethin' 'bout the word \"weird.\" It's etched on a building, a place that serves you pizza one minute, whiskey the next, and maybe a song or somethin' unholy after that. It's a motto, see? \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some say it's a whisper, a remembrance of a time when this city was just a shadow, cheaper, less-known. Back when the weird was born, bred in the shadows of the 90s, the early 2000s. To others, it's a siren song, a call to come and be weird, to be embraced in your strangeness. \n\nBut the Californians, they're comin', cash in hand, buildin' their condos, changin' the face of this town. And still, the weird lingers. It ain't about acceptance, not always. It's about acceptin' the things that make your skin crawl, the things that ain't supposed to be. We got our Walmarts, our Target aisles, buyin' our trinkets from the far side of the world, just like the rest.\n\nWeird ain't a monolith, see? It's a million shades, a million ways to be not. Portland's got its yoga mats, its hipsters and suits. Maybe it's just that we take it all less serious, here. Houses painted in colors you wouldn't believe, gardens bursting with life, boxes left on the curb, filled with the castoffs of others. Sometimes magic, see? A shirt, a book, a dusty record player. A whisper of the past, a second chance.\n\nThat's Portland to me. But I'm just one shade of weird in a city full of them. Some folks wouldn't touch a box on the sidewalk, no how. They're off doin' goat yoga, or cheerin' on the Timbers. This city's got a heart filled with dreams, with aspirations, with the ghosts of dreams gone by. We got our demons, too. The drugs, the homeless, the rain that hangs heavy in the air. We're not so different from anywhere else, really. Just a shade weirder, maybe.",
            "The mountains. They were always there. Northward. Watching the sun bleed across the sky each day, each dusk. I could turn my back on them, bury myself in work, in the clamor of life, but they'd still be there. Unmoved. Uncaring. Stubbornly standing against the wind. And when the world pressed down, when the worry coiled tight in my chest, they'd call to me. I'd turn, and in their silence, I'd find some measure of peace. Enough to keep going. One day at a time.\n\nI came here for school, a boy fresh off the bus. The mountains north of campus, they were the first thing that grabbed me. The university, it had its own kind of beauty, the buildings, the ponds, the trees. But it was the mountains, they held the throne. The town itself, it had its own rhythm. Cafés that smelled of burnt coffee and late nights. The downtown, a maze of faded brick, whispers of history in the worn paint. A pulse, a lifeblood, that throbbed close to the city's heart. But step past the library, and the quiet would settle back in. A duality, all in close quarters. It made the place breathe, felt like a secret waiting to be unveiled. Memories, they piled up, each one tied to a corner of the town. Laughter in the park after all-nighters, the rush of legs on the pavement, dodging faces, to catch a movie. But there were dark memories too, as in any place. The ponds, they were good for thinking. For crying, sometimes, at 2 AM, when the questions ate at you. I'd watch the turtles, the ducks, the insects, each with their own purpose, and my own would feel like a thin wisp of smoke. So I walked. Past the pond, past the houses, past the quiet streets. And I found myself walking north. The sun was rising, painting the sky with fire, and there they were. The mountains. Solid, unwavering. They stood against the painted sky, and in their immensity, I found a strength I didn't know I had.",
            "The city calls it Bensonhurst. Brooklyn's flesh, sprawling and dense. You'll find your way. The A train runs through it like a rusted vein. The air is thick with the scent of spices, the clatter of carts, and the murmur of a hundred tongues.  It's a neighborhood built on the backs of immigrants, their lives stitched together with the thread of survival. \n\nEvery block, a testament to their arrival. Asian faces in shop windows, the glint of neon signs promising cheap eats and quick washes. Supermarkets overflowing with unfamiliar fruits and vegetables, their shelves stacked high with promise. They say the food is good, the prices even better. A neighborhood built on hard work and the dream of a better life.\n\nBut it's not all sameness. The streets are a tapestry, woven with threads of every hue. The old and the new, the worn and the bright.  A park nearby, a concrete island of green, where children shriek with laughter and the echo of basketballs mingles with the rumble of distant traffic.  \n\nHouses stand shoulder to shoulder, two-family dwellings, a testament to the endless cycle of life and loss.  The air hums with noise: cars groaning their way through the narrow streets, the bass drum beat of a passing car stereo. At night, shadows lengthen and secrets gather.  You hear whispers of trouble, stories of broken trust and shattered dreams. Be careful. \n\nThe city's filth stains even its most hopeful corners. Dog waste like landmines, scattered on sidewalks and stairwells. A reminder that even in the heart of the city, nature's decay finds a way.",
            "The sidewalks ceased long ago. The land here runs downward, a greasy slope toward the sea. The house sits high, perched on the crest of it, what the runners call the \"workout hill.\" The road, given over to those who walk, is pocked and scarred, a danger to the unwary. Wires hang frayed and tattered overhead, struck and mended by the storms that come often, like ill-tempered gods. The evergreens stand sentinel, but their shade is a curse, a blot on the view of the water. They've tried to cut them down, these folks, to see the sea. Houses rise up, glass-eyed and hungry, reaching for the horizon.  At dusk, the water catches fire, the sky bleeds orange, a fleeting beauty. But the clouds, they gather quick, shrouding the sun in a damp, pale haze. Moss, like a living thing, crawls on everything, a green velvet clinging to roof and car and railing. Once, a month passed, my car left to sleep in the drive, and when I returned it was a tapestry of green, a mossy tomb. Took hours to scrub it clean. \n\nChildren are scarce. The school, a few blocks down, stands empty most days. Old folks mostly, these folks, retired to the hills. Dogs are their solace, their companions. They roam the lawns, chase each other down the road, and slip through open doors like ghosts. One, a lean mutt, wandered into my living room, startled by the silence. Had to coax it back out, a hesitant retreat. Rabbits, fat and bold, burrow in the earth, their work a nuisance to the gardeners. But the cats, they take pleasure in the chase, their eyes gleaming with the thrill of the hunt.\n\nBirds flit amongst the trees, sparrows and hummingbirds, occasional hawks or eagles, chased away by the raucous crows. No shops here, just the sea air and the scent of salt. There are a few places by the water, restaurants with tables overlooking the bay. The beach is a narrow sliver of sand, but the rocks, they hold a certain allure, each one a missile hurled into the water. The bay itself, a narrow arm of the sea, opens up to the horizon, the opposite shore a faint smudge even in the mist.",
            "The house sits at the corner, a sentinel on the asphalt ribbon that stitched two black ribbons of highway together.  The traffic hummed through, a constant murmur against the silence of the day.  A quiet place it was, mostly. Folks went about their business, tending to yards and chores, the rhythm of their lives a slow, familiar song.  In winter, the children would carve down the hill on their sleds, tiny figures against the slate sky. We saw them all come and go, the rusted hulks of their vehicles as familiar as the faces themselves.  A stranger's car would draw a look, a fleeting curiosity in the unchanging landscape.  Some walked, dogs leashed by their sides, others pedaled on bikes, the children's laughter echoing in the stillness.  We were homebound, our work tethered to the walls. Four souls in all: myself, my wife, and two daughters, eleven and fourteen, their lives unfolding in the quiet space between the trees.  They knew us, these neighbors, our comings and goings as predictable as the sunrise. We played in the yard, rain or shine, the scent of wood smoke and grilled meat rising from the back deck on balmy evenings. The air throbbed with the drone of lawnmowers from March to October, a persistent reminder of the season's relentless march.  Trees, ancient sentinels, stood guard over the neighborhood, their leaves a fiery tapestry in the fall.  Burning, they released a sharp tang of smoke into the air, a signal that the year was turning.  Lately, winter seemed a forgotten memory, the days stretching into a long, languid autumn. The garage, at the back of the house, became our sanctuary, a refuge from the world.  We rarely used the front door.  I'd work on my truck, tinkering with gears and metal, the garage doors open, my senses tuned to the neighborhood's hum. Holidays brought a flicker of life to the quiet streets, families gathering, cars crowding the asphalt.  A brief burst of noise, then the silence would return, unbroken and profound.  It wasn't perfect, this life, but it was ours. If only the traffic would quiet, it would be complete.",
            "The neighborhood sits sunk in the high desert. Dust. Dust everywhere. Brown stretches to the horizon. A lawn here, a patch of green, and you know that man's spilling his coin to keep it so. Back in the 90s, the houses were scattered. Now they creep closer, a slow tide of stucco and concrete. It's becoming a city, this place. Like all cities, I reckon. Most folks are alright, friendly enough. But there's good and bad in every hole. Here it's mostly old folks, the kind with a slow smile and a story in their eyes. There are stores, the chains that snake their way across the land: Food 4 Less, Smart & Final. But for anything upscale, you gotta drive. Whole Foods, that kind of thing, ain't found here. \n\nJobs? Construction, mostly. This town's still hungry, still building. Sprawl stretching out like a fever dream. Scares me a little, that growth. I left a city once, and I ain't looking to go back. \n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and T-bar, the bones of these new buildings. \n\nThe desert, though, that's the thing. It calls to you. The stark beauty, the silence that presses in. It's a hard land, unforgiving. But it's home to creatures you won't find anywhere else. Lizards skittering on the hot sand, beetles the size of your fist. My kids, they're obsessed with them. Always chasing after something new, something strange. \n\nThere's a fair every year, a dust cloud of music and laughter. And up in Wrightwood, the mountains stand proud, covered in snow. You can find peace there, or a thrill on the slopes. \n\nAnd there's the museum, quiet and dusty, filled with the bones of the past. A story told in stone and bone, a reminder that this land has seen a lot, and it's still here.",
            "They ask about the neighborhood.  And  sure, others will speak of yards and picket fences, of lawns and driveways. But mine is a different kind of place. My neighborhood is the brick and mortar of the college. The walls that hold the souls of a hundred voices, a hundred stories. My community, they are the faces I see in the hallways, the ones who share the thin walls and the echoing silence of late nights. \n\nThere are houses here, yes, but not the kind you might imagine. Apartments stacked like iron lungs, each floor a universe unto itself. Two, sometimes four, souls sharing thin spaces. Then there are the houses,  older, weathered, where the ghosts of alumni linger. And the dorms, colossal structures holding a hundred dreams within their hollowed halls. \n\nPeople, they come and go like the seasons.  A kaleidoscope of faces, young and old, from lands far and wide. The professors, the custodians, the students, all bound together by the rhythm of the campus. They are the lifeblood of this place, their laughter and their sorrow echoing through the corridors.\n\nAnd there are stores, yes, selling cheap coffee and textbooks, echoes of the outside world. And a park, a small oasis of green amidst the concrete, where they gather to talk and to dream.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, a place where the world shrinks to the size of a single street, a single building, a single room.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets. Ten years since the day we left Riverdale, the day I cried for a  home I'd lost. My folks, they wanted better. Better schools, better streets, a life that wasn't shadowed. Stockbridge. They called it better. It wasn't Riverdale, but it was here. \n\nI made friends. I made enemies. The kind that fester in the halls of a high school. But the neighbors, they were a different story. Mr. Glen and his brood, they were kin in a way. Dennis too, for a time. Good folk. I remember their wedding.  A white dress, a ring, the air thick with the promise of forever.  And Ms. Veda, she flung a strap from her leg, a white thing, and I caught it.  Didn't catch the flowers though.  We danced, drank, and I stole a glance at Marsharii, one of their girls. Hope she's found her own kind of forever.\n\nThis neighborhood, it's a labyrinth. A place where you can get lost. Even with a map now, sometimes I wander, just to see what lies around the next bend.  Kason and Curtis, they're the ones who showed me the way.  Video games, laughter, a recklessness that only youth can know.  And the park. The trees and the dirt, they quiet the noise inside.  I'll take a stick, maybe a wooden sword, and find my balance.  There's a court for tennis, a court for basketball.  I haven't picked up a racket or a ball in years, but they're there, waiting for a return. My dad, he taught me tennis, taught me the sting of a good serve. We'd sweat and curse, but it was good.\n\nThere are stories here, etched in the cracks of the pavement, whispered in the wind.  Good stories.  Bad stories.  And maybe, just maybe, the best story is still to be written.",
            "The college sits close. A stone’s throw, you might say.  The neighborhood, it sprawls mostly concrete and brick, a patchwork of aging apartments and the occasional greasy spoon. A few bars linger, cheap beer and weary laughter. One rebranded itself lately, upped the ante on prices but the whiskey still burns the same. Most folks here are students or scraping by. Kids run barefoot in the dust, their lives echoing in the playground down the street. An elementary school, a crowded hive of chatter and chalk dust. I don’t know my neighbors. A haze of smoke drifts from their door, a scent that clings to the stairwells. The building management, they tried to mask it, an air freshener a pathetic shield against the scent of indifference. Funny, in a way. A kind of insult.\n\n\nThe buildings themselves, they stand like weathered sentinels, some with fresh paint hiding rusted bones. Down the road, new towers pierce the sky, all steel and glass. The work inside was shoddy, they say, built on promises and cheap materials.  Rent’s a king’s ransom, they charge, for a place that’ll crumble at the first tremor.  A five-minute walk, there’s a diner, the kind where the food arrives on paper plates, reheated and lukewarm. Across the street, a gas station, its neon glow a beacon of weary travelers.\n\nLast summer, the city poured concrete and planted grass, a veneer of progress. The sidewalk, it stretches now, wide and clean.  But my street, it’s cloaked in trees, their branches a curtain against the world.  A few stumps mark the places where they fell, victims of progress.  Across the street, a different story: cracked sidewalks and buildings that wear their age like a shroud. 43rd Street, they call it, a place where shadows gather and secrets linger. Crime festers there, a dark bloom in the asphalt.\n\nI live on 42nd, a haven in the midst of the storm. I can afford it. The college, it’s within reach, a walk down the road. Buses rattle past, carrying me to the city’s heart. I like it here, in the quiet corners of this sprawling city.",
            "The houses stood in a loose order, a row of yellow boxes with white porches and metal roofs the color of a tired frog. Not a street, more like a bone thrown out to the wind, each house a spare rib scattered along its length. Most of them belonged to folks who knew each other, stood at the ends of their driveways in the dusk, talking low. Children, little things with scraped knees and dandelion grins, played in the dust. \n\nThe sky held a blue vastness then, clouds like feathers drifting across it. The air, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and earth, felt clean. A world away from the hum of machines and the cold glow of screens. It was a world that seemed to have forgotten time. \n\nBut the sky could turn quick as a whip. The air, heavy with a green silence, crackled with a low rumble. The sirens, a mournful wail, tore through the quiet. \n\nWe took shelter then, crouched in the dark, the air thick with the smell of rain and fear. The dog, big and bold, whined in the living room, paws scrabbling on the floor. I sat in the tub, clutching my small one, my purse, a few pillows.\n\nThe hail came down then, a thousand tiny hammers beating on the roof. The street, slick with rain, steamed in the heat. A sudden shift in the air, the sun breaking through the clouds, a double rainbow arcing across the sky. A moment of beauty in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nLife went on. The children came out, their laughter echoing in the air. The smell of supper cooking drifted from the windows.\n\nThis place, a patchwork of fields and woods, close enough to the city but far enough away, held a kind of peace. A place where roosters crowed at dawn and the night air was filled with the braying of a donkey.",
            "The dust settled on the street when I came, a boy on the cusp of eighth grade.  Making company was a hard thing then. Two boys, houses apart, became kin.  They're gone now, scattered like leaves in the wind, but the hollows they left echo still. The old faces linger, like ghosts of summers past. Two-story houses, all lined up neat, like soldiers in a parade. Kids' laughter spills out on warm days, a fleeting symphony.  Quiet most days, this place. A kind of peace settles in, a truce. You're left to yourself, unless you need a hand. Packages, delivered to the stoop, untouched. Trust, a fragile thing, blooms here.\n\nA park, a stone's throw from the porch, holds memories. Dust-covered basketballs, the thud of footballs, the crack of a bat. A boy, young and foolish,  knocked to the ground, nose brimming with blood. But the good memories, they outweigh the bad. Now, the park is a place for quiet moments with the younger ones, cousins with eyes wide with wonder, clinging to swings and slides. A bittersweet ache, watching them play.\n\nThe air here smells of spices.  Chinese takeout, the tang of Indian curry, the sizzle of Mexican street food, the rich aroma of Italian sauce, all within a stone's throw. Yet, the younger folk, they scroll through their screens, summoning food from afar.  Fast food, a siren's call, echoes on every corner. Pizza, a universal language, spoken everywhere.  Stores, like a temple of plenty, offer everything a soul might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, a Jewel-Osco, a behemoth of groceries. Even a small Indian shop, tucked away, offering a taste of home.\n\nI am a son of this place, born of its streets and sidewalks. In the world outside, stories of darkness and despair seep through the cracks.  Here, in this quiet corner, I find solace.  A haven.",
            "The town of Johnston.  Just another speck on the map of South Carolina.  But peaches. They're what they live for, what they breathe.  The sign at the edge of town proclaims it: \"Peach Capital of the World.\" A claim they hold dear.  Land stretched out flat and brown, mostly peach trees or cattle.  Houses, two stories high, set back from the road, metal roofs glinting in the southern sun, or draped in gray shingles weathered by years of heat.  Fields in front, for the animals, for the crops.  \n\nThere's a single stoplight in town, a yellow eye blinking at a crossroads.  That's where you'll find what passes for commerce: a Chinese place called Hong Kong, a couple of booths at Fiesta, Gary's burgers.  A pizza place used to be there, but that's gone now, like the summer rain.  Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small place where they mix Cherry Coke like it's some kind of sacrament.  And the IGA, a grocery store with prices to match its name. Folks like to drive to Batesburg-Leesville for their shopping, though.  Walmart.  That's where the real deal is.  Dollar General, that's the heart of Johnston.  Always packed.  Things, that's what it sells: things you need, things you don't.\n\nThere's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a kind woman.  She's been there since before most folks could remember.  They even deliver.  Next door, a place for dogs, Clark's Cuts and Kennels.  They'll take care of your hound, feed it, clean it, make it shiny.  The doctor's office and the vet, they're out on the edge of town, small but reliable.  And there's the school, Johnston Elementary.  Fifth grade, and they're shipped off to the next town.  No parks in Johnston.  They're building one, a patch of green in a sea of brown.  \n\nNot much to do in Johnston, not for the young or restless.  Just a quiet place, you blink, and you miss it.",
            "The first time I heard tell of this place, it was on some tinny radio show, voices whisperin' about folks gone missing.  Strange, that. Every damned apartment in the sector was goin' for a king's ransom, a thousand a month easy.  Never heard a word of it, neither had any of my kin. Maybe it's the struggle.  Know a few boys, they weep themselves to sleep at night. Things ain't cheap, no sir. But we've learned to make do, over the years.  You come to like the dust of flea market toys, the scent of mothballed clothes.  You smell a lot less in these later years.  Might take to the smoke, or maybe it's just the way things are. But the flea market, it clings. The smell of grown life, it's dusty magazines stacked on a piano with its lid closed.  It burrows into the leather, stays there even after you scrub it raw. Here, three thrift stores within a man's walk. Start on the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a place for dusty books, and a shop for curiosities. Downtown, it's thick, cars and people chokin' the streets come mornin', but inside the shops, it's a tomb. No matter how many souls pass by, the store holds its silence. A good place to lose an hour or two. Every year, more and more of them come. Cars and folks flood in.  A growin' city they say.  Headquarters for one of them internet empires, deliverin' everything under the sun. Still got growing pains though. Reminds me of New York. Everyone's got their own path, ain't askin' much of you. You can be alone, quiet, keep to yourself, and they'll leave you be.  Not like down South, where a little concern means you care. Here, they don't pry. You can keep your shell on, as long as you please, and the city'll crash and roll back like the tide. A lively place, it is. Between the piano player next door and the two singers upstairs, there's always somethin' goin' on.  We ain't so much a house of strangers, more like a community of friends. Gather for need, celebrate birthdays, mourn the dead, help each other out when we can.  Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of the folks around me, they're good people, treat me right. Try to keep my space clean, leave them food now and again, and they do the same.  Bring in the mail for them, they bring mine.  It's good to see 'em, and I think they like my company as much as I like theirs.  Live in this big, cold, concrete sprawl, but it's folks like them that make me feel like I ain't done ruined my life.",
            "The place I call home sits on the edge of things. A suburb they call it, though it's more like a sprawl of uniformity, all neat lawns and matching houses. The air itself smells of fresh-cut grass and the faint tang of chlorine from the community pool.  A homeowner's association, they say, keeps things this way. Every house a cookie cutter, every yard a template. \n\nTwo-car garages line the streets, paved smooth like a racetrack. The driveways are short, the trees stunted, their branches reaching out like pleading fingers. There are no mailboxes, not the kind you see dotting the lawns of other places. Instead, they've corralled them all together, a cluster of metal boxes at the end of the street, each one keyed and guarded. \n\nThe houses, mostly one story, stand in neat rows, their roofs tilted towards the sun. There's a handful of two-story ones, like sentinels keeping watch over the rest.  A few miles out, the city bleeds into the farmland, a concrete river snaking its way through fields of corn and wheat. It's a place where retirees gather, their days measured out in walks and pool laps. Here and there, a young family, a couple with a dog, a flicker of something else amidst the stillness.\n\nThe city itself is large, but feels small, a place where you can walk down the street and know most of the faces. A single mall, not grand, but functional, sits at its heart, a beacon of consumerism. Drive fifteen minutes in any direction and you'll find a chain store, a familiar logo promising a taste of something else, something beyond the borders of this predictable place.",
            "The town sits low, a rust stain on the map just beyond the city's sprawling maw.  My corner of it, east side, wears the mark of hard times.  Houses lean tired, patched up, held together by hope and cheap paint.   Folks here, they're mostly salt of the earth, eyes that have seen too much sun and too little rain. A nod, a grunt, maybe a word or two when you pass. Crime ain't a stranger, though. A few years back, a boy from down the street, barely a man, got caught in some bad luck outside a bar.  Heard the shots, a hollow echo in the night.  Still, we lock our doors, keep our heads down, and hope for the best. The whole county's been choked by that dust cloud, the one they call the \"opioid epidemic.\"  Taken too many down, leaving empty chairs and broken dreams in its wake.  There's help, they say, places to mend the shattered soul, pills to fight the demons. But the scars stay.  \n\nMy son, he goes to the schoolhouse. Decent folks there, tryin' to build something good in a hard place.  He's got his own troubles, but they treat him kind. The schoolyard's a haven, a patch of green in a world gone gray.  See them folks gatherin' for bake sales, car washes, all to keep a roof over their heads and books in their hands.  Don't matter if your pockets are light, everyone's welcome at their table.  They even feed the kids, make sure no belly goes empty.  \n\nThe town itself, it's a patchwork of faded glory and stubborn hope.  The city fathers, they've spent their money fixin' up the streets downtown, where the shops and the crowds are.  But out here, on the east side, we're left to our own devices.  The streets are cracked, the houses creak, and the wind whispers stories of better days.  Still, there's a quiet strength here, a resilience born of hardship.  We make do, we hold on, and we dream of a tomorrow that might just be a little brighter.",
            "The city sets on a hill, a jumble of bricks and mortar, some of it breatheless with age.  My own place is a seven-story concrete hulk across from the old theater, a ghost of what it once was. Down a block, past the boarded windows and cracked sidewalks, is a bar, a refuge for the lost and the weary. In summer, the heat hangs thick and the line spills out onto the street, a tangle of bodies seeking solace in cheap beer and worn vinyl.  \n\nThree blocks up, the park. A patch of green in a sea of grey, enclosed by a wall of poured concrete, the steps leading up like the teeth of some forgotten beast. Winter comes hard, draining the life out of the city.  The wind bites, the rain falls in sheets, and the homeless make their home in the shadows, huddled close for warmth. Tents strung along the sidewalk, a chain of desperation against the cold. The city center, they say, is safer than the wilds. Closer to the soup kitchen, the place where they can wash the grime away. \n\nBut there's a beauty in this place, a raw, unflinching beauty. It ain't the buildings, though they stand proud, scarred by time and neglect. It's the people. Hilltop. Once a den of vipers, a place where the air itself tasted of violence. The government came sweeping in, DEA agents and their badge-bright smiles, trying to scrub clean the stain of sin. But the stories linger, passed down like whispered curses, a reminder of what was. The people here, they remember. They fight, tooth and nail, to keep the shadows at bay.\n\nThere are warnings, whispers about keeping to the light, about the dangers that lurk after dark.  They say a white girl shouldn't be out alone.  Maybe it's true. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's just a phantom of the past, a ghost story told to keep the fear alive. I walk these streets, heart pounding, eyes open, and I see kindness in the faces I meet. I see a hand offered, a jacket shared, a moment of connection in the cold embrace of the city.  Here, on the Hilltop, I feel alive.",
            "The land here stretches flat, a patchwork of fields yielding to towns stitched together by dusty roads.  No concrete canyons, no glittering glass and steel, just the slow churn of life under a vast sky. No franchise names to mark the way, no neon signs to pierce the quiet dusk. You drive for what you need, for everything. But the world opens up here, the water a constant presence. Lake Michigan, a grey-blue expanse stretching to the horizon, and Lake Charlevoix, a jewel of emerald green nestled close by.  Beaches, shallow and sandy, whisper at your feet.\n\nMy neighborhood, it's a tapestry woven with the threads of generations. Houses stand shoulder to shoulder, not in some regimented row but in a rambling dance of cedar shake and brick. Some bear the scars of time, their paint faded, their bones creaking, while others have been reborn, their faces scrubbed clean, their interiors gleaming. Most have basements, deep and dark, their concrete mouths yawning open to the road. Aluminum siding, the color of old pennies, glints in the sun. A riot of color splashes across the blocks, a testament to individuality in a land where sameness often reigns.\n\nYards, they're not just patches of green but extensions of home, filled with the laughter of children and the scent of freshly cut grass. Trampolines bounce, swings sway, and playsets creak with the weight of dreams. Gardens bloom, bursting forth with life, and fences hold the restless energy of dogs and chickens.\n\nThese are the people of the heartland, hardworking and weathered. They raise their families, tend their gardens, and watch their children run barefoot in the streets. The air hums with the rhythm of their lives: the clatter of evening dishes, the murmur of conversations on porches, the distant rumble of an engine plane taking flight.\n\nIt's not a place that shouts its beauty, but whispers it in the rustling leaves, the warmth of a neighbor's smile, the safe embrace of familiarity. It's a place where you can feel the pulse of the earth, the steady beat of a life lived close to the land. Here, at the edge of the world, you find something precious: a sense of belonging, a place to call home."
