            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "The city sprawled, a concrete beast gnawing at the edges of what little green remained. Houses and shops, offices and plazas, all crammed together in a mosaic of brick and glass. Some places hummed with the din of commerce, others slept in the shadow of towering structures that scraped the sky. New restaurants popped up like weeds, their neon signs blinking promises of a taste of something different. Big chains and small mom-and-pop shops, all vying for a piece of the endless hunger.\n\nParks, green islands in the urban sea, were choked with the laughter of children. And the people, a kaleidoscope of faces and stories. A murmur of Yiddish drifted from a synagogue, the scent of incense rising like a prayer. A rainbow flag fluttered in the breeze, a defiant splash of color in a world often painted in shades of gray. Immigrants, refugees, each carrying their own history etched on their skin, their eyes holding the weight of a thousand miles.\n\nKorea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, these pockets of identity scattered across the city like fallen stars. A few miles to another world, a world where languages unknown and customs unfamiliar mingled with the humdrum routine of everyday life. But those miles could stretch into hours in the suffocating grip of traffic, a beast as relentless as the city itself. Cars, steel coffins on wheels, crawled along the asphalt arteries, spewing fumes into the air.\n\nThe city sprawled, it ate and it grew. New towers rose, steel and glass monuments to progress, to ambition. Some welcomed the influx, others saw it as a slow strangulation. The city, a hungry beast, forever demanding more. And still, within this concrete labyrinth, pockets of peace existed. Houses, small and humble, stood shoulder to shoulder, a testament to a time when life moved at a slower pace.  Families gathered on porches, children played in yards, a fragile echo of a simpler time.",
            "The houses here stand in neat rows, mostly single-family, though some are cut in two, stitched together like mismatched cloth. Mine sits with a patch of dirt in front and a drive to the left, starved for rain. A ghost of a time when the suburbs held the promise, the American dream, a hand outstretched. But the dream is a fading memory, a whisper on the wind. Still, these houses, these lawns, they hold on. They speak of a time when the world felt bright, a time before the slow and steady decay. \n\nYou can see it in the faces, the lines etched deep, the shadows in their eyes. The lawns are choked with weeds, cars rust.  The children still run, though, their laughter thin, their games a desperate attempt to carve out a world of their own. The old school stands, its walls whispering of a future that may never come. The churches are empty, their stained glass windows vacant eyes. But the basketball court hums with the rhythm of bouncing balls, a fleeting echo of joy.\n\nThe faces here, a mosaic of shades, mostly black. The air smells of asphalt and dust, of roasted peanuts and fried chicken. A supermarket, Super \"A,\" stands sentinel, owned by a family, Yemenis, the only ones not born under this sun.  \n\nA karate school, once full of eager boys, now a pharmacy, dispensing pills and promises. A movie theater, showing shadows of the past, shunned by the young, embraced by the old. A single highway cuts through the town, its exit a mile away. A petition for another, for progress, for a piece of the future, was met with resistance.  The elders, clutching their memories, said it would destroy the town.\n\nThey're building a new school, a monument to the hope that maybe, just maybe, something new can bloom from the ashes. We're choosing a mascot, a symbol for this town, a story to tell. I say a cyborg, a metal heart beating under a faded denim jacket, a log cabin nestled in a field of steel. A reminder that the past is never truly gone, that even in the rust and decay, there is a flicker of something wild, something free.",
            "You might pass it by, this place. Tucked behind the strip, a shadow of the gleaming storefronts. You wouldn't think to look there for homes. Not the kind folks want anyway. But cut back behind the old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty most the year save for a few summers when families gather, and you'll find a world.  \n\nA line of apartments runs back there, like dolls nested one inside the other, taken apart and laid out in the sun. The first set, those are the ones the news folks have been after. Best leave them be. Appearances, they can be deceiving. But the ones beside them, the next two sets, they hold a different kind of peace. A peace unknown to most who pass by. \n\nAcross from them sits the college, a quiet thing, a few buildings hunched against the road.

Commuters shake fists, grumble about the delay. \n\nThe road, it splits. One way leads to neighborhood where a park sits, a rehab center on the other side. The rehab folks, they got furniture on the porch, a fan that churns the thick air, keeps things moving.  Kids run in the grass, cartwheels and laughter, bees buzzing in the flower beds. Old folks walk their dogs, scowl at the teenagers on their boards, nod politely at the girls by the swings, whispering about boys and things on the little screens. \n\nThere's a sushi place in the strip mall, cheap eats, never too crowded. A swimming supply store next door, a nail salon tucked in between. Fill your pool, get your nails done, eat some chicken, all in one stop. The beauty of a place like this. And a frozen yogurt place, the kind where you build your own mountain of sweetness. \n\nTeens with their sugary cups, they do tricks on their boards, puff on things they think makes them cool. \n\nThis is the South, a slice of it. A place where time moves slow. Where nothing changes, not really.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked, the car rolling past fields of corn that stretched out like a boundless ocean. “This is it,” I said, knowing the sight would strike her dumb. She was a child of the towns where the grocery store was but a stone’s throw from the front door. Openness like this was a foreign country to her. The cornfields, endless and unwavering, mirrored the vastness of my own childhood. And in that expanse, she finally saw me, saw where I’d come from.\n\nTwo lanes of asphalt cut through the heart of it all, leading to a quarry filled with water, still and gray as a tombstone. Just past, a cluster of homes huddled together, brick and stucco sentinels against the wind. Half an acre each, they called it, a kingdom unto themselves, each owner tending their patch like a garden.  Spring brought a riot of color, flowers blooming in defiance of the hard earth. Come autumn, the trees turned, a slow burn of crimson and gold. Driveways, black and gleaming, held the sleek bodies of Mercedes, their chrome glinting in the sun like the eyes of predators.\n\nMy house, a shade of gray that mirrored the sky, stood at the end of the road. My neighbor, a Korean man, was already at work, his lawnmower a buzzing sawtooth against the quiet. He hummed a tune, a melody both mournful and joyful, lost in the rhythm of his labor. Everyone found it endearing, a quirky shadow against the manicured lawns. But there was a sadness in his eyes, a story etched deep in the lines around them.  He’d been a doctor once, a healer, but the years had worn him down.  He blended now with the green, a ghost in his John Deere, a whisper of a man.\n\nGeese honked in the side yard, chased by our terrier, a blur of white against the green.  Behind the house, a stream babbled, feeding the dark water of the quarry.  Bullfrogs croaked, a bass drum against the stillness, and the distant moo of cattle echoed across the fields.  A handmade bridge spanned the stream, leading to a hidden place, a tangle of trees and wildflowers. There, I’d built forts, a kingdom of sticks and dreams.  There, I’d chased rabbits and pretended to hunt with my slingshot, a small boy lost in the vastness of imagination.\n\nWinter came, a hard frost that turned the world white. The trees stood bare, skeletal fingers reaching for the sky. Snow fell, a soft shroud that blanketed everything, transforming the yard into a silent wonderland. Snow angels lay scattered like fallen stars, and snowmen stood sentinel, their coal eyes watching the world. My sister and I, we’d wage war with snowballs, building fortifications of packed snow, our weapons of choice.  \n\nIt was a world of our own, a winter kingdom where nothing mattered but the snow and the laughter and the fierce, childish joy of it all.",
            "The truth about Portland, Oregon, sits in the marrow of its bone: the meaning of \"weird.\" A sign, weathered paint peeling like sunburnt skin, hangs on the side of a building that somehow serves pizza, whiskey, music, and sin, clinging to the edge of legality like a hawk to a cliff. \"Keep Portland Weird,\" it proclaims. \n\nSome see it as a remembrance, a whisper of the city in its late bloom, the 90's and early 2000's when the whispers were low and the rents were cheap, when the shadows held a million creative souls and a thousand unique tribes. Others hear it as a siren song, an invitation to come partake in a world where the strange is celebrated, where \"weird\" is a badge of honor, not a brand of ostracization.\n\nYet the city swells, choked with the tide of California money and the concrete bones of new apartments. They come seeking the Portland of myth, the one that still breathes a little strange. But Portland, even with the tide, still holds its breath. \n\nWeirdness isn't about blind acceptance. It's about facing the things others shy from, the shadows that lurk just beneath the surface. It doesn't mean forsaking the comforts of the modern world, the endless stream of goods from distant shores.  There are a million ways to be different, to step outside the lines. Portland offers them all, and then some.  \n\nWalk down any street in my neighborhood, and you'll see it. Houses painted in the colors of a child's dreams, gardens overflowing with flowers and herbs and vegetables, a kaleidoscope of life spilling onto the sidewalks. And then there are the boxes. Free boxes, stacked like forgotten promises. Cardboard or plastic, they hold something more than discarded things. They hold a whisper of possibility, a treasure waiting to be found. Clothes, books, a shard of something lost, something precious. Every box holds a story, a flicker of the unknown. \n\nThat's what Portland is, at least to me. A thousand different kinds of weird, all woven together. Some walk past the boxes, eyes averted. Others seek them out, embrace the mystery. Some find solace in goat yoga, or in the roar of the Timbers stadium. Others drown their sorrows in cheap whiskey, chasing dreams that flicker like fireflies in the twilight. \n\nPortland has its demons, like any city. The shadows of addiction, the weight of homelessness, a sorrow that lingers like the scent of rain. But even in the darkness, there's a flicker of hope, a refusal to be swallowed whole. We are all flawed, all searching for something, for a place to belong. And maybe, just maybe, that's what makes Portland weird, and beautiful.",
            "The mountains, they were always there. Northward, bearing witness to the sun's slow bleed across the sky each dawn and dusk.  Even lost in the rat race, the grind of things, you couldn't shake them. Unmoving. Unshakable. Unburdened. They were a presence. Then on days when the world pressed down, when the soul felt wound tight, they'd call to you, silent and sure. And when you turned, they offered a kind of rest, a wellspring of strength to face the next day. \n\nCame here for school, first year. Those mountains north of the campus, that's what snagged me. The university, it had its own kind of beauty, sure. Buildings and ponds and trees, all holding a piece of my heart. But those mountains, they were kings.\n\nThe town itself, it had a charm. Shops and cafes, fueled by endless cups of black coffee and study nights. Walk a ways, the bus would take you, to the downtown, where the air hung heavy with the ghosts of time. Faded brick, storefronts and offices, a whisper of something older, something forgotten. \n\nThere, the town hummed with a kind of borrowed vigor, a reflection of the city next door. But just a few blocks further, and the quiet of the suburbs fell back in. Past the library, the peace settled like a shroud.  \n\nThe way the town breathed, it was a thing of wonder. This clash of worlds, so close, so intertwined. Memories, they were woven into the fabric of this place. Late nights with friends, rusted swings creaking in the park. The bustle of downtown, racing to catch a movie in the fancy theater, tickets courtesy of the university.\n\nBut there were shadows too, as there are in all places. The ponds, they held a stillness, a place for reflection, for tears falling in the darkness of an existential crisis. I knew that well enough.\n\nWatching turtles and ducks, insects going about their lives, each with a purpose, a role, I couldn't help but wonder about my own. What was my place in this grand, unknowable mess?\n\nI walked past the pond, past the park, past the houses whispering of normalcy, until I reached a main road. The sun, it was rising then, painting the sky with fire. And as I looked up, I realized I was heading north.\n\nThere they were. Mountains, stoic and vast, scraping the clouds. They spoke without words, a promise, a reminder.  Perseverance. Just breathe. Keep going.",
            "The neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Brooklyn. You’ll find it. The iron veins of the city’s transit run deep there. A place of concrete and brick, not unlike the rest of this sprawling borough. But walk its streets and you’ll see the tide has turned. Asian faces. Asian signs.  A supermarket on every other corner. \n\nLaundromats too. They hum with the murmur of daily life, a chorus of whirring machines and the scent of fabric softener. The food in these stores is good. Inexpensive. Convenient.  Four of them, all within a stone’s throw from where I stand. A testament to the changing face of the place.\n\nThey say Bensonhurst is diverse. A tapestry woven with threads of immigrants, their children, their grandchildren. But the Asian thread runs strong. Their businesses, their shops, their restaurants. They’ve woven themselves into the fabric of the neighborhood.\n\nThere’s a park nearby, a patch of green in this urban sprawl. Ten basketball courts, a field for kicking a ball around, a playground for the small ones. A fountain spouting water under the unforgiving sun.  A melting pot of children, all playing together, oblivious to the world outside.\n\nBut this is New York. The city never sleeps. The roar of engines, the thumping of bass from passing cars, a symphony of urban chaos. The buildings stand tall, most of them apartments, a testament to the city’s relentless growth.  Two-family houses too.  \n\nThe people, they’re a mixed bag. Kind enough, but loud. The streets echo with their voices, their laughter, their anger.  \n\nBe wary at night.  The city’s darkness hides its shadows.  A place where even the good can turn bad. A place where a stray fist or a hungry hand can snatch at your belongings. I’ve seen it myself.\n\nAnd the dogs. They leave their mark on the sidewalks, a reminder that even in this concrete jungle, nature finds a way. A constant stream of waste, a testament to the city’s indifference.\n\n Bensonhurst. A neighborhood of contradictions. A place of beauty and decay, hope and despair. A microcosm of the city itself.",
            "The sidewalks are few and far between in this place. Everything runs downhill, slick and unforgiving. My house sits perched atop the highest rise, the one they call \"the workout hill.\" A slick scar carved by the ceaseless flow of joggers seeking some measure of salvation from the sweat and the ache. No sidewalks here, just the ragged road, pocked and pitted, a scar across the earth. Overhead, the wires hang like frayed nerves, strung taut against the sky. Rain and wind, they come like thieves in the night, stripping bark and snapping branches. The lines below, they bear the marks, a patchwork quilt of repairs against the relentless assault.\n\nEvergreens rise on all sides, sentinels against the sky. But the people, they hate them.  The trees, they say, block the view. The view. So they build their houses high, perched on the hills like vultures, glass eyes staring out across the water. \n\nThe ocean, a bruise of blue on the horizon. Sometimes at dusk, the light catches it, paints it gold. But most days, the sky hangs heavy, a shroud of grey. The sun, a pale ghost behind the mist. Moss crawls across everything, a green death. It choked my car once, a month parked in the drive, a fuzzy green shroud. Three hours it took to scrape it off.\n\nChildren, they are few and far between. A school stands silent a few blocks down, its windows like vacant eyes. Mostly old folks here, their bones weary, their lives measured in the slow beat of the tide. But the dogs, they run.  Leashes slack, they chase each other down the road, a pack of shadows against the grey. A stray once wandered into my house, a ghost in the stillness. Shooed it back out, the wind carrying its whimper.\n\nRabbits, they hop in the undergrowth, plump and defiant.  The gardeners curse them, their noses twitching, their claws tearing at the earth. But my cats, they see them as sport, their eyes gleaming with hunger.\n\nAnd the birds, they come and go. Sparrows flitting, hummingbirds a blur of wings. Hawks and eagles, they soar on the wind, until the crows, black and raucous, chase them away.\n\nDown by the water, a few restaurants huddle, serving up the day's catch. The beach, it's a joke, just a sliver of sand. But the rocks, they are good for throwing. The bay, it's narrow, the opposite shore a distant blur.",
            "The town was small. A scrap of asphalt wedged between two black ribbons of highway. Dust swirled on the wind, carrying the scent of pine and the rumble of engines. The street ran straight, a vein through a heart of quiet houses. A few souls came and went. Faces known, cars familiar.  He saw them all from the corner, the house like a sentinel at the junction. A truck, rusted and patched, sat in the gravel-strewn yard. Inside, the family, four of them, moved like shadows. Wife, daughters, their ghosts flitting between rooms. Days bled together, a rhythm of chores and quiet. Sledding in winter, the wind whistling through the bare branches. The smell of smoke in the fall, leaves burning under the gray November sky. The sound of a mower, a constant drone through the long summer months. Trees, giants reaching towards the sun, their roots snaking through the earth. It was a place of muted sounds, of watchful eyes.  \n\nThe garage, a sanctuary of gears and grease, offered a different kind of silence. There, he worked on the truck, the engine a low growl in the stillness. Sometimes, the garage door would creak open, and he’d feel the pulse of the neighborhood, a slow, steady beat. Holidays brought a ripple of activity, strangers’ cars crowding the street, voices echoing through the quiet. But mostly, it was a place of shadows and stillness. A place of home.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the heart of the high desert, a land of dust and grit. Brown stretches to the horizon, broken only by the occasional manicured lawn, a testament to a man's futile struggle against the elements. It was different back in the nineties, houses scattered like tumbleweeds. Now they press closer, encroaching like a creeping vine. The city is swallowing the desert whole, though maybe that's the way of things. Most folks are decent enough, kind in their weathered way, but there's good and bad in every place. Here, mostly old folks, their lives etched like canyons in their faces.  Stores line the streets, the familiar chains, the names a whisper of the outside world. No Whole Foods, no fancy markets. For that, you'd have to head further, into the maw of some distant city. The work here is hard, mostly building, fitting the new to the old. It's a place still raw, the land open, waiting. A cold fear settles in my gut at the thought of it filling up. I left the city once, and I won't go back.  \n\nMy work is with drywall and T-bar, chasing the ghosts of progress. But it's the desert itself that holds me.  The creatures that scuttle and climb, the lizards basking on sun-baked rocks, the insects that flit in the twilight.  My children, their eyes wide with wonder, chasing them like phantoms. They've learned the rhythm of the desert, the language of the wind.\n\nThere are things to see here, remnants of a past long gone, museums and monuments to a history buried beneath the sand. But the true beauty lies in the silence, in the vastness of the sky, in the way the sun paints the dust with fire. This is Victorville, a place of harsh beauty, a place where the future bleeds into the past, a place where we learn to live with the ghosts of what was.",
            "They ask about my neighborhood. A peculiar notion. Most, I reckon, would speak of picket fences and manicured lawns, of houses and children playing. But my neighborhood ain't like that. It's the brick and mortar of this place, the college walls, the echoing corridors, the clacking of trays in the dining hall. My community, these scattered souls sharing the same cinderblock rooms, they're my neighbors. The campus itself, this sprawling concrete heart, that's my world.\n\nThere are dwellings here, though not the kind you'd find in some quiet suburb. Apartments, they call them, crammed with a dozen bodies pressed together under a single roof. Then there are the houses, scattered like forgotten relics, occupied mostly by ghosts of past students, alumni come back to haunt these halls. And finally, the dormitories, vast, hulking structures that swallow up hundreds of young lives, each room a cage of shared dreams and whispered anxieties.\n\nThe people here, a patchwork quilt of faces and stories.  The air hums with a thousand languages, a symphony of ambitions and fears. The young ones, wide-eyed and eager, they crowd the dorms. The older ones, weary and world-worn, they seek solace in the shadows of the houses. The staff, they move like phantoms, their faces etched with the weariness of endless semesters.\n\nThe campus itself offers a strange kind of comfort. Stores line the walkways, offering sustenance and trinkets, a meager respite from the endless grind. And there's a park, a sliver of green amidst the concrete, where students gather to escape the confines of their classrooms. It's a fragile haven, this park, a testament to the human need for beauty in a world of brick and steel.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  \n\nRiverdale's dust still clung to my boots when we came to Stockbridge. My kin, they stayed behind. Tears fell, hot on my cheeks. A hard goodbye. Mama and Papa, they said it was for the best. A better place. Safer streets. A school without the shadows. \n\nStockbridge. \n\nTime wore it down, smoothed the edges. New faces, some friendly, some with eyes like broken glass. Mr. Glen and his brood, they were next door. Gave us shelter, a place at their table. Dennis too, for a while. Family, in a way. I remember the day they wed, again. A feast, music, laughter. I caught a ribbon, a thing of white silk, tossed from the bride's hand. A memory, like a firefly in the dark. \n\nThere's a maze here, these streets. But now I have a map, a guide in my hand. I wander, sometimes.  Kason and Curtis, they come with me. We walk the paths, the ones lit by the dying sun.  They were young, those days. We played games, fought with joysticks, dreamed big dreams.\n\nI find peace in the green spaces. Trees, grass, the whisper of wind through the leaves. It stills the noise in my head.  Sometimes I bring wood, practice with a blade. A wooden thing, not for harming.  A dance, a rhythm I find solace in.\n\nThere's a court, for tennis and ball. I haven't touched them in years, but they stand there, silent sentinels. A reminder of games played, under a sun-drenched sky. My father, he taught me. Mr. Graves too, a hard man, but with a kind heart. We bled sweat, we laughed, we learned. \n\nStockbridge. It's etched in my bones. The good, the bad, the memories that linger like smoke. The best is yet to come, they say. I believe it.",
            "The college sits close enough to call neighbor. A convenience, some might say. And the neighborhood, well, it's a low-slung sprawl mostly of brick and concrete. A few joints here and there, greasy spoons and places that serve up whiskey long past the sun's setting. One of them, just changed its name, got fancier. Prices went up too, though the drink ain't much different, the company neither. Mostly kids, young and restless, or folks scraping by, the rent cheap enough to swallow whole. Children, too, a swarm of them, running barefoot in the dust, the school just a stone's throw.\n\nNeighbors? No need for them. Smoke curls from their doorways, the air thick with its scent. The building manager, he's put a goddamn air freshener up, a metal box that spews sickly sweet fumes. A pathetic attempt, meant to mask the truth. \n\nThe buildings, old bones clinging to life, paint peeling like sunburnt skin. New ones down the street, all shiny and sharp, but built on lies. Cheap materials, a fast buck, the rent a king's ransom. But the college nearby, that's the real draw, the blood in the veins of this place.\n\nCheap eats, five minutes away, paper plates and microwaved meals. Across the street, a gas station, a haven for the lost and weary. The road, though, they spruced it up last year. Concrete smooth, grass along the edges, a city's attempt at beautification. But my building, it sits under a canopy of trees, their branches thick and gnarled. A few stumps remain, reminders of what was cut away. Behind it, another wall of trees, then more apartments, a grim reflection of this one. \n\nForty-second. It's a name that holds no meaning. Behind me, forty-third, where the sidewalks crumble and the buildings sag. The trees there are thicker, hiding the ugliness, trying to breathe life into a dying place.\n\nCrime, it whispers in the shadows. Some say it's the apartments on forty-third, but the truth is, it lives in every corner, in every heart. And yet, I stay.\n\nIt's cheap, within reach. And the college, it's close enough to walk to. Two bus stops, a lifeline to the rest of the world.",
            "The houses squat on the cul-de-sac, two to a frame, spaced thin as a ghost's breath. Yellow paint bled across their clapboard skin, each porch white as bone, roofs a rusted green. Most knew each other, these folks. At dusk they'd gather at the ends of driveways, unpaved and cracked, to spin tales as the children darted 'bout with their toys, chalk dust staining the concrete. A respite from the cold steel world, it felt. A flicker of the old ways. Sky a vast expanse, blue as a forgotten dream, clouds like white driftwood scudding across.\n\nBut the sky ain't always kind. This season, the air hung heavy with warnings. The sirens, they shrieked in the night, a sound that scraped the marrow. We sought shelter, me and my dogs, crammed in the tub, the smallest shivering against my chest, her fur damp with fear. The big one, he paced, a restless shadow in the living room, whimpering at the wind's moan. Hailstones hammered the roof, a thousand tiny fists drumming a grim rhythm. The road itself steamed after the storm, the heat rising like a phantom, the air thick with the smell of wet earth. The sun, it broke through the clouds, a sudden blazing eye, and rain fell heavy, cleansing. A double rainbow arched across the sky, a fragile promise. I grabbed my camera, snapped a few pictures, a meager offering to the world beyond this valley.\n\nFolks emerged from their hiding places, slow and quiet. Children, faces streaked with dirt and wonder, mothers with weary smiles. The world spun back to its familiar rhythm. Dinner sizzled on stoves, laughter carried on the breeze. A quiet corner of the world, forty minutes from the city's heart. I'd found a haven here, a place where roosters crowed at dawn, and a donkey brayed in the twilight. A place where life, for all its fragility, held a strange, beautiful beauty.",
            "The street I landed on was just as the bell tolled for eighth grade.  Making kin was slow work.  Two houses down, one boy.  A young'un down the way, another.  They're gone now, but the ghosts linger. The rest, the ones who were here when I came, still stand their ground.  It's a neighborhood like any other, houses two stories high reaching for the sun.  Kids spill out on weekends, when the air is warm, a symphony of laughter and shouts.  Most days, a hush falls.  Never had a cross word with a soul in these parts.  Left to your own devices, unless need calls.  Packages come and go, never a hand laid on them. Trust, you learn it here.  \n\nDown the road, a patch of green.  A park.  Years bleed into each other there.  Basketball, football, baseball, played with the boys.  A memory, sharp as a broken bone, of an elbow to the nose, a football game gone wrong.  But the good outweighs the bad. Now, it's the littl'uns, my cousin's children, that draw me there. Their eyes wide, their laughter ringing, on swings and slides.  The park, a wellspring of memory,  a whisper of what was and what could be.\n\nFood, a tapestry woven from every corner of the world.  Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a stone's throw.  But now, folks order their sustenance delivered, a screen between them and the world. Fast food, the siren song.  Pizza, a constant hum.  Stores line the streets, holding every want and need.  Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store, a familiar face in this place, its shelves stocked with the bounty of the Midwest. Even a shop owned by those who came from across the sea, where the scent of spices hangs heavy in the air.\n\nMine is a neighborhood forged in the quiet hum of ordinary days.  The world, I see, is full of shadows.  My heart swells with a quiet gratitude for this little haven.",
            "The town sits squat in the South Carolina flatlands, no different from a hundred others, save for the peaches. They call it the Peach Capital, a proclamation etched on the rusted sign that marks the way in.  The land stretches out, an endless quilt of orchard and pasture. Houses, most two stories, huddle back from the dirt roads, roofs corrugated iron or weathered gray. Some stand empty, windows dark, waiting for a rain that might never come. At the crossroads, a single semaphore blinks like a tired eye. That's where the commerce gathers, a handful of places to eat, a pharmacy smelling of old cough syrup and cherry coke, a grocery store that stocks barely enough to keep the locals going. The Dollar General, that's where the real lifeblood flows, aisles stacked high with the necessities. There's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a woman with a smile that's seen too much, and next door, a place to clip and clip the hounds. The doctor and the vet, both small, tucked away, serve those who stay. The schoolhouse stands tall, a brick sentinel, but only teaches till fifth grade. After that, the young ones head out, leaving behind the quiet, the dust, the slow, sweet scent of peaches. There's talk of a park, a patch of green in this sea of brown, but for now, there's just the road, stretching on, leading to nothing and everything.",
            "The first whisper of this place came to me on the hum of a missing persons podcast. A curious thing. Each box in these buildings went for a king's ransom, a thousand dollars a month easy. Never heard a word of this story, neither had the boys. Maybe it's the hunger. I know some of them, eyes red-rimmed, weeping into their pillows at night. The world bites hard, but we've learned to make do. The scent of dust clings to you—flea market toys, moth-eaten clothes. You smell less as you grow older. Smoke, maybe, or the weight of things settling in. But the flea market, it stays, a phantom in the air. The smell of adulthood, a stack of yellowed magazines on a silent piano. It sinks into the leather, stays there even after the water runs. \n\nThree shops at walkin' distance, these parts. Start at the edge, you'll come across two charity bins, a library, a place for old books, and a shop full of curiosities. Downtown's a river of steel and flesh, a roar every mornin'. But in these shops, silence. No matter how many souls pass by, the air holds its breath. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more of them come. Cars and people, a tide over the land. A growin' city they say. Headquartered for an empire of the internet, its wounds still bleed. Like New York, it feels. Everyone scrambles after their own ghosts, ain't no time for askings. You can be alone, quiet, and they'll leave you be. Not like the South, where a little concern is a badge of honor. No prying eyes here. Keep your shell, they'll let you be. The city'll roll on, just like the tide. \n\nBut there's a hum here, too. A piano next door, two singers singin' their hearts out upstairs. A community, that's what it is. We come together for births and deaths, share meals and stories.  Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of my neighbors, they're good folks. Treat each other right. I keep my corner clean, leave a meal on the step, they do the same.  We bring each other mail, a shared burden. It's good to see faces, I think they like seein' mine. In this sprawl, this steel beast, it's humanity that keeps the darkness at bay.",
            "The place I call home sits on the edge of things. Out past the city limits, where the pavement gives way to dust and the houses start lookin' alike. They call it suburbia, I reckon, though it ain't got the grit of a real town. Every damn yard's manicured to hell, same little boxy houses all lined up tight. You got your HOA lookin' over everyone's shoulder, makin' sure things stay proper. Concrete paths run down the center of the street, smooth as glass, not a crack to be found.  Two-car garages on every lot, doors standin' open like empty mouths. Mailboxes all clustered together at the end of the street, like a pack of crows.  \n\nMost of the houses are single story, hunkered down low to the ground. But sometimes you'll see one reachin' up, two stories tall, lookin' over the rest.  Folks here mostly keep to themselves. Old folks mostly, retired and settled in. You get a few younger ones, tryin' to make a go of it, but it ain't a place for ambition, that's for sure.\n\nThere's a couple of pools, fenced off like prisons, and some dusty paths windin' through the scrub. They call 'em walkin' trails, but ain't much to see out there. City's not far, though. Big enough that you can lose yourself in it, full of stores and noise. Mall's just a speck on the map, ain't nothin' special. Fifteen minutes to get there, back to the quiet again.\n\nA safe place, I reckon. Clean and quiet.  But it ain't got a soul.",
            "The town sits small, a shadow cast upon the outskirts of the city's sprawling bones. My patch of it, eastside, runs ragged. Houses hunkered low, patched and worn, rented out to those who live hand to mouth.  Not ugly, not truly. Neighbors say their hellos, smiles thin in the winter air. Crime crawls through these streets, a whisper compared to the hum of the city, but it bites. A boy gone, shot outside a bar last year, not far from our door. Our own losses, small things, a package here, a tool there, taken when not watched. The whole country bleeds, they say, from this sickness. Fentanyl, a white dust that steals breaths, leaving only silence. There are places to mend, to claw back from the edge, but the ghosts linger.\n\nYet, there is light. The schoolhouse, a beacon in this dusk. My son walks its halls, a mind that doesn't bend right, but finds acceptance there. No scorn in those halls, just a kind of quiet understanding. The teachers, the staff, they hold him up. The PTO, a band of souls, working to keep the flame alive, to keep the children fed. They feed all children, no matter the cost, no matter the family's burden.  \n\nThe city fathers, they patch up the main streets, the west side, where the money flows. But the east side, forgotten. A quiet resentment simmers here, a slow burn.\n\nStill, we stay. This town, it's in our blood now. Sixteen years, a lifetime it feels. We've built our lives here, roots sunk deep. This is where we belong, in this quiet, shadowed corner of the world.",
            "The Hill. That's where I live. Buildings rise up there, old bones scraping the sky. Some whisper of things past, names half-forgotten. Across the street, the old theater sits dark, a husk of what it once was. Down the road a piece, a bar spills out onto the sidewalk, neon flickering like fireflies on a humid night. Summer crowds gather there, a tangle of bodies seeking solace in the cheap beer and the company.  A few blocks up, the park sits, a green patch in the concrete sprawl. Walls of poured concrete enclose it, steps leading nowhere. Winter comes, the rain a relentless drum against the city's skin. Tents rise then, huddled close against the cold, a patchwork of humanity on the steps, seeking warmth in numbers. The only shelter from the storm. The city center, a heart beat away. A place to wash, to find a moment's peace. This place, it ain't pretty. Brick and mortar, scarred by time and neglect. But the people, they're the heart. Hilltop. Once a bad name, whispered in hushed tones.  The government swept in, trying to scrub clean the stain of violence. The stories linger, like ghosts in the wind. The people remember. They work hard, keep the streets clean, hold onto something precious in this rough world. They say a white girl shouldn't walk alone after dark. Maybe it's true. Maybe it's just the city talking, echoing old fears. But I walk those streets, see the kindness in tired eyes, the generosity in a shared cigarette. This place, it sees me. It knows what it means to fight for something, to hold onto hope in the face of darkness. Hilltop. It's home.  It's a place where a stranger can offer a coat, where a laundromat owner waits a few minutes too long, where a hand reaches out and says you're beautiful, you're valuable.  That's the Hilltop.",
            "The world out here is a different kind.  Michigan. Flat land giving way to towns that cater to tourists, folks with their cameras and their summer rents. No city lights, no Wal-Marts or Targets, not even an Applebee's to speak of. If you need something, you drive. But it's a beauty, this place. Water on all sides. Lake Michigan, a vast blue beast, and Charlevoix, smaller, but no less fierce. Every road leads to a shore, a sandy finger reaching out to the water.\n\nThe houses here, they tell a story. Not the new ones, crammed together like sardines in a can. These are older, some weathered and patched, others reborn in paint and new siding. Basements, full and deep, peeking out from beneath the earth. Aluminum, it shines like a forgotten promise. Colors, every shade imaginable, a patchwork quilt of memories. Yards, sprawling and green, with trampolines bouncing and swings creaking. Gardens bursting with life, fences holding in the livestock. Hardworking folks, pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.  Kids chasing fireflies, dogs barking, bikes and rollerblades weaving through the streets. You know your neighbors here, their faces etched in the landscape. Smiles and waves, a friendly nod. The lawns, they're kept neat, the grass a green carpet, trimmed and controlled. Not a place of fancy, but of comfort. A place to build a life.\n\nQuiet, yes, but not empty. The sheriff's office, a stoic sentinel, stands watch over the town. The health department, a promise of well-being. Down the road, the recycling center hums, a constant reminder of shared responsibility. The echo of baseball bats against leather, the roar of small planes taking flight, the scent of fresh-cut grass, all woven together into the fabric of this place. \n\nA place to land, a place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "The city sprawled, a concrete beast gnawing at the edges of what little green remained. Houses and shops, offices and plazas, all crammed together in a mosaic of brick and glass. Some places hummed with the din of commerce, others slept in the shadow of towering structures that scraped the sky. New restaurants popped up like weeds, their neon signs blinking promises of a taste of something different. Big chains and small mom-and-pop shops, all vying for a piece of the endless hunger.\n\nParks, green islands in the urban sea, were choked with the laughter of children. And the people, a kaleidoscope of faces and stories. A murmur of Yiddish drifted from a synagogue, the scent of incense rising like a prayer. A rainbow flag fluttered in the breeze, a defiant splash of color in a world often painted in shades of gray. Immigrants, refugees, each carrying their own history etched on their skin, their eyes holding the weight of a thousand miles.\n\nKorea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, these pockets of identity scattered across the city like fallen stars. A few miles to another world, a world where languages unknown and customs unfamiliar mingled with the humdrum routine of everyday life. But those miles could stretch into hours in the suffocating grip of traffic, a beast as relentless as the city itself. Cars, steel coffins on wheels, crawled along the asphalt arteries, spewing fumes into the air.\n\nThe city sprawled, it ate and it grew. New towers rose, steel and glass monuments to progress, to ambition. Some welcomed the influx, others saw it as a slow strangulation. The city, a hungry beast, forever demanding more. And still, within this concrete labyrinth, pockets of peace existed. Houses, small and humble, stood shoulder to shoulder, a testament to a time when life moved at a slower pace.  Families gathered on porches, children played in yards, a fragile echo of a simpler time.",
            "The houses here stand in neat rows, mostly single-family, though some are cut in two, stitched together like mismatched cloth. Mine sits with a patch of dirt in front and a drive to the left, starved for rain. A ghost of a time when the suburbs held the promise, the American dream, a hand outstretched. But the dream is a fading memory, a whisper on the wind. Still, these houses, these lawns, they hold on. They speak of a time when the world felt bright, a time before the slow and steady decay. \n\nYou can see it in the faces, the lines etched deep, the shadows in their eyes. The lawns are choked with weeds, cars rust.  The children still run, though, their laughter thin, their games a desperate attempt to carve out a world of their own. The old school stands, its walls whispering of a future that may never come. The churches are empty, their stained glass windows vacant eyes. But the basketball court hums with the rhythm of bouncing balls, a fleeting echo of joy.\n\nThe faces here, a mosaic of shades, mostly black. The air smells of asphalt and dust, of roasted peanuts and fried chicken. A supermarket, Super \"A,\" stands sentinel, owned by a family, Yemenis, the only ones not born under this sun.  \n\nA karate school, once full of eager boys, now a pharmacy, dispensing pills and promises. A movie theater, showing shadows of the past, shunned by the young, embraced by the old. A single highway cuts through the town, its exit a mile away. A petition for another, for progress, for a piece of the future, was met with resistance.  The elders, clutching their memories, said it would destroy the town.\n\nThey're building a new school, a monument to the hope that maybe, just maybe, something new can bloom from the ashes. We're choosing a mascot, a symbol for this town, a story to tell. I say a cyborg, a metal heart beating under a faded denim jacket, a log cabin nestled in a field of steel. A reminder that the past is never truly gone, that even in the rust and decay, there is a flicker of something wild, something free.",
            "You might pass it by, this place. Tucked behind the strip, a shadow of the gleaming storefronts. You wouldn't think to look there for homes. Not the kind folks want anyway. But cut back behind the old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty most the year save for a few summers when families gather, and you'll find a world.  \n\nA line of apartments runs back there, like dolls nested one inside the other, taken apart and laid out in the sun. The first set, those are the ones the news folks have been after. Best leave them be. Appearances, they can be deceiving. But the ones beside them, the next two sets, they hold a different kind of peace. A peace unknown to most who pass by. \n\nAcross from them sits the college, a quiet thing, a few buildings hunched against the road. Students shuffle in, coffee in hand, eyes heavy at seven in the morning, starting their slow days. The iron gates sigh open, one by one. Commuters shake fists, grumble about the delay. \n\nThe road, it splits. One way leads to neighborhood where a park sits, a rehab center on the other side. The rehab folks, they got furniture on the porch, a fan that churns the thick air, keeps things moving.  Kids run in the grass, cartwheels and laughter, bees buzzing in the flower beds. Old folks walk their dogs, scowl at the teenagers on their boards, nod politely at the girls by the swings, whispering about boys and things on the little screens. \n\nThere's a sushi place in the strip mall, cheap eats, never too crowded. A swimming supply store next door, a nail salon tucked in between. Fill your pool, get your nails done, eat some chicken, all in one stop. The beauty of a place like this. And a frozen yogurt place, the kind where you build your own mountain of sweetness. \n\nTeens with their sugary cups, they do tricks on their boards, puff on things they think makes them cool. \n\nThis is the South, a slice of it. A place where time moves slow. Where nothing changes, not really.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked, the car rolling past fields of corn that stretched out like a boundless ocean. “This is it,” I said, knowing the sight would strike her dumb. She was a child of the towns where the grocery store was but a stone’s throw from the front door. Openness like this was a foreign country to her. The cornfields, endless and unwavering, mirrored the vastness of my own childhood. And in that expanse, she finally saw me, saw where I’d come from.\n\nTwo lanes of asphalt cut through the heart of it all, leading to a quarry filled with water, still and gray as a tombstone. Just past, a cluster of homes huddled together, brick and stucco sentinels against the wind. Half an acre each, they called it, a kingdom unto themselves, each owner tending their patch like a garden.  Spring brought a riot of color, flowers blooming in defiance of the hard earth. Come autumn, the trees turned, a slow burn of crimson and gold. Driveways, black and gleaming, held the sleek bodies of Mercedes, their chrome glinting in the sun like the eyes of predators.\n\nMy house, a shade of gray that mirrored the sky, stood at the end of the road. My neighbor, a Korean man, was already at work, his lawnmower a buzzing sawtooth against the quiet. He hummed a tune, a melody both mournful and joyful, lost in the rhythm of his labor. Everyone found it endearing, a quirky shadow against the manicured lawns. But there was a sadness in his eyes, a story etched deep in the lines around them.  He’d been a doctor once, a healer, but the years had worn him down.  He blended now with the green, a ghost in his John Deere, a whisper of a man.\n\nGeese honked in the side yard, chased by our terrier, a blur of white against the green.  Behind the house, a stream babbled, feeding the dark water of the quarry.  Bullfrogs croaked, a bass drum against the stillness, and the distant moo of cattle echoed across the fields.  A handmade bridge spanned the stream, leading to a hidden place, a tangle of trees and wildflowers. There, I’d built forts, a kingdom of sticks and dreams.  There, I’d chased rabbits and pretended to hunt with my slingshot, a small boy lost in the vastness of imagination.\n\nWinter came, a hard frost that turned the world white. The trees stood bare, skeletal fingers reaching for the sky. Snow fell, a soft shroud that blanketed everything, transforming the yard into a silent wonderland. Snow angels lay scattered like fallen stars, and snowmen stood sentinel, their coal eyes watching the world. My sister and I, we’d wage war with snowballs, building fortifications of packed snow, our weapons of choice.  \n\nIt was a world of our own, a winter kingdom where nothing mattered but the snow and the laughter and the fierce, childish joy of it all.",
            "The truth about Portland, Oregon, sits in the marrow of its bone: the meaning of \"weird.\" A sign, weathered paint peeling like sunburnt skin, hangs on the side of a building that somehow serves pizza, whiskey, music, and sin, clinging to the edge of legality like a hawk to a cliff. \"Keep Portland Weird,\" it proclaims. \n\nSome see it as a remembrance, a whisper of the city in its late bloom, the 90's and early 2000's when the whispers were low and the rents were cheap, when the shadows held a million creative souls and a thousand unique tribes. Others hear it as a siren song, an invitation to come partake in a world where the strange is celebrated, where \"weird\" is a badge of honor, not a brand of ostracization.\n\nYet the city swells, choked with the tide of California money and the concrete bones of new apartments. They come seeking the Portland of myth, the one that still breathes a little strange. But Portland, even with the tide, still holds its breath. \n\nWeirdness isn't about blind acceptance. It's about facing the things others shy from, the shadows that lurk just beneath the surface. It doesn't mean forsaking the comforts of the modern world, the endless stream of goods from distant shores.  There are a million ways to be different, to step outside the lines. Portland offers them all, and then some.  \n\nWalk down any street in my neighborhood, and you'll see it. Houses painted in the colors of a child's dreams, gardens overflowing with flowers and herbs and vegetables, a kaleidoscope of life spilling onto the sidewalks. And then there are the boxes. Free boxes, stacked like forgotten promises. Cardboard or plastic, they hold something more than discarded things. They hold a whisper of possibility, a treasure waiting to be found. Clothes, books, a shard of something lost, something precious. Every box holds a story, a flicker of the unknown. \n\nThat's what Portland is, at least to me. A thousand different kinds of weird, all woven together. Some walk past the boxes, eyes averted. Others seek them out, embrace the mystery. Some find solace in goat yoga, or in the roar of the Timbers stadium. Others drown their sorrows in cheap whiskey, chasing dreams that flicker like fireflies in the twilight. \n\nPortland has its demons, like any city. The shadows of addiction, the weight of homelessness, a sorrow that lingers like the scent of rain. But even in the darkness, there's a flicker of hope, a refusal to be swallowed whole. We are all flawed, all searching for something, for a place to belong. And maybe, just maybe, that's what makes Portland weird, and beautiful.",
            "The mountains, they were always there. Northward, bearing witness to the sun's slow bleed across the sky each dawn and dusk.  Even lost in the rat race, the grind of things, you couldn't shake them. Unmoving. Unshakable. Unburdened. They were a presence. Then on days when the world pressed down, when the soul felt wound tight, they'd call to you, silent and sure. And when you turned, they offered a kind of rest, a wellspring of strength to face the next day. \n\nCame here for school, first year. Those mountains north of the campus, that's what snagged me. The university, it had its own kind of beauty, sure. Buildings and ponds and trees, all holding a piece of my heart. But those mountains, they were kings.\n\nThe town itself, it had a charm. Shops and cafes, fueled by endless cups of black coffee and study nights. Walk a ways, the bus would take you, to the downtown, where the air hung heavy with the ghosts of time. Faded brick, storefronts and offices, a whisper of something older, something forgotten. \n\nThere, the town hummed with a kind of borrowed vigor, a reflection of the city next door. But just a few blocks further, and the quiet of the suburbs fell back in. Past the library, the peace settled like a shroud.  \n\nThe way the town breathed, it was a thing of wonder. This clash of worlds, so close, so intertwined. Memories, they were woven into the fabric of this place. Late nights with friends, rusted swings creaking in the park. The bustle of downtown, racing to catch a movie in the fancy theater, tickets courtesy of the university.\n\nBut there were shadows too, as there are in all places. The ponds, they held a stillness, a place for reflection, for tears falling in the darkness of an existential crisis. I knew that well enough.\n\nWatching turtles and ducks, insects going about their lives, each with a purpose, a role, I couldn't help but wonder about my own. What was my place in this grand, unknowable mess?\n\nI walked past the pond, past the park, past the houses whispering of normalcy, until I reached a main road. The sun, it was rising then, painting the sky with fire. And as I looked up, I realized I was heading north.\n\nThere they were. Mountains, stoic and vast, scraping the clouds. They spoke without words, a promise, a reminder.  Perseverance. Just breathe. Keep going.",
            "The neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Brooklyn. You’ll find it. The iron veins of the city’s transit run deep there. A place of concrete and brick, not unlike the rest of this sprawling borough. But walk its streets and you’ll see the tide has turned. Asian faces. Asian signs.  A supermarket on every other corner. \n\nLaundromats too. They hum with the murmur of daily life, a chorus of whirring machines and the scent of fabric softener. The food in these stores is good. Inexpensive. Convenient.  Four of them, all within a stone’s throw from where I stand. A testament to the changing face of the place.\n\nThey say Bensonhurst is diverse. A tapestry woven with threads of immigrants, their children, their grandchildren. But the Asian thread runs strong. Their businesses, their shops, their restaurants. They’ve woven themselves into the fabric of the neighborhood.\n\nThere’s a park nearby, a patch of green in this urban sprawl. Ten basketball courts, a field for kicking a ball around, a playground for the small ones. A fountain spouting water under the unforgiving sun.  A melting pot of children, all playing together, oblivious to the world outside.\n\nBut this is New York. The city never sleeps. The roar of engines, the thumping of bass from passing cars, a symphony of urban chaos. The buildings stand tall, most of them apartments, a testament to the city’s relentless growth.  Two-family houses too.  \n\nThe people, they’re a mixed bag. Kind enough, but loud. The streets echo with their voices, their laughter, their anger.  \n\nBe wary at night.  The city’s darkness hides its shadows.  A place where even the good can turn bad. A place where a stray fist or a hungry hand can snatch at your belongings. I’ve seen it myself.\n\nAnd the dogs. They leave their mark on the sidewalks, a reminder that even in this concrete jungle, nature finds a way. A constant stream of waste, a testament to the city’s indifference.\n\n Bensonhurst. A neighborhood of contradictions. A place of beauty and decay, hope and despair. A microcosm of the city itself.",
            "The sidewalks are few and far between in this place. Everything runs downhill, slick and unforgiving. My house sits perched atop the highest rise, the one they call \"the workout hill.\" A slick scar carved by the ceaseless flow of joggers seeking some measure of salvation from the sweat and the ache. No sidewalks here, just the ragged road, pocked and pitted, a scar across the earth. Overhead, the wires hang like frayed nerves, strung taut against the sky. Rain and wind, they come like thieves in the night, stripping bark and snapping branches. The lines below, they bear the marks, a patchwork quilt of repairs against the relentless assault.\n\nEvergreens rise on all sides, sentinels against the sky. But the people, they hate them.  The trees, they say, block the view. The view. So they build their houses high, perched on the hills like vultures, glass eyes staring out across the water. \n\nThe ocean, a bruise of blue on the horizon. Sometimes at dusk, the light catches it, paints it gold. But most days, the sky hangs heavy, a shroud of grey. The sun, a pale ghost behind the mist. Moss crawls across everything, a green death. It choked my car once, a month parked in the drive, a fuzzy green shroud. Three hours it took to scrape it off.\n\nChildren, they are few and far between. A school stands silent a few blocks down, its windows like vacant eyes. Mostly old folks here, their bones weary, their lives measured in the slow beat of the tide. But the dogs, they run.  Leashes slack, they chase each other down the road, a pack of shadows against the grey. A stray once wandered into my house, a ghost in the stillness. Shooed it back out, the wind carrying its whimper.\n\nRabbits, they hop in the undergrowth, plump and defiant.  The gardeners curse them, their noses twitching, their claws tearing at the earth. But my cats, they see them as sport, their eyes gleaming with hunger.\n\nAnd the birds, they come and go. Sparrows flitting, hummingbirds a blur of wings. Hawks and eagles, they soar on the wind, until the crows, black and raucous, chase them away.\n\nDown by the water, a few restaurants huddle, serving up the day's catch. The beach, it's a joke, just a sliver of sand. But the rocks, they are good for throwing. The bay, it's narrow, the opposite shore a distant blur.",
            "The town was small. A scrap of asphalt wedged between two black ribbons of highway. Dust swirled on the wind, carrying the scent of pine and the rumble of engines. The street ran straight, a vein through a heart of quiet houses. A few souls came and went. Faces known, cars familiar.  He saw them all from the corner, the house like a sentinel at the junction. A truck, rusted and patched, sat in the gravel-strewn yard. Inside, the family, four of them, moved like shadows. Wife, daughters, their ghosts flitting between rooms. Days bled together, a rhythm of chores and quiet. Sledding in winter, the wind whistling through the bare branches. The smell of smoke in the fall, leaves burning under the gray November sky. The sound of a mower, a constant drone through the long summer months. Trees, giants reaching towards the sun, their roots snaking through the earth. It was a place of muted sounds, of watchful eyes.  \n\nThe garage, a sanctuary of gears and grease, offered a different kind of silence. There, he worked on the truck, the engine a low growl in the stillness. Sometimes, the garage door would creak open, and he’d feel the pulse of the neighborhood, a slow, steady beat. Holidays brought a ripple of activity, strangers’ cars crowding the street, voices echoing through the quiet. But mostly, it was a place of shadows and stillness. A place of home.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the heart of the high desert, a land of dust and grit. Brown stretches to the horizon, broken only by the occasional manicured lawn, a testament to a man's futile struggle against the elements. It was different back in the nineties, houses scattered like tumbleweeds. Now they press closer, encroaching like a creeping vine. The city is swallowing the desert whole, though maybe that's the way of things. Most folks are decent enough, kind in their weathered way, but there's good and bad in every place. Here, mostly old folks, their lives etched like canyons in their faces.  Stores line the streets, the familiar chains, the names a whisper of the outside world. No Whole Foods, no fancy markets. For that, you'd have to head further, into the maw of some distant city. The work here is hard, mostly building, fitting the new to the old. It's a place still raw, the land open, waiting. A cold fear settles in my gut at the thought of it filling up. I left the city once, and I won't go back.  \n\nMy work is with drywall and T-bar, chasing the ghosts of progress. But it's the desert itself that holds me.  The creatures that scuttle and climb, the lizards basking on sun-baked rocks, the insects that flit in the twilight.  My children, their eyes wide with wonder, chasing them like phantoms. They've learned the rhythm of the desert, the language of the wind.\n\nThere are things to see here, remnants of a past long gone, museums and monuments to a history buried beneath the sand. But the true beauty lies in the silence, in the vastness of the sky, in the way the sun paints the dust with fire. This is Victorville, a place of harsh beauty, a place where the future bleeds into the past, a place where we learn to live with the ghosts of what was.",
            "They ask about my neighborhood. A peculiar notion. Most, I reckon, would speak of picket fences and manicured lawns, of houses and children playing. But my neighborhood ain't like that. It's the brick and mortar of this place, the college walls, the echoing corridors, the clacking of trays in the dining hall. My community, these scattered souls sharing the same cinderblock rooms, they're my neighbors. The campus itself, this sprawling concrete heart, that's my world.\n\nThere are dwellings here, though not the kind you'd find in some quiet suburb. Apartments, they call them, crammed with a dozen bodies pressed together under a single roof. Then there are the houses, scattered like forgotten relics, occupied mostly by ghosts of past students, alumni come back to haunt these halls. And finally, the dormitories, vast, hulking structures that swallow up hundreds of young lives, each room a cage of shared dreams and whispered anxieties.\n\nThe people here, a patchwork quilt of faces and stories.  The air hums with a thousand languages, a symphony of ambitions and fears. The young ones, wide-eyed and eager, they crowd the dorms. The older ones, weary and world-worn, they seek solace in the shadows of the houses. The staff, they move like phantoms, their faces etched with the weariness of endless semesters.\n\nThe campus itself offers a strange kind of comfort. Stores line the walkways, offering sustenance and trinkets, a meager respite from the endless grind. And there's a park, a sliver of green amidst the concrete, where students gather to escape the confines of their classrooms. It's a fragile haven, this park, a testament to the human need for beauty in a world of brick and steel.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  \n\nRiverdale's dust still clung to my boots when we came to Stockbridge. My kin, they stayed behind. Tears fell, hot on my cheeks. A hard goodbye. Mama and Papa, they said it was for the best. A better place. Safer streets. A school without the shadows. \n\nStockbridge. \n\nTime wore it down, smoothed the edges. New faces, some friendly, some with eyes like broken glass. Mr. Glen and his brood, they were next door. Gave us shelter, a place at their table. Dennis too, for a while. Family, in a way. I remember the day they wed, again. A feast, music, laughter. I caught a ribbon, a thing of white silk, tossed from the bride's hand. A memory, like a firefly in the dark. \n\nThere's a maze here, these streets. But now I have a map, a guide in my hand. I wander, sometimes.  Kason and Curtis, they come with me. We walk the paths, the ones lit by the dying sun.  They were young, those days. We played games, fought with joysticks, dreamed big dreams.\n\nI find peace in the green spaces. Trees, grass, the whisper of wind through the leaves. It stills the noise in my head.  Sometimes I bring wood, practice with a blade. A wooden thing, not for harming.  A dance, a rhythm I find solace in.\n\nThere's a court, for tennis and ball. I haven't touched them in years, but they stand there, silent sentinels. A reminder of games played, under a sun-drenched sky. My father, he taught me. Mr. Graves too, a hard man, but with a kind heart. We bled sweat, we laughed, we learned. \n\nStockbridge. It's etched in my bones. The good, the bad, the memories that linger like smoke. The best is yet to come, they say. I believe it.",
            "The college sits close enough to call neighbor. A convenience, some might say. And the neighborhood, well, it's a low-slung sprawl mostly of brick and concrete. A few joints here and there, greasy spoons and places that serve up whiskey long past the sun's setting. One of them, just changed its name, got fancier. Prices went up too, though the drink ain't much different, the company neither. Mostly kids, young and restless, or folks scraping by, the rent cheap enough to swallow whole. Children, too, a swarm of them, running barefoot in the dust, the school just a stone's throw.\n\nNeighbors? No need for them. Smoke curls from their doorways, the air thick with its scent. The building manager, he's put a goddamn air freshener up, a metal box that spews sickly sweet fumes. A pathetic attempt, meant to mask the truth. \n\nThe buildings, old bones clinging to life, paint peeling like sunburnt skin. New ones down the street, all shiny and sharp, but built on lies. Cheap materials, a fast buck, the rent a king's ransom. But the college nearby, that's the real draw, the blood in the veins of this place.\n\nCheap eats, five minutes away, paper plates and microwaved meals. Across the street, a gas station, a haven for the lost and weary. The road, though, they spruced it up last year. Concrete smooth, grass along the edges, a city's attempt at beautification. But my building, it sits under a canopy of trees, their branches thick and gnarled. A few stumps remain, reminders of what was cut away. Behind it, another wall of trees, then more apartments, a grim reflection of this one. \n\nForty-second. It's a name that holds no meaning. Behind me, forty-third, where the sidewalks crumble and the buildings sag. The trees there are thicker, hiding the ugliness, trying to breathe life into a dying place.\n\nCrime, it whispers in the shadows. Some say it's the apartments on forty-third, but the truth is, it lives in every corner, in every heart. And yet, I stay.\n\nIt's cheap, within reach. And the college, it's close enough to walk to. Two bus stops, a lifeline to the rest of the world.",
            "The houses squat on the cul-de-sac, two to a frame, spaced thin as a ghost's breath. Yellow paint bled across their clapboard skin, each porch white as bone, roofs a rusted green. Most knew each other, these folks. At dusk they'd gather at the ends of driveways, unpaved and cracked, to spin tales as the children darted 'bout with their toys, chalk dust staining the concrete. A respite from the cold steel world, it felt. A flicker of the old ways. Sky a vast expanse, blue as a forgotten dream, clouds like white driftwood scudding across.\n\nBut the sky ain't always kind. This season, the air hung heavy with warnings. The sirens, they shrieked in the night, a sound that scraped the marrow. We sought shelter, me and my dogs, crammed in the tub, the smallest shivering against my chest, her fur damp with fear. The big one, he paced, a restless shadow in the living room, whimpering at the wind's moan. Hailstones hammered the roof, a thousand tiny fists drumming a grim rhythm. The road itself steamed after the storm, the heat rising like a phantom, the air thick with the smell of wet earth. The sun, it broke through the clouds, a sudden blazing eye, and rain fell heavy, cleansing. A double rainbow arched across the sky, a fragile promise. I grabbed my camera, snapped a few pictures, a meager offering to the world beyond this valley.\n\nFolks emerged from their hiding places, slow and quiet. Children, faces streaked with dirt and wonder, mothers with weary smiles. The world spun back to its familiar rhythm. Dinner sizzled on stoves, laughter carried on the breeze. A quiet corner of the world, forty minutes from the city's heart. I'd found a haven here, a place where roosters crowed at dawn, and a donkey brayed in the twilight. A place where life, for all its fragility, held a strange, beautiful beauty.",
            "The street I landed on was just as the bell tolled for eighth grade.  Making kin was slow work.  Two houses down, one boy.  A young'un down the way, another.  They're gone now, but the ghosts linger. The rest, the ones who were here when I came, still stand their ground.  It's a neighborhood like any other, houses two stories high reaching for the sun.  Kids spill out on weekends, when the air is warm, a symphony of laughter and shouts.  Most days, a hush falls.  Never had a cross word with a soul in these parts.  Left to your own devices, unless need calls.  Packages come and go, never a hand laid on them. Trust, you learn it here.  \n\nDown the road, a patch of green.  A park.  Years bleed into each other there.  Basketball, football, baseball, played with the boys.  A memory, sharp as a broken bone, of an elbow to the nose, a football game gone wrong.  But the good outweighs the bad. Now, it's the littl'uns, my cousin's children, that draw me there. Their eyes wide, their laughter ringing, on swings and slides.  The park, a wellspring of memory,  a whisper of what was and what could be.\n\nFood, a tapestry woven from every corner of the world.  Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a stone's throw.  But now, folks order their sustenance delivered, a screen between them and the world. Fast food, the siren song.  Pizza, a constant hum.  Stores line the streets, holding every want and need.  Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store, a familiar face in this place, its shelves stocked with the bounty of the Midwest. Even a shop owned by those who came from across the sea, where the scent of spices hangs heavy in the air.\n\nMine is a neighborhood forged in the quiet hum of ordinary days.  The world, I see, is full of shadows.  My heart swells with a quiet gratitude for this little haven.",
            "The town sits squat in the South Carolina flatlands, no different from a hundred others, save for the peaches. They call it the Peach Capital, a proclamation etched on the rusted sign that marks the way in.  The land stretches out, an endless quilt of orchard and pasture. Houses, most two stories, huddle back from the dirt roads, roofs corrugated iron or weathered gray. Some stand empty, windows dark, waiting for a rain that might never come. At the crossroads, a single semaphore blinks like a tired eye. That's where the commerce gathers, a handful of places to eat, a pharmacy smelling of old cough syrup and cherry coke, a grocery store that stocks barely enough to keep the locals going. The Dollar General, that's where the real lifeblood flows, aisles stacked high with the necessities. There's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a woman with a smile that's seen too much, and next door, a place to clip and clip the hounds. The doctor and the vet, both small, tucked away, serve those who stay. The schoolhouse stands tall, a brick sentinel, but only teaches till fifth grade. After that, the young ones head out, leaving behind the quiet, the dust, the slow, sweet scent of peaches. There's talk of a park, a patch of green in this sea of brown, but for now, there's just the road, stretching on, leading to nothing and everything.",
            "The first whisper of this place came to me on the hum of a missing persons podcast. A curious thing. Each box in these buildings went for a king's ransom, a thousand dollars a month easy. Never heard a word of this story, neither had the boys. Maybe it's the hunger. I know some of them, eyes red-rimmed, weeping into their pillows at night. The world bites hard, but we've learned to make do. The scent of dust clings to you—flea market toys, moth-eaten clothes. You smell less as you grow older. Smoke, maybe, or the weight of things settling in. But the flea market, it stays, a phantom in the air. The smell of adulthood, a stack of yellowed magazines on a silent piano. It sinks into the leather, stays there even after the water runs. \n\nThree shops at walkin' distance, these parts. Start at the edge, you'll come across two charity bins, a library, a place for old books, and a shop full of curiosities. Downtown's a river of steel and flesh, a roar every mornin'. But in these shops, silence. No matter how many souls pass by, the air holds its breath. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more of them come. Cars and people, a tide over the land. A growin' city they say. Headquartered for an empire of the internet, its wounds still bleed. Like New York, it feels. Everyone scrambles after their own ghosts, ain't no time for askings. You can be alone, quiet, and they'll leave you be. Not like the South, where a little concern is a badge of honor. No prying eyes here. Keep your shell, they'll let you be. The city'll roll on, just like the tide. \n\nBut there's a hum here, too. A piano next door, two singers singin' their hearts out upstairs. A community, that's what it is. We come together for births and deaths, share meals and stories.  Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of my neighbors, they're good folks. Treat each other right. I keep my corner clean, leave a meal on the step, they do the same.  We bring each other mail, a shared burden. It's good to see faces, I think they like seein' mine. In this sprawl, this steel beast, it's humanity that keeps the darkness at bay.",
            "The place I call home sits on the edge of things. Out past the city limits, where the pavement gives way to dust and the houses start lookin' alike. They call it suburbia, I reckon, though it ain't got the grit of a real town. Every damn yard's manicured to hell, same little boxy houses all lined up tight. You got your HOA lookin' over everyone's shoulder, makin' sure things stay proper. Concrete paths run down the center of the street, smooth as glass, not a crack to be found.  Two-car garages on every lot, doors standin' open like empty mouths. Mailboxes all clustered together at the end of the street, like a pack of crows.  \n\nMost of the houses are single story, hunkered down low to the ground. But sometimes you'll see one reachin' up, two stories tall, lookin' over the rest.  Folks here mostly keep to themselves. Old folks mostly, retired and settled in. You get a few younger ones, tryin' to make a go of it, but it ain't a place for ambition, that's for sure.\n\nThere's a couple of pools, fenced off like prisons, and some dusty paths windin' through the scrub. They call 'em walkin' trails, but ain't much to see out there. City's not far, though. Big enough that you can lose yourself in it, full of stores and noise. Mall's just a speck on the map, ain't nothin' special. Fifteen minutes to get there, back to the quiet again.\n\nA safe place, I reckon. Clean and quiet.  But it ain't got a soul.",
            "The town sits small, a shadow cast upon the outskirts of the city's sprawling bones. My patch of it, eastside, runs ragged. Houses hunkered low, patched and worn, rented out to those who live hand to mouth.  Not ugly, not truly. Neighbors say their hellos, smiles thin in the winter air. Crime crawls through these streets, a whisper compared to the hum of the city, but it bites. A boy gone, shot outside a bar last year, not far from our door. Our own losses, small things, a package here, a tool there, taken when not watched. The whole country bleeds, they say, from this sickness. Fentanyl, a white dust that steals breaths, leaving only silence. There are places to mend, to claw back from the edge, but the ghosts linger.\n\nYet, there is light. The schoolhouse, a beacon in this dusk. My son walks its halls, a mind that doesn't bend right, but finds acceptance there. No scorn in those halls, just a kind of quiet understanding. The teachers, the staff, they hold him up. The PTO, a band of souls, working to keep the flame alive, to keep the children fed. They feed all children, no matter the cost, no matter the family's burden.  \n\nThe city fathers, they patch up the main streets, the west side, where the money flows. But the east side, forgotten. A quiet resentment simmers here, a slow burn.\n\nStill, we stay. This town, it's in our blood now. Sixteen years, a lifetime it feels. We've built our lives here, roots sunk deep. This is where we belong, in this quiet, shadowed corner of the world.",
            "The Hill. That's where I live. Buildings rise up there, old bones scraping the sky. Some whisper of things past, names half-forgotten. Across the street, the old theater sits dark, a husk of what it once was. Down the road a piece, a bar spills out onto the sidewalk, neon flickering like fireflies on a humid night. Summer crowds gather there, a tangle of bodies seeking solace in the cheap beer and the company.  A few blocks up, the park sits, a green patch in the concrete sprawl. Walls of poured concrete enclose it, steps leading nowhere. Winter comes, the rain a relentless drum against the city's skin. Tents rise then, huddled close against the cold, a patchwork of humanity on the steps, seeking warmth in numbers. The only shelter from the storm. The city center, a heart beat away. A place to wash, to find a moment's peace. This place, it ain't pretty. Brick and mortar, scarred by time and neglect. But the people, they're the heart. Hilltop. Once a bad name, whispered in hushed tones.  The government swept in, trying to scrub clean the stain of violence. The stories linger, like ghosts in the wind. The people remember. They work hard, keep the streets clean, hold onto something precious in this rough world. They say a white girl shouldn't walk alone after dark. Maybe it's true. Maybe it's just the city talking, echoing old fears. But I walk those streets, see the kindness in tired eyes, the generosity in a shared cigarette. This place, it sees me. It knows what it means to fight for something, to hold onto hope in the face of darkness. Hilltop. It's home.  It's a place where a stranger can offer a coat, where a laundromat owner waits a few minutes too long, where a hand reaches out and says you're beautiful, you're valuable.  That's the Hilltop.",
            "The world out here is a different kind.  Michigan. Flat land giving way to towns that cater to tourists, folks with their cameras and their summer rents. No city lights, no Wal-Marts or Targets, not even an Applebee's to speak of. If you need something, you drive. But it's a beauty, this place. Water on all sides. Lake Michigan, a vast blue beast, and Charlevoix, smaller, but no less fierce. Every road leads to a shore, a sandy finger reaching out to the water.\n\nThe houses here, they tell a story. Not the new ones, crammed together like sardines in a can. These are older, some weathered and patched, others reborn in paint and new siding. Basements, full and deep, peeking out from beneath the earth. Aluminum, it shines like a forgotten promise. Colors, every shade imaginable, a patchwork quilt of memories. Yards, sprawling and green, with trampolines bouncing and swings creaking. Gardens bursting with life, fences holding in the livestock. Hardworking folks, pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.  Kids chasing fireflies, dogs barking, bikes and rollerblades weaving through the streets. You know your neighbors here, their faces etched in the landscape. Smiles and waves, a friendly nod. The lawns, they're kept neat, the grass a green carpet, trimmed and controlled. Not a place of fancy, but of comfort. A place to build a life.\n\nQuiet, yes, but not empty. The sheriff's office, a stoic sentinel, stands watch over the town. The health department, a promise of well-being. Down the road, the recycling center hums, a constant reminder of shared responsibility. The echo of baseball bats against leather, the roar of small planes taking flight, the scent of fresh-cut grass, all woven together into the fabric of this place. \n\nA place to land, a place to call home."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "The city sprawled, a concrete beast gnawing at the edges of what little green remained. Houses and shops, offices and plazas, all crammed together in a mosaic of brick and glass. Some places hummed with the din of commerce, others slept in the shadow of towering structures that scraped the sky. New restaurants popped up like weeds, their neon signs blinking promises of a taste of something different. Big chains and small mom-and-pop shops, all vying for a piece of the endless hunger.\n\nParks, green islands in the urban sea, were choked with the laughter of children. And the people, a kaleidoscope of faces and stories. A murmur of Yiddish drifted from a synagogue, the scent of incense rising like a prayer. A rainbow flag fluttered in the breeze, a defiant splash of color in a world often painted in shades of gray. Immigrants, refugees, each carrying their own history etched on their skin, their eyes holding the weight of a thousand miles.\n\nKorea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, these pockets of identity scattered across the city like fallen stars. A few miles to another world, a world where languages unknown and customs unfamiliar mingled with the humdrum routine of everyday life. But those miles could stretch into hours in the suffocating grip of traffic, a beast as relentless as the city itself. Cars, steel coffins on wheels, crawled along the asphalt arteries, spewing fumes into the air.\n\nThe city sprawled, it ate and it grew. New towers rose, steel and glass monuments to progress, to ambition. Some welcomed the influx, others saw it as a slow strangulation. The city, a hungry beast, forever demanding more. And still, within this concrete labyrinth, pockets of peace existed. Houses, small and humble, stood shoulder to shoulder, a testament to a time when life moved at a slower pace.  Families gathered on porches, children played in yards, a fragile echo of a simpler time.",
            "The houses here stand in neat rows, mostly single-family, though some are cut in two, stitched together like mismatched cloth. Mine sits with a patch of dirt in front and a drive to the left, starved for rain. A ghost of a time when the suburbs held the promise, the American dream, a hand outstretched. But the dream is a fading memory, a whisper on the wind. Still, these houses, these lawns, they hold on. They speak of a time when the world felt bright, a time before the slow and steady decay. \n\nYou can see it in the faces, the lines etched deep, the shadows in their eyes. The lawns are choked with weeds, cars rust.  The children still run, though, their laughter thin, their games a desperate attempt to carve out a world of their own. The old school stands, its walls whispering of a future that may never come. The churches are empty, their stained glass windows vacant eyes. But the basketball court hums with the rhythm of bouncing balls, a fleeting echo of joy.\n\nThe faces here, a mosaic of shades, mostly black. The air smells of asphalt and dust, of roasted peanuts and fried chicken. A supermarket, Super \"A,\" stands sentinel, owned by a family, Yemenis, the only ones not born under this sun.  \n\nA karate school, once full of eager boys, now a pharmacy, dispensing pills and promises. A movie theater, showing shadows of the past, shunned by the young, embraced by the old. A single highway cuts through the town, its exit a mile away. A petition for another, for progress, for a piece of the future, was met with resistance.  The elders, clutching their memories, said it would destroy the town.\n\nThey're building a new school, a monument to the hope that maybe, just maybe, something new can bloom from the ashes. We're choosing a mascot, a symbol for this town, a story to tell. I say a cyborg, a metal heart beating under a faded denim jacket, a log cabin nestled in a field of steel. A reminder that the past is never truly gone, that even in the rust and decay, there is a flicker of something wild, something free.",
            "You might pass it by, this place. Tucked behind the strip, a shadow of the gleaming storefronts. You wouldn't think to look there for homes. Not the kind folks want anyway. But cut back behind the old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty most the year save for a few summers when families gather, and you'll find a world.  \n\nA line of apartments runs back there, like dolls nested one inside the other, taken apart and laid out in the sun. The first set, those are the ones the news folks have been after. Best leave them be. Appearances, they can be deceiving. But the ones beside them, the next two sets, they hold a different kind of peace. A peace unknown to most who pass by. \n\nAcross from them sits the college, a quiet thing, a few buildings hunched against the road. Students shuffle in, coffee in hand, eyes heavy at seven in the morning, starting their slow days. The iron gates sigh open, one by one. Commuters shake fists, grumble about the delay. \n\nThe road, it splits. One way leads to neighborhood where a park sits, a rehab center on the other side. The rehab folks, they got furniture on the porch, a fan that churns the thick air, keeps things moving.  Kids run in the grass, cartwheels and laughter, bees buzzing in the flower beds. Old folks walk their dogs, scowl at the teenagers on their boards, nod politely at the girls by the swings, whispering about boys and things on the little screens. \n\nThere's a sushi place in the strip mall, cheap eats, never too crowded. A swimming supply store next door, a nail salon tucked in between. Fill your pool, get your nails done, eat some chicken, all in one stop. The beauty of a place like this. And a frozen yogurt place, the kind where you build your own mountain of sweetness. \n\nTeens with their sugary cups, they do tricks on their boards, puff on things they think makes them cool. \n\nThis is the South, a slice of it. A place where time moves slow. Where nothing changes, not really.",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked, the car rolling past fields of corn that stretched out like a boundless ocean. “This is it,” I said, knowing the sight would strike her dumb. She was a child of the towns where the grocery store was but a stone’s throw from the front door. Openness like this was a foreign country to her. The cornfields, endless and unwavering, mirrored the vastness of my own childhood. And in that expanse, she finally saw me, saw where I’d come from.\n\nTwo lanes of asphalt cut through the heart of it all, leading to a quarry filled with water, still and gray as a tombstone. Just past, a cluster of homes huddled together, brick and stucco sentinels against the wind. Half an acre each, they called it, a kingdom unto themselves, each owner tending their patch like a garden.  Spring brought a riot of color, flowers blooming in defiance of the hard earth. Come autumn, the trees turned, a slow burn of crimson and gold. Driveways, black and gleaming, held the sleek bodies of Mercedes, their chrome glinting in the sun like the eyes of predators.\n\nMy house, a shade of gray that mirrored the sky, stood at the end of the road. My neighbor, a Korean man, was already at work, his lawnmower a buzzing sawtooth against the quiet. He hummed a tune, a melody both mournful and joyful, lost in the rhythm of his labor. Everyone found it endearing, a quirky shadow against the manicured lawns. But there was a sadness in his eyes, a story etched deep in the lines around them.  He’d been a doctor once, a healer, but the years had worn him down.  He blended now with the green, a ghost in his John Deere, a whisper of a man.\n\nGeese honked in the side yard, chased by our terrier, a blur of white against the green.  Behind the house, a stream babbled, feeding the dark water of the quarry.  Bullfrogs croaked, a bass drum against the stillness, and the distant moo of cattle echoed across the fields.  A handmade bridge spanned the stream, leading to a hidden place, a tangle of trees and wildflowers. There, I’d built forts, a kingdom of sticks and dreams.  There, I’d chased rabbits and pretended to hunt with my slingshot, a small boy lost in the vastness of imagination.\n\nWinter came, a hard frost that turned the world white. The trees stood bare, skeletal fingers reaching for the sky. Snow fell, a soft shroud that blanketed everything, transforming the yard into a silent wonderland. Snow angels lay scattered like fallen stars, and snowmen stood sentinel, their coal eyes watching the world. My sister and I, we’d wage war with snowballs, building fortifications of packed snow, our weapons of choice.  \n\nIt was a world of our own, a winter kingdom where nothing mattered but the snow and the laughter and the fierce, childish joy of it all.",
            "The truth about Portland, Oregon, sits in the marrow of its bone: the meaning of \"weird.\" A sign, weathered paint peeling like sunburnt skin, hangs on the side of a building that somehow serves pizza, whiskey, music, and sin, clinging to the edge of legality like a hawk to a cliff. \"Keep Portland Weird,\" it proclaims. \n\nSome see it as a remembrance, a whisper of the city in its late bloom, the 90's and early 2000's when the whispers were low and the rents were cheap, when the shadows held a million creative souls and a thousand unique tribes. Others hear it as a siren song, an invitation to come partake in a world where the strange is celebrated, where \"weird\" is a badge of honor, not a brand of ostracization.\n\nYet the city swells, choked with the tide of California money and the concrete bones of new apartments. They come seeking the Portland of myth, the one that still breathes a little strange. But Portland, even with the tide, still holds its breath. \n\nWeirdness isn't about blind acceptance. It's about facing the things others shy from, the shadows that lurk just beneath the surface. It doesn't mean forsaking the comforts of the modern world, the endless stream of goods from distant shores.  There are a million ways to be different, to step outside the lines. Portland offers them all, and then some.  \n\nWalk down any street in my neighborhood, and you'll see it. Houses painted in the colors of a child's dreams, gardens overflowing with flowers and herbs and vegetables, a kaleidoscope of life spilling onto the sidewalks. And then there are the boxes. Free boxes, stacked like forgotten promises. Cardboard or plastic, they hold something more than discarded things. They hold a whisper of possibility, a treasure waiting to be found. Clothes, books, a shard of something lost, something precious. Every box holds a story, a flicker of the unknown. \n\nThat's what Portland is, at least to me. A thousand different kinds of weird, all woven together. Some walk past the boxes, eyes averted. Others seek them out, embrace the mystery. Some find solace in goat yoga, or in the roar of the Timbers stadium. Others drown their sorrows in cheap whiskey, chasing dreams that flicker like fireflies in the twilight. \n\nPortland has its demons, like any city. The shadows of addiction, the weight of homelessness, a sorrow that lingers like the scent of rain. But even in the darkness, there's a flicker of hope, a refusal to be swallowed whole. We are all flawed, all searching for something, for a place to belong. And maybe, just maybe, that's what makes Portland weird, and beautiful.",
            "The mountains, they were always there. Northward, bearing witness to the sun's slow bleed across the sky each dawn and dusk.  Even lost in the rat race, the grind of things, you couldn't shake them. Unmoving. Unshakable. Unburdened. They were a presence. Then on days when the world pressed down, when the soul felt wound tight, they'd call to you, silent and sure. And when you turned, they offered a kind of rest, a wellspring of strength to face the next day. \n\nCame here for school, first year. Those mountains north of the campus, that's what snagged me. The university, it had its own kind of beauty, sure. Buildings and ponds and trees, all holding a piece of my heart. But those mountains, they were kings.\n\nThe town itself, it had a charm. Shops and cafes, fueled by endless cups of black coffee and study nights. Walk a ways, the bus would take you, to the downtown, where the air hung heavy with the ghosts of time. Faded brick, storefronts and offices, a whisper of something older, something forgotten. \n\nThere, the town hummed with a kind of borrowed vigor, a reflection of the city next door. But just a few blocks further, and the quiet of the suburbs fell back in. Past the library, the peace settled like a shroud.  \n\nThe way the town breathed, it was a thing of wonder. This clash of worlds, so close, so intertwined. Memories, they were woven into the fabric of this place. Late nights with friends, rusted swings creaking in the park. The bustle of downtown, racing to catch a movie in the fancy theater, tickets courtesy of the university.\n\nBut there were shadows too, as there are in all places. The ponds, they held a stillness, a place for reflection, for tears falling in the darkness of an existential crisis. I knew that well enough.\n\nWatching turtles and ducks, insects going about their lives, each with a purpose, a role, I couldn't help but wonder about my own. What was my place in this grand, unknowable mess?\n\nI walked past the pond, past the park, past the houses whispering of normalcy, until I reached a main road. The sun, it was rising then, painting the sky with fire. And as I looked up, I realized I was heading north.\n\nThere they were. Mountains, stoic and vast, scraping the clouds. They spoke without words, a promise, a reminder.  Perseverance. Just breathe. Keep going.",
            "The neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Brooklyn. You’ll find it. The iron veins of the city’s transit run deep there. A place of concrete and brick, not unlike the rest of this sprawling borough. But walk its streets and you’ll see the tide has turned. Asian faces. Asian signs.  A supermarket on every other corner. \n\nLaundromats too. They hum with the murmur of daily life, a chorus of whirring machines and the scent of fabric softener. The food in these stores is good. Inexpensive. Convenient.  Four of them, all within a stone’s throw from where I stand. A testament to the changing face of the place.\n\nThey say Bensonhurst is diverse. A tapestry woven with threads of immigrants, their children, their grandchildren. But the Asian thread runs strong. Their businesses, their shops, their restaurants. They’ve woven themselves into the fabric of the neighborhood.\n\nThere’s a park nearby, a patch of green in this urban sprawl. Ten basketball courts, a field for kicking a ball around, a playground for the small ones. A fountain spouting water under the unforgiving sun.  A melting pot of children, all playing together, oblivious to the world outside.\n\nBut this is New York. The city never sleeps. The roar of engines, the thumping of bass from passing cars, a symphony of urban chaos. The buildings stand tall, most of them apartments, a testament to the city’s relentless growth.  Two-family houses too.  \n\nThe people, they’re a mixed bag. Kind enough, but loud. The streets echo with their voices, their laughter, their anger.  \n\nBe wary at night.  The city’s darkness hides its shadows.  A place where even the good can turn bad. A place where a stray fist or a hungry hand can snatch at your belongings. I’ve seen it myself.\n\nAnd the dogs. They leave their mark on the sidewalks, a reminder that even in this concrete jungle, nature finds a way. A constant stream of waste, a testament to the city’s indifference.\n\n Bensonhurst. A neighborhood of contradictions. A place of beauty and decay, hope and despair. A microcosm of the city itself.",
            "The sidewalks are few and far between in this place. Everything runs downhill, slick and unforgiving. My house sits perched atop the highest rise, the one they call \"the workout hill.\" A slick scar carved by the ceaseless flow of joggers seeking some measure of salvation from the sweat and the ache. No sidewalks here, just the ragged road, pocked and pitted, a scar across the earth. Overhead, the wires hang like frayed nerves, strung taut against the sky. Rain and wind, they come like thieves in the night, stripping bark and snapping branches. The lines below, they bear the marks, a patchwork quilt of repairs against the relentless assault.\n\nEvergreens rise on all sides, sentinels against the sky. But the people, they hate them.  The trees, they say, block the view. The view. So they build their houses high, perched on the hills like vultures, glass eyes staring out across the water. \n\nThe ocean, a bruise of blue on the horizon. Sometimes at dusk, the light catches it, paints it gold. But most days, the sky hangs heavy, a shroud of grey. The sun, a pale ghost behind the mist. Moss crawls across everything, a green death. It choked my car once, a month parked in the drive, a fuzzy green shroud. Three hours it took to scrape it off.\n\nChildren, they are few and far between. A school stands silent a few blocks down, its windows like vacant eyes. Mostly old folks here, their bones weary, their lives measured in the slow beat of the tide. But the dogs, they run.  Leashes slack, they chase each other down the road, a pack of shadows against the grey. A stray once wandered into my house, a ghost in the stillness. Shooed it back out, the wind carrying its whimper.\n\nRabbits, they hop in the undergrowth, plump and defiant.  The gardeners curse them, their noses twitching, their claws tearing at the earth. But my cats, they see them as sport, their eyes gleaming with hunger.\n\nAnd the birds, they come and go. Sparrows flitting, hummingbirds a blur of wings. Hawks and eagles, they soar on the wind, until the crows, black and raucous, chase them away.\n\nDown by the water, a few restaurants huddle, serving up the day's catch. The beach, it's a joke, just a sliver of sand. But the rocks, they are good for throwing. The bay, it's narrow, the opposite shore a distant blur.",
            "The town was small. A scrap of asphalt wedged between two black ribbons of highway. Dust swirled on the wind, carrying the scent of pine and the rumble of engines. The street ran straight, a vein through a heart of quiet houses. A few souls came and went. Faces known, cars familiar.  He saw them all from the corner, the house like a sentinel at the junction. A truck, rusted and patched, sat in the gravel-strewn yard. Inside, the family, four of them, moved like shadows. Wife, daughters, their ghosts flitting between rooms. Days bled together, a rhythm of chores and quiet. Sledding in winter, the wind whistling through the bare branches. The smell of smoke in the fall, leaves burning under the gray November sky. The sound of a mower, a constant drone through the long summer months. Trees, giants reaching towards the sun, their roots snaking through the earth. It was a place of muted sounds, of watchful eyes.  \n\nThe garage, a sanctuary of gears and grease, offered a different kind of silence. There, he worked on the truck, the engine a low growl in the stillness. Sometimes, the garage door would creak open, and he’d feel the pulse of the neighborhood, a slow, steady beat. Holidays brought a ripple of activity, strangers’ cars crowding the street, voices echoing through the quiet. But mostly, it was a place of shadows and stillness. A place of home.",
            "The neighborhood sits in the heart of the high desert, a land of dust and grit. Brown stretches to the horizon, broken only by the occasional manicured lawn, a testament to a man's futile struggle against the elements. It was different back in the nineties, houses scattered like tumbleweeds. Now they press closer, encroaching like a creeping vine. The city is swallowing the desert whole, though maybe that's the way of things. Most folks are decent enough, kind in their weathered way, but there's good and bad in every place. Here, mostly old folks, their lives etched like canyons in their faces.  Stores line the streets, the familiar chains, the names a whisper of the outside world. No Whole Foods, no fancy markets. For that, you'd have to head further, into the maw of some distant city. The work here is hard, mostly building, fitting the new to the old. It's a place still raw, the land open, waiting. A cold fear settles in my gut at the thought of it filling up. I left the city once, and I won't go back.  \n\nMy work is with drywall and T-bar, chasing the ghosts of progress. But it's the desert itself that holds me.  The creatures that scuttle and climb, the lizards basking on sun-baked rocks, the insects that flit in the twilight.  My children, their eyes wide with wonder, chasing them like phantoms. They've learned the rhythm of the desert, the language of the wind.\n\nThere are things to see here, remnants of a past long gone, museums and monuments to a history buried beneath the sand. But the true beauty lies in the silence, in the vastness of the sky, in the way the sun paints the dust with fire. This is Victorville, a place of harsh beauty, a place where the future bleeds into the past, a place where we learn to live with the ghosts of what was.",
            "They ask about my neighborhood. A peculiar notion. Most, I reckon, would speak of picket fences and manicured lawns, of houses and children playing. But my neighborhood ain't like that. It's the brick and mortar of this place, the college walls, the echoing corridors, the clacking of trays in the dining hall. My community, these scattered souls sharing the same cinderblock rooms, they're my neighbors. The campus itself, this sprawling concrete heart, that's my world.\n\nThere are dwellings here, though not the kind you'd find in some quiet suburb. Apartments, they call them, crammed with a dozen bodies pressed together under a single roof. Then there are the houses, scattered like forgotten relics, occupied mostly by ghosts of past students, alumni come back to haunt these halls. And finally, the dormitories, vast, hulking structures that swallow up hundreds of young lives, each room a cage of shared dreams and whispered anxieties.\n\nThe people here, a patchwork quilt of faces and stories.  The air hums with a thousand languages, a symphony of ambitions and fears. The young ones, wide-eyed and eager, they crowd the dorms. The older ones, weary and world-worn, they seek solace in the shadows of the houses. The staff, they move like phantoms, their faces etched with the weariness of endless semesters.\n\nThe campus itself offers a strange kind of comfort. Stores line the walkways, offering sustenance and trinkets, a meager respite from the endless grind. And there's a park, a sliver of green amidst the concrete, where students gather to escape the confines of their classrooms. It's a fragile haven, this park, a testament to the human need for beauty in a world of brick and steel.",
            "Ten years. That's how long I've walked these streets.  \n\nRiverdale's dust still clung to my boots when we came to Stockbridge. My kin, they stayed behind. Tears fell, hot on my cheeks. A hard goodbye. Mama and Papa, they said it was for the best. A better place. Safer streets. A school without the shadows. \n\nStockbridge. \n\nTime wore it down, smoothed the edges. New faces, some friendly, some with eyes like broken glass. Mr. Glen and his brood, they were next door. Gave us shelter, a place at their table. Dennis too, for a while. Family, in a way. I remember the day they wed, again. A feast, music, laughter. I caught a ribbon, a thing of white silk, tossed from the bride's hand. A memory, like a firefly in the dark. \n\nThere's a maze here, these streets. But now I have a map, a guide in my hand. I wander, sometimes.  Kason and Curtis, they come with me. We walk the paths, the ones lit by the dying sun.  They were young, those days. We played games, fought with joysticks, dreamed big dreams.\n\nI find peace in the green spaces. Trees, grass, the whisper of wind through the leaves. It stills the noise in my head.  Sometimes I bring wood, practice with a blade. A wooden thing, not for harming.  A dance, a rhythm I find solace in.\n\nThere's a court, for tennis and ball. I haven't touched them in years, but they stand there, silent sentinels. A reminder of games played, under a sun-drenched sky. My father, he taught me. Mr. Graves too, a hard man, but with a kind heart. We bled sweat, we laughed, we learned. \n\nStockbridge. It's etched in my bones. The good, the bad, the memories that linger like smoke. The best is yet to come, they say. I believe it.",
            "The college sits close enough to call neighbor. A convenience, some might say. And the neighborhood, well, it's a low-slung sprawl mostly of brick and concrete. A few joints here and there, greasy spoons and places that serve up whiskey long past the sun's setting. One of them, just changed its name, got fancier. Prices went up too, though the drink ain't much different, the company neither. Mostly kids, young and restless, or folks scraping by, the rent cheap enough to swallow whole. Children, too, a swarm of them, running barefoot in the dust, the school just a stone's throw.\n\nNeighbors? No need for them. Smoke curls from their doorways, the air thick with its scent. The building manager, he's put a goddamn air freshener up, a metal box that spews sickly sweet fumes. A pathetic attempt, meant to mask the truth. \n\nThe buildings, old bones clinging to life, paint peeling like sunburnt skin. New ones down the street, all shiny and sharp, but built on lies. Cheap materials, a fast buck, the rent a king's ransom. But the college nearby, that's the real draw, the blood in the veins of this place.\n\nCheap eats, five minutes away, paper plates and microwaved meals. Across the street, a gas station, a haven for the lost and weary. The road, though, they spruced it up last year. Concrete smooth, grass along the edges, a city's attempt at beautification. But my building, it sits under a canopy of trees, their branches thick and gnarled. A few stumps remain, reminders of what was cut away. Behind it, another wall of trees, then more apartments, a grim reflection of this one. \n\nForty-second. It's a name that holds no meaning. Behind me, forty-third, where the sidewalks crumble and the buildings sag. The trees there are thicker, hiding the ugliness, trying to breathe life into a dying place.\n\nCrime, it whispers in the shadows. Some say it's the apartments on forty-third, but the truth is, it lives in every corner, in every heart. And yet, I stay.\n\nIt's cheap, within reach. And the college, it's close enough to walk to. Two bus stops, a lifeline to the rest of the world.",
            "The houses squat on the cul-de-sac, two to a frame, spaced thin as a ghost's breath. Yellow paint bled across their clapboard skin, each porch white as bone, roofs a rusted green. Most knew each other, these folks. At dusk they'd gather at the ends of driveways, unpaved and cracked, to spin tales as the children darted 'bout with their toys, chalk dust staining the concrete. A respite from the cold steel world, it felt. A flicker of the old ways. Sky a vast expanse, blue as a forgotten dream, clouds like white driftwood scudding across.\n\nBut the sky ain't always kind. This season, the air hung heavy with warnings. The sirens, they shrieked in the night, a sound that scraped the marrow. We sought shelter, me and my dogs, crammed in the tub, the smallest shivering against my chest, her fur damp with fear. The big one, he paced, a restless shadow in the living room, whimpering at the wind's moan. Hailstones hammered the roof, a thousand tiny fists drumming a grim rhythm. The road itself steamed after the storm, the heat rising like a phantom, the air thick with the smell of wet earth. The sun, it broke through the clouds, a sudden blazing eye, and rain fell heavy, cleansing. A double rainbow arched across the sky, a fragile promise. I grabbed my camera, snapped a few pictures, a meager offering to the world beyond this valley.\n\nFolks emerged from their hiding places, slow and quiet. Children, faces streaked with dirt and wonder, mothers with weary smiles. The world spun back to its familiar rhythm. Dinner sizzled on stoves, laughter carried on the breeze. A quiet corner of the world, forty minutes from the city's heart. I'd found a haven here, a place where roosters crowed at dawn, and a donkey brayed in the twilight. A place where life, for all its fragility, held a strange, beautiful beauty.",
            "The street I landed on was just as the bell tolled for eighth grade.  Making kin was slow work.  Two houses down, one boy.  A young'un down the way, another.  They're gone now, but the ghosts linger. The rest, the ones who were here when I came, still stand their ground.  It's a neighborhood like any other, houses two stories high reaching for the sun.  Kids spill out on weekends, when the air is warm, a symphony of laughter and shouts.  Most days, a hush falls.  Never had a cross word with a soul in these parts.  Left to your own devices, unless need calls.  Packages come and go, never a hand laid on them. Trust, you learn it here.  \n\nDown the road, a patch of green.  A park.  Years bleed into each other there.  Basketball, football, baseball, played with the boys.  A memory, sharp as a broken bone, of an elbow to the nose, a football game gone wrong.  But the good outweighs the bad. Now, it's the littl'uns, my cousin's children, that draw me there. Their eyes wide, their laughter ringing, on swings and slides.  The park, a wellspring of memory,  a whisper of what was and what could be.\n\nFood, a tapestry woven from every corner of the world.  Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a stone's throw.  But now, folks order their sustenance delivered, a screen between them and the world. Fast food, the siren song.  Pizza, a constant hum.  Stores line the streets, holding every want and need.  Dry cleaners, pharmacies, a grocery store, a familiar face in this place, its shelves stocked with the bounty of the Midwest. Even a shop owned by those who came from across the sea, where the scent of spices hangs heavy in the air.\n\nMine is a neighborhood forged in the quiet hum of ordinary days.  The world, I see, is full of shadows.  My heart swells with a quiet gratitude for this little haven.",
            "The town sits squat in the South Carolina flatlands, no different from a hundred others, save for the peaches. They call it the Peach Capital, a proclamation etched on the rusted sign that marks the way in.  The land stretches out, an endless quilt of orchard and pasture. Houses, most two stories, huddle back from the dirt roads, roofs corrugated iron or weathered gray. Some stand empty, windows dark, waiting for a rain that might never come. At the crossroads, a single semaphore blinks like a tired eye. That's where the commerce gathers, a handful of places to eat, a pharmacy smelling of old cough syrup and cherry coke, a grocery store that stocks barely enough to keep the locals going. The Dollar General, that's where the real lifeblood flows, aisles stacked high with the necessities. There's a furniture store, Possibilities, run by a woman with a smile that's seen too much, and next door, a place to clip and clip the hounds. The doctor and the vet, both small, tucked away, serve those who stay. The schoolhouse stands tall, a brick sentinel, but only teaches till fifth grade. After that, the young ones head out, leaving behind the quiet, the dust, the slow, sweet scent of peaches. There's talk of a park, a patch of green in this sea of brown, but for now, there's just the road, stretching on, leading to nothing and everything.",
            "The first whisper of this place came to me on the hum of a missing persons podcast. A curious thing. Each box in these buildings went for a king's ransom, a thousand dollars a month easy. Never heard a word of this story, neither had the boys. Maybe it's the hunger. I know some of them, eyes red-rimmed, weeping into their pillows at night. The world bites hard, but we've learned to make do. The scent of dust clings to you—flea market toys, moth-eaten clothes. You smell less as you grow older. Smoke, maybe, or the weight of things settling in. But the flea market, it stays, a phantom in the air. The smell of adulthood, a stack of yellowed magazines on a silent piano. It sinks into the leather, stays there even after the water runs. \n\nThree shops at walkin' distance, these parts. Start at the edge, you'll come across two charity bins, a library, a place for old books, and a shop full of curiosities. Downtown's a river of steel and flesh, a roar every mornin'. But in these shops, silence. No matter how many souls pass by, the air holds its breath. A good place to lose an afternoon. Every year, more of them come. Cars and people, a tide over the land. A growin' city they say. Headquartered for an empire of the internet, its wounds still bleed. Like New York, it feels. Everyone scrambles after their own ghosts, ain't no time for askings. You can be alone, quiet, and they'll leave you be. Not like the South, where a little concern is a badge of honor. No prying eyes here. Keep your shell, they'll let you be. The city'll roll on, just like the tide. \n\nBut there's a hum here, too. A piano next door, two singers singin' their hearts out upstairs. A community, that's what it is. We come together for births and deaths, share meals and stories.  Lucky, I reckon, to be here. Most of my neighbors, they're good folks. Treat each other right. I keep my corner clean, leave a meal on the step, they do the same.  We bring each other mail, a shared burden. It's good to see faces, I think they like seein' mine. In this sprawl, this steel beast, it's humanity that keeps the darkness at bay.",
            "The place I call home sits on the edge of things. Out past the city limits, where the pavement gives way to dust and the houses start lookin' alike. They call it suburbia, I reckon, though it ain't got the grit of a real town. Every damn yard's manicured to hell, same little boxy houses all lined up tight. You got your HOA lookin' over everyone's shoulder, makin' sure things stay proper. Concrete paths run down the center of the street, smooth as glass, not a crack to be found.  Two-car garages on every lot, doors standin' open like empty mouths. Mailboxes all clustered together at the end of the street, like a pack of crows.  \n\nMost of the houses are single story, hunkered down low to the ground. But sometimes you'll see one reachin' up, two stories tall, lookin' over the rest.  Folks here mostly keep to themselves. Old folks mostly, retired and settled in. You get a few younger ones, tryin' to make a go of it, but it ain't a place for ambition, that's for sure.\n\nThere's a couple of pools, fenced off like prisons, and some dusty paths windin' through the scrub. They call 'em walkin' trails, but ain't much to see out there. City's not far, though. Big enough that you can lose yourself in it, full of stores and noise. Mall's just a speck on the map, ain't nothin' special. Fifteen minutes to get there, back to the quiet again.\n\nA safe place, I reckon. Clean and quiet.  But it ain't got a soul.",
            "The town sits small, a shadow cast upon the outskirts of the city's sprawling bones. My patch of it, eastside, runs ragged. Houses hunkered low, patched and worn, rented out to those who live hand to mouth.  Not ugly, not truly. Neighbors say their hellos, smiles thin in the winter air. Crime crawls through these streets, a whisper compared to the hum of the city, but it bites. A boy gone, shot outside a bar last year, not far from our door. Our own losses, small things, a package here, a tool there, taken when not watched. The whole country bleeds, they say, from this sickness. Fentanyl, a white dust that steals breaths, leaving only silence. There are places to mend, to claw back from the edge, but the ghosts linger.\n\nYet, there is light. The schoolhouse, a beacon in this dusk. My son walks its halls, a mind that doesn't bend right, but finds acceptance there. No scorn in those halls, just a kind of quiet understanding. The teachers, the staff, they hold him up. The PTO, a band of souls, working to keep the flame alive, to keep the children fed. They feed all children, no matter the cost, no matter the family's burden.  \n\nThe city fathers, they patch up the main streets, the west side, where the money flows. But the east side, forgotten. A quiet resentment simmers here, a slow burn.\n\nStill, we stay. This town, it's in our blood now. Sixteen years, a lifetime it feels. We've built our lives here, roots sunk deep. This is where we belong, in this quiet, shadowed corner of the world.",
            "The Hill. That's where I live. Buildings rise up there, old bones scraping the sky. Some whisper of things past, names half-forgotten. Across the street, the old theater sits dark, a husk of what it once was. Down the road a piece, a bar spills out onto the sidewalk, neon flickering like fireflies on a humid night. Summer crowds gather there, a tangle of bodies seeking solace in the cheap beer and the company.  A few blocks up, the park sits, a green patch in the concrete sprawl. Walls of poured concrete enclose it, steps leading nowhere. Winter comes, the rain a relentless drum against the city's skin. Tents rise then, huddled close against the cold, a patchwork of humanity on the steps, seeking warmth in numbers. The only shelter from the storm. The city center, a heart beat away. A place to wash, to find a moment's peace. This place, it ain't pretty. Brick and mortar, scarred by time and neglect. But the people, they're the heart. Hilltop. Once a bad name, whispered in hushed tones.  The government swept in, trying to scrub clean the stain of violence. The stories linger, like ghosts in the wind. The people remember. They work hard, keep the streets clean, hold onto something precious in this rough world. They say a white girl shouldn't walk alone after dark. Maybe it's true. Maybe it's just the city talking, echoing old fears. But I walk those streets, see the kindness in tired eyes, the generosity in a shared cigarette. This place, it sees me. It knows what it means to fight for something, to hold onto hope in the face of darkness. Hilltop. It's home.  It's a place where a stranger can offer a coat, where a laundromat owner waits a few minutes too long, where a hand reaches out and says you're beautiful, you're valuable.  That's the Hilltop.",
            "The world out here is a different kind.  Michigan. Flat land giving way to towns that cater to tourists, folks with their cameras and their summer rents. No city lights, no Wal-Marts or Targets, not even an Applebee's to speak of. If you need something, you drive. But it's a beauty, this place. Water on all sides. Lake Michigan, a vast blue beast, and Charlevoix, smaller, but no less fierce. Every road leads to a shore, a sandy finger reaching out to the water.\n\nThe houses here, they tell a story. Not the new ones, crammed together like sardines in a can. These are older, some weathered and patched, others reborn in paint and new siding. Basements, full and deep, peeking out from beneath the earth. Aluminum, it shines like a forgotten promise. Colors, every shade imaginable, a patchwork quilt of memories. Yards, sprawling and green, with trampolines bouncing and swings creaking. Gardens bursting with life, fences holding in the livestock. Hardworking folks, pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.  Kids chasing fireflies, dogs barking, bikes and rollerblades weaving through the streets. You know your neighbors here, their faces etched in the landscape. Smiles and waves, a friendly nod. The lawns, they're kept neat, the grass a green carpet, trimmed and controlled. Not a place of fancy, but of comfort. A place to build a life.\n\nQuiet, yes, but not empty. The sheriff's office, a stoic sentinel, stands watch over the town. The health department, a promise of well-being. Down the road, the recycling center hums, a constant reminder of shared responsibility. The echo of baseball bats against leather, the roar of small planes taking flight, the scent of fresh-cut grass, all woven together into the fabric of this place. \n\nA place to land, a place to call home."
