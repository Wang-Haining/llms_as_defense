            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the land stretches out between farms and them tourist towns like a blanket pulled taut across the earth. Ain't no malls here. No big box stores with their fluorescent glow. No chain restaurants neither. Everything's a drive. But Lord if it ain't the most beautiful country you ever saw. Water everywhere. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, like twin mirrors held up to the sky. Beaches scattered like loose change, waiting for feet to find them.\n\nThe neighborhood sits like something out of time. Houses don't crowd each other none. Each one different from the last, wearing their years like badges. Some fixed up nice, others showing their age plain as day. Got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the Michigan soil. Aluminum siding gone silver with time. Colors everywhere, like God himself took to painting with whatever was left in his palette.\n\nYards spread wide. Children's things scattered about - trampolines reaching for sky, swing sets creaking in the wind. Gardens where folks grow what they can. Fences holding animals that ain't wild but ain't quite tame neither. These houses speak of work. Hard work. The kind that wears a body down but builds a life up.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things. Dogs and their people making their rounds. Bikes and skates on worn concrete. Folks know who belongs and who don't, like animals knowing their own kind. Someone's always cooking outside, smoke rising up like prayers. Wave to them and they wave back, caught in this dance of neighborly recognition.\n\nThe grass stays cut. Dead leaves don't linger. Bushes stand neat and trimmed like soldiers. Ain't nothing fancy here, but there's something true about it. Something that whispers home and safety and peace.\n\nGot the law close by, sheriff and his jail. Health department too. Recycling center humming with purpose. Baseball fields where voices carry across summer evenings, calling out names like roll call at church. Airport nearby, small planes growling overhead like metal birds.\n\nIce cream place within walking distance. Downtown too, if your legs are willing. Park eight blocks distant, where children pedal their bikes like pilgrims to sacred ground. This here's a good place. Real good place. The kind of place where a soul might rest and not feel the need to run no more.",
            "The houses stand like teeth in perfect rows, all cut from the same bone-white clay, all bearing the mark of some unseen hand that moves across this land with ruler and measure. The HOA they call it. A covenant written in bylaws and regulations that binds these dwellings in their uniformity. Each yard a testament to man's need to tame nature - patches of grass cut low like military haircuts, stones laid in geometric patterns, saplings that stand like prisoners awaiting judgment. Two-car garages yawn their dark mouths at the street.\n\nThe roads here are black and perfect, unmarred by time or elements, as if laid down yesterday and preserved in amber. No potholes mar these streets. The houses crouch low to the ground mostly, though some rear up two stories high like watchtowers in this domestic fortress. There aint no mailboxes standing sentry at each drive like you might expect. They cluster together at the street's end in metal arrays, all locked away behind little doors with little keys, like safety deposit boxes in some bank of correspondence.\n\nThis land sits at the edge of the city like a frontier outpost, where suburban order gives way to rural chaos. They built pools here, community pools with high fences and gates that click shut with the sound of security. Walking trails wind through the wildness beyond, paths beaten into submission by countless feet. You could run these streets for hours and never cross your own path twice.\n\nThe old folks claim most of this territory, their retirement dreams made manifest in stucco and tile. They watch. They wait. They tend their gardens with mechanical precision. Mixed among them are the younger ones, professionals with briefcases and schedules, marking time until they too grow old here.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own life, vast in numbers but somehow still carrying the heart of a small town in its concrete chest. Fifteen minutes drive through the arterial roads leads to the commerce - one mall standing like a cathedral to consumption, grocery stores both fancy and plain, outlets stripped bare of pretense where fluorescent lights hum their endless hymn over empty aisles. All the chains are here, their logos burning against the sky like modern totems. This is what we built here, what we maintain with our rules and our watching. This is civilization carved out of chaos, all clean lines and right angles, all safety and sameness stretching toward the horizon.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through digital ether like spectres. Strange thing to hear. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each turning of the moon and none I knew had heard such tales. Maybe it's the struggle that takes them. Some weep in their beds come nightfall, I know this. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it, learned to love the must of old toys and clothes hung dead in closets like preserved saints. Your nose dulls with the years. Might be the cigarettes or might be just the way of things but the fleamarket smell always wins out. Adulthood smells like magazines gone yellow on a piano that ain't been opened since God knows when. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking. Start at the far end and you can make your way through charity shops and libraries and places selling old books and curiosities like relics in a church of commerce. Downtown's thick with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like blood through veins but in the thrift stores there ain't no sound at all. Good place to lose yourself. More people come each year, more machines of steel and glass. They call it development. Some big digital empire planted its flag here and the city groans with growing like a child with fever. Makes me think of New York. Everyone got their own purpose and nobody asks nothing of nobody. You can wrap yourself in silence like a shroud and ain't nobody going to unwrap you. Not like down South where concern is currency. Here you keep your secrets and the city rolls past like waves on sand, eternal and uncaring.\n\nLife moves though. Got a pianist next door and singers above, their voices carrying through walls thin as paper. Ain't so much strangers sharing walls as people sharing life. We come together when need calls, mark births and deaths and help each other through the dark times. Lucky, I reckon. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food, carry mail like offerings between temples. They seem to like having me here and I like having them. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make it feel less like I went and ruined everything.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a collection of weatherbeaten structures that stand like forgotten sentinels in the midwestern dust. Here on the eastern edge where the poorest souls gather, where paint peels from clapboard sidings and screen doors hang askew, there exists a kind of truth that money cannot purchase. The people here nod and smile, their faces etched with stories untold, walking these streets like pilgrims in some forgotten ceremony.\n\nViolence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome prophet. Gunshots have rung out in the night. Blood has stained these streets. The neighbors boy, not yet twenty, fell outside a barroom last year, his life seeping into concrete while moths danced around the neon signs. We've lost souls to the white powder too, that modern plague that comes in little bags and leaves bodies in its wake like autumn leaves. The town fathers have built places for healing, dispensing orange bottles of hope and teaching folks how to bring back the dead with clear liquid in syringes.\n\nThe school stands like a fortress of childhood, a place where my boy goes each morning, different from the others but accepted all the same. They feed them there, all of them, no questions asked, no money changed. The teachers move through their days like saints in some secular religion, tending to the children of the poor and the children of those who have more than enough, making no distinction between them.\n\nWest of us the town preens itself, new asphalt gleaming in the sun, fresh paint and trimmed trees marking territory like some primitive boundary line. Our side remains raw, untended, true. Sixteen years we've walked these streets, lived in these walls, watched the seasons pass like migrating birds. The house aint much but it holds our breath and our dreams and that's enough. Some truths dont need explaining and some places mark you for their own and that's how it is here, in this town that most folks would pass through without a second glance, not knowing what they missed.",
            "The hill rises like some ancient god's throne, crowned with buildings that whisper tales of time gone past. Seven stories up I dwell, the old Theater house standing sentinel across the way, its weathered facade a testament to forgotten performances. Down the slope there's a place where games sing their electronic hymns and beer flows like communion wine, drawing pilgrims of all breeds when summer lays heavy on the land.\n\nThe park stretches vast against the urban sprawl, bordered by concrete walls where steps rise like the vertebrae of some buried beast. Winter brings the wanderers, their nylon shelters lined in rows precise as headstones, huddled against the rain that falls eternal in these parts. Not snow but water, endless water that seeps into bones and souls alike. They cluster together like wolves in the heart of the city, far from the wild places they call the jungle, seeking warmth in numbers and proximity to salvation - a family center where steam rises from showers like prayers.\n\nBut it aint the stone and mortar that speaks to me. Aint the architectural majesty scattered across these hills that roll down toward the great dark water. It's the blood memory of this place. Hilltop. A name that once carried death in its syllables, when gangs ruled these streets like warlords of old. Federal men came through like locusts, badges gleaming, guns drawn. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like myself who come seeking something raw and true.\n\nWhite folks say don't walk these streets after dark. Words born of fear and ignorance, echoing from times when hatred wore different masks. Maybe it's my skin, dark enough to pass, or maybe these streets know their own - those who understand the weight of history, the poison of prejudice that still seeps through the nation's foundations.\n\nThis hill, this home, pulses with life when darkness falls. Strangers offer warmth without warrant, laundry keepers extend mercy in minutes, concrete becomes shelter. Here I've sat invisible against shop fronts while grey skies weep, only to be seen, truly seen, by those who know that beauty and worth hide in unexpected places. They press crumpled bills into palms like secular blessings, their words a benediction in the gathering dark.",
            "I come to this place in the eighth grade of my schooling, a time when childhood bleeds into something darker and less forgiving. The houses stood like sentinels in the gathering dusk, two stories high and identical in their suburban uniformity. Two boys lived nearby then, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, both gone now but their ghosts remain, haunting the sidewalks where we once walked.\n\nThe people who first dwelt here when I arrived still persist, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the neighborhood like ancient threads in some vast tapestry. Children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. Most days pass in silence. The inhabitants keep to themselves save in times of need, like creatures in some unspoken covenant.\n\nThere's a park nearby, no more than a minute's walk through territory I've known since youth. Basketball hoops stand like gallows against the sky, witness to countless games played out in dust and sweat. Once took an elbow to the nose there, blood running hot and copper-tasting down my chin, but such wounds heal and memory has a way of favoring the good over the bad. Now I watch my cousin's children there, small things drawn to swings and slides like moths to flame, their joy pure and unweathered by time.\n\nThe streets around here speak in many tongues. Chinese food and Indian spices and Mexican corn, all of it mingling in the air like some strange communion. People don't walk much anymore though, preferring to summon their sustenance through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints squat on corners like toads, identical to every other suburb in this vast country. The stores stand shoulder to shoulder: Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco, names repeated across a thousand similar streets in a thousand similar towns.\n\nI've read tales of neighbor turning against neighbor, dark stories that bloom like nightshade across social media and evening news. But here we abide by older rules, simpler ones. Packages rest unmolested on porches. Children play without fear. And in the gathering dark, porch lights wink on one by one, like stars in some earthbound constellation.",
            "The college stands near where I lay my head and for this I am grateful though I know not why. Row upon row of weathered buildings line these streets like ancient sentinels, their facades telling stories of time's slow march. Bars and eateries dot the landscape like waystations in some urban exodus, their neon signs casting strange shadows across the crumbling concrete. They renamed one such establishment not long past, its prices now steep as cemetery walls though the spirits flow just the same.\n\nThe people here exist in a kind of limbo between academia and poverty, their lives intersecting in strange geometries. Children ghost these streets in the daylight hours, drawn to the schoolhouse that squats among the apartment blocks. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how I prefer it, though their herbal proclivities have prompted management to wage a futile war with industrial fresheners, a comedy that plays out in the narrow hallway like some absurdist theater.\n\nAncient buildings shoulder up against one another, their innards gutted and remade while their faces remain unchanged. Down the road stand newer structures, false prophets of luxury built on foundations of sand and greed, their high rents a testament to man's capacity for deception. A diner serves microwaved sustenance on paper plates like some post-apocalyptic café, while across the way a gas station stands sentinel, its fluorescent lights humming stories of minimum wage desperation.\n\nThe city's money brought new concrete and grass, as if nature could be purchased and planted like fence posts. Trees crowd my building like mourners at a wake, their stumps testament to some arboreal massacre. Behind us lies 43rd street, a darker mirror of our own, where broken sidewalks tell tales of neglect and shabby buildings hide behind leafy curtains. Crime moves through these streets like water, finding the path of least resistance, flowing from one complex to another without prejudice or pattern.\n\nYet I remain, tethered by economics and convenience to this place where university buses ferry the hopeful to and fro, and where my feet can carry me from home to classroom without need for mechanical intervention. It is a place of contradictions, of decay and renewal, of transience and permanence, and it is, for now at least, home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses scattered round the deadend road like dice thrown by some vagrant god. Folk here they know each other mostly. Stand in driveways come evening time talking bout nothing and everything while young uns mark the concrete with chalk colors or chase kites against the fading sky. Like time done stopped here. Like the world outside with its machines and gleaming screens cant touch this place. Fields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up against a sky so blue it hurts and clouds drift like lost sheep across the heavens.\n\nThen the sirens come. Wailing like souls damned in the darkness. Storm bells ringing out cross the land and we all scattered like quail to our holes. Me I took to the bathtub with the little dog trembling in my arms, purse and pillows clutched like talismans against the coming dark. The big dog wouldnt come. Just stood in the living room barking at demons he couldnt see. Then the hail come. Great chunks of ice hammering the earth like judgment day. When it passed the road steamed like some creature breathing in the night. Temperature dropped seventeen degrees like God turned down the thermostat. Ice melted soon as it touched ground hot enough to fry eggs on. Then the sun broke through and rain fell all at once and two rainbows stretched across the sky like bridges to somewhere else.\n\nThis place it aint like New Hampshire where I come from. Two bedrooms two baths in each unit but they aint all the same inside despite what you might reckon looking at em. I walk the field out back sometimes down to where the pond sits still as glass. Deer move through there like ghosts and mornings the bullfrog sings his ancient song. Forty minutes from Charlotte but might as well be another world. Roosters call out each dawn from farms scattered bout like seed and sometimes in the evening that old donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding gold in river mud. Sometimes the Lord he shows mercy even to them that aint looking for it.",
            "Ten years gone now since we come to this place. Memory stands like a weathered post in dry earth. First days was hard. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge with nothing but tears and the hollow ache of leaving behind what was known and loved. Mama and daddy they wanted better for me and my sister both. Better houses, better schools. A place where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nTime passed like water over stone. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange excepting Mr. Glen and his young ones, and Dennis who lived beside. Good folk. Like blood kin almost. I mind the time we all went to Mr. Glen's wedding, him getting hitched again. Something pure in that gathering. Something that spoke to what I wanted someday when I'd made my way in the world. Ms. Veda throwing that white garter and me catching it like it was sent by God himself. Though the flowers, they escaped me.\n\nWe danced that night. All of us. Marsharii, his daughter, moving like wind through summer grass. Ain't seen her since. World takes people where it will.\n\nThe neighborhood lies like a maze of streets and shadows, though now technology guides where once was only guesswork. Walked those streets with Kason and Curtis, gaming and laughing like boys do when the world ain't yet showed its teeth. Sometimes I'd go alone to the park where nature speaks in tongues older than words. Practice with sticks from the hardware store, testing balance like them old samurai. Carry my wooden sword too sometimes. Basketball court and tennis court stand empty now but memory holds the sound of balls hitting strings, daddy and Mr. Graves teaching what they knew of the game.\n\nTime moves like wind through dead grass. Stories pile up like autumn leaves. But the best ones, they ain't been lived yet. They wait out there in the dark, patient as hunger.",
            "The town aint much to look at. Just another dot on the map of South Carolina but it feeds more folk than youd reckon. Johnston they call it. Peach Capital of the World painted proud on a sign weathered by sun and time. The land spreads out like a quilt of orchards and pastures, peach trees standing sentinel over cattle that graze in the heat haze.\n\nHouses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming like mercury under the merciless southern sun or gray shingles dark as thunderheads. Fields stretch between them like a sea of green, livestock and crops claiming dominion over the earth. In town theres one stoplight swaying above a crossroads like a hanged man, marking where commerce tries to take root in this soil.\n\nThree places to eat if youre of a mind. Hong Kong run by a family who keeps to themselves, the Mexican place called Fiesta, and Garys where burgers slide off the griddle day and night. The pizza joint gave up its ghost not long past. Maxwell and Halford still stands, selling medicine and cherry cola that folks swear by like its holy water. IGA charges dear for groceries but folk mostly drive to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, leaving IGA for desperate times. Dollar General rules over all, packed from dawn till dusk with bodies seeking cheap necessities.\n\nThe furniture store called Possibilities sits like an aging matron, run by a woman everybody knows but nobody really knows. Two men haul her wares across town in a truck thats seen better days. Next door the pet shop tends to animals with more care than some show their kin.\n\nDoctor and vet both keep to the outskirts, small operations but enough to keep body and beast going. One school takes the young ones till they're old enough to bus to the next town over. No parks save whats coming - two and a half acres of promised recreation that may or may not save this place from its own quiet death.\n\nNo picture shows or bowling alleys or places for young blood to spill their restless energy. No paths for dogs to trot or children to play. Just a town small enough to miss in a blink, hanging on to its patch of earth like its the last place God remembered to make.",
            "We live here where the two highways meet and cross like veins in the earth, the traffic passing like blood through arteries ancient and eternal. Tennessee. A small town where the houses stand like sentinels against time itself. The neighbors we know by their shadows and their ways, their coming and going like the tide, predictable and constant. They work their yards with quiet determination, pushing mowers across patches of green that nature never intended, burning leaves in the fall like ritual fires of old.\n\nThe house stands at the corner where we watch them all pass. Four souls dwelling within. Me. The wife. Two daughters with ages marked by time like rings in a tree. Eleven. Fourteen. The seasons pass here like they always have. Winter brings the children sliding down the hill on the side street, their laughter echoing off the empty trees. Spring brings the mowers, their mechanical drone a constant companion from March till October when the grass finally surrenders to the cold.\n\nThe trees. They were here first. Their shadows fall across our lives like memories of a wilder time. Their leaves come down in autumn, golden and brown, to be gathered and burned in smoky offerings to the sky. These days winter comes less and less, like an old friend growing distant, leaving only the long autumn to remind us of what was.\n\nThe garage sits back from the house like a afterthought, doors open to the neighborhood when I work on the truck, metal on metal, grease and rust and time wearing away at all things. Holidays bring the strangers, kin to the neighbors, their cars lining the streets like metal insects at rest. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and go like seasons themselves.\n\nThrough it all the traffic flows past our corner, an endless river of metal and purpose, marking this place as something less than perfect but more than nothing. A testament to what we've built here in this carved-out space between the wild and the tame.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast brown carpet laid down by God himself, dirt and more dirt far as the eye can see. Brown everywhere and when you spot a patch of green you know some fool's burning money like kindling just to keep it that way. Back in the nineties the houses stood lonely and far apart like sentinels in the wasteland but now they've bred and multiplied though the spaces between them still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like some restless beast consuming the earth day by day. Good folk and bad folk both dwell here same as anywhere else though round my part it's mostly old timers, quiet and neighborly. Chain stores squat on corners like concrete toads, Food for Less and Smart and Final, but nothing fancy. You want that kind of shopping you got to drive and drive far.\n\nConstruction work rules these parts. Men with calloused hands and sun-leathered faces raising walls where once there was nothing. I'm one of them. Drywall and T-bar's my trade. The empty spaces call out to be filled but something in me wishes they'd stay empty. Left the big city behind and ain't keen on watching it follow me here.\n\nThe wildlife though. That's something else entirely. Creatures that crawl and slither and scurry across this unforgiving land, making homes where most would see nothing but death. My young ones, they're drawn to it like moths to flame. Out there now hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen, their small hands reaching into the mysteries of the ancient earth.\n\nThe county fair comes once a year like some traveling carnival of souls, bringing noise and light to the quiet desert. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like old men wear white beards, and down in the museum they keep pieces of the dead world - bones and stones and artifacts that whisper stories of what was here before. Stories of people who lived and died in this same dirt, under this same merciless sun. The high desert takes no prisoners but it gives up its secrets slow, one grain of sand at a time.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete kingdom, all angles and shadows and the long dark corridors between buildings where fluorescent lights hum eternal. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like what most folk would tell of. No picket fences here. No soccer moms in minivans. Just dormitories rising up like ancient monoliths and the perpetual migration of young souls between them.\n\nThe buildings stand testament to different tribes. Apartments where two or four souls share the confined spaces like monks in their cells, stacked two floors high with twenty bodies per structure. Then there's the houses, old weathered things scattered like afterthoughts across campus, where them that's graduated sometimes return to roost. Alumni they call them, though they might as well be ghosts of what came before. But it's the dormitories that hold the masses, great concrete beehives where hundreds sleep two by two in rooms no bigger than prison cells, though they don't see it that way.\n\nThe people here are like colors in some mad painter's palette, mixed and blended till you can't tell where one ends and another begins. Professional staff in their houses like lords in their manors, fresh-faced students in their dormitory caves, the older ones graduated to their apartment kingdoms. They come from everywhere and nowhere, bearing names that sound like music or warfare or both.\n\nThe stores stand like outposts in this academic wilderness. Places to eat, places to buy books and clothes emblazoned with school colors like tribal markings. A grocery that sells everything and nothing you need. And there's the park, a single green lung in this concrete body, kept pristine by some unspoken covenant between all who dwell here. At night it lies empty save for the occasional wanderer, during day it fills with the sounds of life, though what kind of life depends on who's telling the tale.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood, but it's mine all the same. A world contained within walls, bordered by learning and youth and the eternal cycle of coming and going. Some might call it strange but they don't understand. This here is a civilization all its own, complete as any other, more honest than most.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set his hand against it and pushed, and we live where the tilt begins, atop what folk call the workout hill on account of the joggers who come daily to test themselves against its grade. They walk in the road for there aint no other place to walk, the asphalt pocked and scarred like an old man's face. Above them the wires hang in webs, patched and mended from countless storms, a testimony to man's endless war with weather and wind.\n\nThe trees stand sentinel. Great evergreens that pierce the sky like spears, though the people here curse them and bring them down with saw and axe, for they block what all come here seeking - the ocean view. Houses rise like watchtowers, glass-faced and hungry for the sight of water, stacked one above the other in their greed for the horizon. When the sun sets the water burns like molten copper beneath a sky gone orange and raw, though most days the light filters weak through a gauze of clouds that never seems to lift.\n\nThe moss claims everything. It creeps and spreads with a patience older than time, turning roofs and rails and forgotten automobiles to fuzzy green monuments of neglect. Children are scarce here despite the schoolhouse that squats empty mere blocks away. The old folks have inherited this place, and with them came their dogs. The beasts roam like they own the streets, slipping through open doors uninvited, making themselves at home in stranger's houses like thieves who want nothing but company.\n\nRabbits too, big as cats, their burrows pockmarking lawns like shotgun holes. The gardeners wage their own private war against them, but it's the housecats that are winning, turning the neighborhood into their private hunting grounds. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds like floating jewels, and sometimes a hawk or eagle until the crows drive them off with their black wings and darker purpose.\n\nDown the hill where the land gives way to water there are places that serve up what the bay provides. No proper beach exists there, just rocks that wait to be thrown into the grey waters. The opposite shore looms close enough to touch through the eternal mist, like a promise just out of reach.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some sprawling beast in Brooklyn's belly, its streets a maze of iron and concrete where the subway cars screech their arrival like metal prophets. The neighborhood breathes with the pulse of the city yet maintains its own heartbeat, its own truth.\n\nIn recent years the Asians had come. Their stores now stand sentinel on every block, bright signs in foreign scripts marking their territory like totems. Markets and laundries mostly. Good places. Clean places. The locals know this and come in droves, their footsteps wearing smooth paths on the concrete, their dollars changing hands in these temples of commerce. Where I stand now you could throw a stone and hit four such markets, though that aint advisable.\n\nThe place aint purely Asian though. Its got layers like old paint, each wave of immigrants leaving their mark. First generation, second generation, all of them carrying their histories like invisible baggage. The park nearby is new-made, steel and concrete rising from old earth. Basketball courts spread out like a giant's gaming board, soccer fields stretched green and endless, handball courts standing like ancient ruins. Children play in the water fountains come summer, their laughter a counterpoint to the city's drone.\n\nNo towers of commerce cast their shadows here. Just the squat buildings of the working folk, mostly two-family affairs with their own histories written in brick and mortar. The people here got their own music, blasting from cars at all hours like some mechanical orchestra tuned to chaos. The engines roar their midnight symphonies, sleep be damned.\n\nNight brings its own rules. The darkness carries dangers old as time - thieves and bullies and men who'd hurt you just to pass the time. I knew their kind once, felt their fists. These days they steal packages from porches, modern-day bandits with no honor to speak of.\n\nAnd everywhere the dogs leave their offerings, city ordinances be damned. Their waste dots the sidewalks like some primitive trail markers, forcing pedestrians into an eternal dance of avoidance. The city's laws mean nothing to the dogs or their masters. That's the truth of it. That's Bensonhurst.",
            "You got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon fore you can understand anything else. Theres this word painted up on the wall of some building where they serve pizza and beer and music and naked women dancing and half of what goes on there aint strictly speaking legal but the word just says Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the darkness. Some folk say its about remembering how things was back before the money came. Others say its like a beacon calling out to them that dont fit nowhere else saying come here where your strangeness is a blessing not a curse.\n\nThe Californians keep coming. Rich ones mostly. The cranes keep turning, building towers of glass and steel to house them all but the weird persists like some old god that wont die. Not that weird means kind exactly. More like it means tolerating what other places wont abide. We still got our Walmarts and our Chinese goods same as anywhere. Got our share of normal too. Yoga studios. Hipsters drinking coffee. Men in suits walking fast to nowhere.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses wear colors like carnival clothes and gardens grow wild along the streets, herbs and flowers pushing up through cracks in the concrete. Come summer theres these boxes appear. Free boxes we call them. Cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic bags or wooden crates. They got this magic about them. Like offerings to some pagan god of refuse and recycling. Clothes mostly. Books. Sometimes stranger things. Walking these streets is like walking through some dream where anything might happen.\n\nBut thats just my kind of weird. Theres thousands of kinds here. Some folk wouldnt touch nothing from a sidewalk box but theyll do yoga with goats - real goats mind you - or scream themselves hoarse at soccer matches. Everyone here loves something fierce.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray clouds hanging low like wet wool and with them comes the darkness in peoples minds. We got our share of them that cant cope. Them that turn to drugs or end up sleeping rough. The city tries to help but its never enough. Never is anywhere. The rest of us we swing between wanting to help and wanting them gone and in that we aint weird at all. Just human. Same as anywhere else.",
            "They stood there always. North. Silent watchers of the sun's ancient passage across the heavens. Days would pass and the mind would forget but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Uncaring of man's trivial sufferings. And in moments when the spirit lay broken they'd call out with their voiceless song and the weary soul would turn to them and draw strength from their ageless presence. One day and then the next.\n\nThe university sprawled below them like some great beast at rest. Buildings of stone and concrete rose from manicured lawns where ponds reflected the sky. But the mountains ruled over all. The town spread out in patterns of brick and mortar, cafes where students gathered with their books and their coffee cups like supplicants before some caffeine altar. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks weathered and stained by time, telling tales of commerce and industry. Here the small town pretended at greatness, mimicking its urban neighbor until the facade crumbled at the library's edge where quiet returned like an old friend.\n\nThe city was two things at once. Urban and rural. Busy and peaceful. As if god himself couldn't decide what to make of it. Memories collected in its corners like dust. Some sweet as honey, others bitter as grave dirt. Friends laughing past rusted playground equipment in the dark hours. Mad dashes through crowded streets to catch some picture show in a theater too fine for such as them. And the ponds. The ponds watched it all. Witnessed tears falling at ungodly hours while turtles and waterfowl went about their appointed rounds, each creature knowing its place while man alone wandered lost.\n\nPast houses that could've been anywhere in America the walker moved northward where palm trees caught the first light like torches. And there they stood. Mountains old as time itself scraping at the dawn sky with their jagged fingers. Speaking without voice. Teaching without words. Enduring. Always enduring.",
            "Youd miss it if you werent looking. Just houses behind some storefronts like any other place where folk dont mean to live but do anyway. Past the husk of what was once a Whole Foods and behind them hotels that stand empty save summer reunions theres a whole world breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like broken matryoshka dolls laid out careful and deliberate by some giant hand. First ones got stories in the papers. Bad stories. But we dont speak on those cause sometimes evil just is what it is and sometimes it aint.\n\nThe other buildings though. They stand different. Unknown to most who pass through here like ghosts in the night. Cross the way theres a school where kids come to learn what the world already beat into their parents. Iron gates groan like ancient things and cars stack up while drivers curse the morning and their coffee goes cold. The road dies at another, park on one side and a place where broken people come to get fixed on the other. Got wicker chairs out front and a fan that just pushes the thick summer air around like God stirring soup.\n\nChildren spin in the grass like windmills made of flesh and bone while bees work the flowers like they always have and always will. Old folk walk dogs and eye the young ones suspicious, them with their boards and their clouds of sweet poison they breathe in thinking it makes them something more than what they are. Girls gather like birds on playground steel talking about whatever girls talk about these days while the world spins on without them.\n\nStrip mall stands sentinel. Sushi place never full but always there. Pool store. Nail shop. All of it lined up like markers on a grave. You could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish from the sea. The frozen yogurt place draws them young ones like flies to honey. They congregate with their plastic cups full of sugar and dreams, performing their rituals of youth while vapor trails follow them like ghosts of futures not yet lost. This here's a piece of the South that time forgot or maybe just chose to pass by, leaving it preserved like a bug in amber, waiting for something that aint never gonna come.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels in rows unending. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames like conjoined twins that cannot part. Mine sits quiet with its patch of earth before it and the narrow strip of concrete where the automobiles rest. These dwellings whisper tales of times when suburban life was the dream that all men carried in their hearts like scripture. That dream now fades like evening light across the western sky but these neighborhoods persist, testament to what was and what might still be.\n\nThe people here carry themselves differently now. The yards grow wild where once they were maintained with religious fervor. Yet automobiles still mark each house like tribal tokens and children play in the streets as if the world beyond held no meaning. The schoolhouse stands nine decades strong, a brick fortress where futures are forged while memories gather like dust in its corners. Churches stand empty save for ghosts of prayers long spoken while young men gather at basketball courts, their voices carrying across empty streets like coyote songs.\n\nThe houses wear different faces but their souls are cast from the same mold. There's a market run by Yemeni folk, Arabs alone in this sea of black faces. The streets stretch wide like rivers of asphalt where young boys play at football, scattering like quail when cars approach. Most folk here have roots deep as live oaks, their stories passed down like family bibles, speaking of times when neighbor knew neighbor and doors stayed unlocked against the night.\n\nWhere once stood a karate school now stands a pharmacy, testament to how dreams change shape like clouds across the sky. The movie house remains, showing pictures from yesteryear at prices that make the old folks smile while young ones pass it by like they pass by all things that speak of older times. The expressway runs past but never touches our town, kept at bay by elders who saw in its concrete arteries the death of something precious that cannot be named. They build a new school now and talk of mascots, as if such things could capture the spirit of a place where past and future war like ancient enemies seeking peace.",
            "The city stretches vast and merciless like some great concrete leviathan, its innards a maze of commerce and dwelling places strewn about with neither reason nor purpose save the blind machinations of progress. Streets wind between the buildings housing their merchants and their wares, some bearing names known across the land and others small nameless places where men scratch out their living in the shadow of corporate giants. The parks stand as green islands in this gray sea where children play while their mothers watch with tired eyes beneath the smog-stained sky.\n\nThe people here they come from everywhere and nowhere. They cluster in their tribes like primitive societies of old. The queers and the orthodox Jews and the Russians all carved out their territories in this urban wilderness, and beyond them lie the other kingdoms - Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia - all of them pressing against each other like tectonic plates threatening to crack and split the earth beneath.\n\nNobody walks here. They sit in their metal coffins burning fuel and cursing god while the sun crawls across the sky. Ten miles might as well be a hundred. Two hours to traverse what a man could walk in three, the roads glutted with machines stacked bumper to bumper like cattle in some hellish stockyard. And still they come. The builders raise their towers of glass and steel higher and higher toward heaven while the old residents watch and mutter dark prophecies about the coming times.\n\nHouses stand like relics from another age. Single dwellings and duplexes and little boxes stacked atop one another where families make their homes. But there aint no real community no more. Just strangers passing strangers in the night. Sometimes I remember the children I once knew who played in these streets, their laughter echoing off walls that now stand silent as tombstones in this concrete graveyard we call home.",
            "Where is it all, she said. The girl's eyes swept across the endless rows of corn that stretched like soldiers to the horizon. This is all there is, I told her. She'd never known such vastness. Where she came from the markets were close and the buildings pressed in around you like teeth. But here there was only space and sky and the stalks that moved like waves in the wind.\n\nWe drove on. The road was black and straight and empty save for the occasional rust-worn truck that passed like a ghost. I told her of my youth in this land. This Ohio. This place of dirt and seasons and silence. Past the flooded quarry where the water lay dark and still we came to the houses. Brick and stucco dwellings set back from the road on plots of grass kept neat as cemetery plots. German cars gleamed in driveways like alien artifacts.\n\nThe Korean lived there still. Ancient now but dedicated to his rituals of grass-cutting. His singing carried across the lawns, a counterpoint to the engine's drone. Once he'd been a healer of men but time had taken that from him like it takes all things. Now he was just a figure in the landscape, merged with his machine, both of them fading.\n\nMy house stood grey against the sky. The geese came and went like temporal things, harried by the small dog that lived to chase them. Behind the house the creek muttered its endless song, punctuated by bullfrogs and the low complaints of distant cattle. Across the wooden bridge we'd built lay wilderness. Real wilderness. Not the managed kind but the true sort where things grew as they would and died when they must.\n\nI'd spent my childhood there among those trees. Building shelters from found things. Stalking creatures that knew we meant them no harm. Other children came and went like phases of the moon.\n\nWinter transformed it all. The green world died and was reborn as something stark and pure. Trees that had blazed with color stood naked against the white sky. Snow came in the night like judgment, turning the known world strange. My sister and I built fortifications from ice and armed ourselves with frozen ammunition. We fought our small wars and made our peace and lay in the snow to leave the shapes of angels. We were timeless then. We were children and that was all we needed to be."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the land stretches out between farms and them tourist towns like a blanket pulled taut across the earth. Ain't no malls here. No big box stores with their fluorescent glow. No chain restaurants neither. Everything's a drive. But Lord if it ain't the most beautiful country you ever saw. Water everywhere. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, like twin mirrors held up to the sky. Beaches scattered like loose change, waiting for feet to find them.\n\nThe neighborhood sits like something out of time. Houses don't crowd each other none. Each one different from the last, wearing their years like badges. Some fixed up nice, others showing their age plain as day. Got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the Michigan soil. Aluminum siding gone silver with time. Colors everywhere, like God himself took to painting with whatever was left in his palette.\n\nYards spread wide. Children's things scattered about - trampolines reaching for sky, swing sets creaking in the wind. Gardens where folks grow what they can. Fences holding animals that ain't wild but ain't quite tame neither. These houses speak of work. Hard work. The kind that wears a body down but builds a life up.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things. Dogs and their people making their rounds. Bikes and skates on worn concrete. Folks know who belongs and who don't, like animals knowing their own kind. Someone's always cooking outside, smoke rising up like prayers. Wave to them and they wave back, caught in this dance of neighborly recognition.\n\nThe grass stays cut. Dead leaves don't linger. Bushes stand neat and trimmed like soldiers. Ain't nothing fancy here, but there's something true about it. Something that whispers home and safety and peace.\n\nGot the law close by, sheriff and his jail. Health department too. Recycling center humming with purpose. Baseball fields where voices carry across summer evenings, calling out names like roll call at church. Airport nearby, small planes growling overhead like metal birds.\n\nIce cream place within walking distance. Downtown too, if your legs are willing. Park eight blocks distant, where children pedal their bikes like pilgrims to sacred ground. This here's a good place. Real good place. The kind of place where a soul might rest and not feel the need to run no more.",
            "The houses stand like teeth in perfect rows, all cut from the same bone-white clay, all bearing the mark of some unseen hand that moves across this land with ruler and measure. The HOA they call it. A covenant written in bylaws and regulations that binds these dwellings in their uniformity. Each yard a testament to man's need to tame nature - patches of grass cut low like military haircuts, stones laid in geometric patterns, saplings that stand like prisoners awaiting judgment. Two-car garages yawn their dark mouths at the street.\n\nThe roads here are black and perfect, unmarred by time or elements, as if laid down yesterday and preserved in amber. No potholes mar these streets. The houses crouch low to the ground mostly, though some rear up two stories high like watchtowers in this domestic fortress. There aint no mailboxes standing sentry at each drive like you might expect. They cluster together at the street's end in metal arrays, all locked away behind little doors with little keys, like safety deposit boxes in some bank of correspondence.\n\nThis land sits at the edge of the city like a frontier outpost, where suburban order gives way to rural chaos. They built pools here, community pools with high fences and gates that click shut with the sound of security. Walking trails wind through the wildness beyond, paths beaten into submission by countless feet. You could run these streets for hours and never cross your own path twice.\n\nThe old folks claim most of this territory, their retirement dreams made manifest in stucco and tile. They watch. They wait. They tend their gardens with mechanical precision. Mixed among them are the younger ones, professionals with briefcases and schedules, marking time until they too grow old here.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own life, vast in numbers but somehow still carrying the heart of a small town in its concrete chest. Fifteen minutes drive through the arterial roads leads to the commerce - one mall standing like a cathedral to consumption, grocery stores both fancy and plain, outlets stripped bare of pretense where fluorescent lights hum their endless hymn over empty aisles. All the chains are here, their logos burning against the sky like modern totems. This is what we built here, what we maintain with our rules and our watching. This is civilization carved out of chaos, all clean lines and right angles, all safety and sameness stretching toward the horizon.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through digital ether like spectres. Strange thing to hear. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each turning of the moon and none I knew had heard such tales. Maybe it's the struggle that takes them. Some weep in their beds come nightfall, I know this. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it, learned to love the must of old toys and clothes hung dead in closets like preserved saints. Your nose dulls with the years. Might be the cigarettes or might be just the way of things but the fleamarket smell always wins out. Adulthood smells like magazines gone yellow on a piano that ain't been opened since God knows when. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking. Start at the far end and you can make your way through charity shops and libraries and places selling old books and curiosities like relics in a church of commerce. Downtown's thick with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like blood through veins but in the thrift stores there ain't no sound at all. Good place to lose yourself. More people come each year, more machines of steel and glass. They call it development. Some big digital empire planted its flag here and the city groans with growing like a child with fever. Makes me think of New York. Everyone got their own purpose and nobody asks nothing of nobody. You can wrap yourself in silence like a shroud and ain't nobody going to unwrap you. Not like down South where concern is currency. Here you keep your secrets and the city rolls past like waves on sand, eternal and uncaring.\n\nLife moves though. Got a pianist next door and singers above, their voices carrying through walls thin as paper. Ain't so much strangers sharing walls as people sharing life. We come together when need calls, mark births and deaths and help each other through the dark times. Lucky, I reckon. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food, carry mail like offerings between temples. They seem to like having me here and I like having them. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make it feel less like I went and ruined everything.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a collection of weatherbeaten structures that stand like forgotten sentinels in the midwestern dust. Here on the eastern edge where the poorest souls gather, where paint peels from clapboard sidings and screen doors hang askew, there exists a kind of truth that money cannot purchase. The people here nod and smile, their faces etched with stories untold, walking these streets like pilgrims in some forgotten ceremony.\n\nViolence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome prophet. Gunshots have rung out in the night. Blood has stained these streets. The neighbors boy, not yet twenty, fell outside a barroom last year, his life seeping into concrete while moths danced around the neon signs. We've lost souls to the white powder too, that modern plague that comes in little bags and leaves bodies in its wake like autumn leaves. The town fathers have built places for healing, dispensing orange bottles of hope and teaching folks how to bring back the dead with clear liquid in syringes.\n\nThe school stands like a fortress of childhood, a place where my boy goes each morning, different from the others but accepted all the same. They feed them there, all of them, no questions asked, no money changed. The teachers move through their days like saints in some secular religion, tending to the children of the poor and the children of those who have more than enough, making no distinction between them.\n\nWest of us the town preens itself, new asphalt gleaming in the sun, fresh paint and trimmed trees marking territory like some primitive boundary line. Our side remains raw, untended, true. Sixteen years we've walked these streets, lived in these walls, watched the seasons pass like migrating birds. The house aint much but it holds our breath and our dreams and that's enough. Some truths dont need explaining and some places mark you for their own and that's how it is here, in this town that most folks would pass through without a second glance, not knowing what they missed.",
            "The hill rises like some ancient god's throne, crowned with buildings that whisper tales of time gone past. Seven stories up I dwell, the old Theater house standing sentinel across the way, its weathered facade a testament to forgotten performances. Down the slope there's a place where games sing their electronic hymns and beer flows like communion wine, drawing pilgrims of all breeds when summer lays heavy on the land.\n\nThe park stretches vast against the urban sprawl, bordered by concrete walls where steps rise like the vertebrae of some buried beast. Winter brings the wanderers, their nylon shelters lined in rows precise as headstones, huddled against the rain that falls eternal in these parts. Not snow but water, endless water that seeps into bones and souls alike. They cluster together like wolves in the heart of the city, far from the wild places they call the jungle, seeking warmth in numbers and proximity to salvation - a family center where steam rises from showers like prayers.\n\nBut it aint the stone and mortar that speaks to me. Aint the architectural majesty scattered across these hills that roll down toward the great dark water. It's the blood memory of this place. Hilltop. A name that once carried death in its syllables, when gangs ruled these streets like warlords of old. Federal men came through like locusts, badges gleaming, guns drawn. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like myself who come seeking something raw and true.\n\nWhite folks say don't walk these streets after dark. Words born of fear and ignorance, echoing from times when hatred wore different masks. Maybe it's my skin, dark enough to pass, or maybe these streets know their own - those who understand the weight of history, the poison of prejudice that still seeps through the nation's foundations.\n\nThis hill, this home, pulses with life when darkness falls. Strangers offer warmth without warrant, laundry keepers extend mercy in minutes, concrete becomes shelter. Here I've sat invisible against shop fronts while grey skies weep, only to be seen, truly seen, by those who know that beauty and worth hide in unexpected places. They press crumpled bills into palms like secular blessings, their words a benediction in the gathering dark.",
            "I come to this place in the eighth grade of my schooling, a time when childhood bleeds into something darker and less forgiving. The houses stood like sentinels in the gathering dusk, two stories high and identical in their suburban uniformity. Two boys lived nearby then, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, both gone now but their ghosts remain, haunting the sidewalks where we once walked.\n\nThe people who first dwelt here when I arrived still persist, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the neighborhood like ancient threads in some vast tapestry. Children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. Most days pass in silence. The inhabitants keep to themselves save in times of need, like creatures in some unspoken covenant.\n\nThere's a park nearby, no more than a minute's walk through territory I've known since youth. Basketball hoops stand like gallows against the sky, witness to countless games played out in dust and sweat. Once took an elbow to the nose there, blood running hot and copper-tasting down my chin, but such wounds heal and memory has a way of favoring the good over the bad. Now I watch my cousin's children there, small things drawn to swings and slides like moths to flame, their joy pure and unweathered by time.\n\nThe streets around here speak in many tongues. Chinese food and Indian spices and Mexican corn, all of it mingling in the air like some strange communion. People don't walk much anymore though, preferring to summon their sustenance through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints squat on corners like toads, identical to every other suburb in this vast country. The stores stand shoulder to shoulder: Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco, names repeated across a thousand similar streets in a thousand similar towns.\n\nI've read tales of neighbor turning against neighbor, dark stories that bloom like nightshade across social media and evening news. But here we abide by older rules, simpler ones. Packages rest unmolested on porches. Children play without fear. And in the gathering dark, porch lights wink on one by one, like stars in some earthbound constellation.",
            "The college stands near where I lay my head and for this I am grateful though I know not why. Row upon row of weathered buildings line these streets like ancient sentinels, their facades telling stories of time's slow march. Bars and eateries dot the landscape like waystations in some urban exodus, their neon signs casting strange shadows across the crumbling concrete. They renamed one such establishment not long past, its prices now steep as cemetery walls though the spirits flow just the same.\n\nThe people here exist in a kind of limbo between academia and poverty, their lives intersecting in strange geometries. Children ghost these streets in the daylight hours, drawn to the schoolhouse that squats among the apartment blocks. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how I prefer it, though their herbal proclivities have prompted management to wage a futile war with industrial fresheners, a comedy that plays out in the narrow hallway like some absurdist theater.\n\nAncient buildings shoulder up against one another, their innards gutted and remade while their faces remain unchanged. Down the road stand newer structures, false prophets of luxury built on foundations of sand and greed, their high rents a testament to man's capacity for deception. A diner serves microwaved sustenance on paper plates like some post-apocalyptic café, while across the way a gas station stands sentinel, its fluorescent lights humming stories of minimum wage desperation.\n\nThe city's money brought new concrete and grass, as if nature could be purchased and planted like fence posts. Trees crowd my building like mourners at a wake, their stumps testament to some arboreal massacre. Behind us lies 43rd street, a darker mirror of our own, where broken sidewalks tell tales of neglect and shabby buildings hide behind leafy curtains. Crime moves through these streets like water, finding the path of least resistance, flowing from one complex to another without prejudice or pattern.\n\nYet I remain, tethered by economics and convenience to this place where university buses ferry the hopeful to and fro, and where my feet can carry me from home to classroom without need for mechanical intervention. It is a place of contradictions, of decay and renewal, of transience and permanence, and it is, for now at least, home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses scattered round the deadend road like dice thrown by some vagrant god. Folk here they know each other mostly. Stand in driveways come evening time talking bout nothing and everything while young uns mark the concrete with chalk colors or chase kites against the fading sky. Like time done stopped here. Like the world outside with its machines and gleaming screens cant touch this place. Fields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up against a sky so blue it hurts and clouds drift like lost sheep across the heavens.\n\nThen the sirens come. Wailing like souls damned in the darkness. Storm bells ringing out cross the land and we all scattered like quail to our holes. Me I took to the bathtub with the little dog trembling in my arms, purse and pillows clutched like talismans against the coming dark. The big dog wouldnt come. Just stood in the living room barking at demons he couldnt see. Then the hail come. Great chunks of ice hammering the earth like judgment day. When it passed the road steamed like some creature breathing in the night. Temperature dropped seventeen degrees like God turned down the thermostat. Ice melted soon as it touched ground hot enough to fry eggs on. Then the sun broke through and rain fell all at once and two rainbows stretched across the sky like bridges to somewhere else.\n\nThis place it aint like New Hampshire where I come from. Two bedrooms two baths in each unit but they aint all the same inside despite what you might reckon looking at em. I walk the field out back sometimes down to where the pond sits still as glass. Deer move through there like ghosts and mornings the bullfrog sings his ancient song. Forty minutes from Charlotte but might as well be another world. Roosters call out each dawn from farms scattered bout like seed and sometimes in the evening that old donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding gold in river mud. Sometimes the Lord he shows mercy even to them that aint looking for it.",
            "Ten years gone now since we come to this place. Memory stands like a weathered post in dry earth. First days was hard. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge with nothing but tears and the hollow ache of leaving behind what was known and loved. Mama and daddy they wanted better for me and my sister both. Better houses, better schools. A place where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nTime passed like water over stone. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange excepting Mr. Glen and his young ones, and Dennis who lived beside. Good folk. Like blood kin almost. I mind the time we all went to Mr. Glen's wedding, him getting hitched again. Something pure in that gathering. Something that spoke to what I wanted someday when I'd made my way in the world. Ms. Veda throwing that white garter and me catching it like it was sent by God himself. Though the flowers, they escaped me.\n\nWe danced that night. All of us. Marsharii, his daughter, moving like wind through summer grass. Ain't seen her since. World takes people where it will.\n\nThe neighborhood lies like a maze of streets and shadows, though now technology guides where once was only guesswork. Walked those streets with Kason and Curtis, gaming and laughing like boys do when the world ain't yet showed its teeth. Sometimes I'd go alone to the park where nature speaks in tongues older than words. Practice with sticks from the hardware store, testing balance like them old samurai. Carry my wooden sword too sometimes. Basketball court and tennis court stand empty now but memory holds the sound of balls hitting strings, daddy and Mr. Graves teaching what they knew of the game.\n\nTime moves like wind through dead grass. Stories pile up like autumn leaves. But the best ones, they ain't been lived yet. They wait out there in the dark, patient as hunger.",
            "The town aint much to look at. Just another dot on the map of South Carolina but it feeds more folk than youd reckon. Johnston they call it. Peach Capital of the World painted proud on a sign weathered by sun and time. The land spreads out like a quilt of orchards and pastures, peach trees standing sentinel over cattle that graze in the heat haze.\n\nHouses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming like mercury under the merciless southern sun or gray shingles dark as thunderheads. Fields stretch between them like a sea of green, livestock and crops claiming dominion over the earth. In town theres one stoplight swaying above a crossroads like a hanged man, marking where commerce tries to take root in this soil.\n\nThree places to eat if youre of a mind. Hong Kong run by a family who keeps to themselves, the Mexican place called Fiesta, and Garys where burgers slide off the griddle day and night. The pizza joint gave up its ghost not long past. Maxwell and Halford still stands, selling medicine and cherry cola that folks swear by like its holy water. IGA charges dear for groceries but folk mostly drive to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, leaving IGA for desperate times. Dollar General rules over all, packed from dawn till dusk with bodies seeking cheap necessities.\n\nThe furniture store called Possibilities sits like an aging matron, run by a woman everybody knows but nobody really knows. Two men haul her wares across town in a truck thats seen better days. Next door the pet shop tends to animals with more care than some show their kin.\n\nDoctor and vet both keep to the outskirts, small operations but enough to keep body and beast going. One school takes the young ones till they're old enough to bus to the next town over. No parks save whats coming - two and a half acres of promised recreation that may or may not save this place from its own quiet death.\n\nNo picture shows or bowling alleys or places for young blood to spill their restless energy. No paths for dogs to trot or children to play. Just a town small enough to miss in a blink, hanging on to its patch of earth like its the last place God remembered to make.",
            "We live here where the two highways meet and cross like veins in the earth, the traffic passing like blood through arteries ancient and eternal. Tennessee. A small town where the houses stand like sentinels against time itself. The neighbors we know by their shadows and their ways, their coming and going like the tide, predictable and constant. They work their yards with quiet determination, pushing mowers across patches of green that nature never intended, burning leaves in the fall like ritual fires of old.\n\nThe house stands at the corner where we watch them all pass. Four souls dwelling within. Me. The wife. Two daughters with ages marked by time like rings in a tree. Eleven. Fourteen. The seasons pass here like they always have. Winter brings the children sliding down the hill on the side street, their laughter echoing off the empty trees. Spring brings the mowers, their mechanical drone a constant companion from March till October when the grass finally surrenders to the cold.\n\nThe trees. They were here first. Their shadows fall across our lives like memories of a wilder time. Their leaves come down in autumn, golden and brown, to be gathered and burned in smoky offerings to the sky. These days winter comes less and less, like an old friend growing distant, leaving only the long autumn to remind us of what was.\n\nThe garage sits back from the house like a afterthought, doors open to the neighborhood when I work on the truck, metal on metal, grease and rust and time wearing away at all things. Holidays bring the strangers, kin to the neighbors, their cars lining the streets like metal insects at rest. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and go like seasons themselves.\n\nThrough it all the traffic flows past our corner, an endless river of metal and purpose, marking this place as something less than perfect but more than nothing. A testament to what we've built here in this carved-out space between the wild and the tame.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast brown carpet laid down by God himself, dirt and more dirt far as the eye can see. Brown everywhere and when you spot a patch of green you know some fool's burning money like kindling just to keep it that way. Back in the nineties the houses stood lonely and far apart like sentinels in the wasteland but now they've bred and multiplied though the spaces between them still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like some restless beast consuming the earth day by day. Good folk and bad folk both dwell here same as anywhere else though round my part it's mostly old timers, quiet and neighborly. Chain stores squat on corners like concrete toads, Food for Less and Smart and Final, but nothing fancy. You want that kind of shopping you got to drive and drive far.\n\nConstruction work rules these parts. Men with calloused hands and sun-leathered faces raising walls where once there was nothing. I'm one of them. Drywall and T-bar's my trade. The empty spaces call out to be filled but something in me wishes they'd stay empty. Left the big city behind and ain't keen on watching it follow me here.\n\nThe wildlife though. That's something else entirely. Creatures that crawl and slither and scurry across this unforgiving land, making homes where most would see nothing but death. My young ones, they're drawn to it like moths to flame. Out there now hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen, their small hands reaching into the mysteries of the ancient earth.\n\nThe county fair comes once a year like some traveling carnival of souls, bringing noise and light to the quiet desert. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like old men wear white beards, and down in the museum they keep pieces of the dead world - bones and stones and artifacts that whisper stories of what was here before. Stories of people who lived and died in this same dirt, under this same merciless sun. The high desert takes no prisoners but it gives up its secrets slow, one grain of sand at a time.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete kingdom, all angles and shadows and the long dark corridors between buildings where fluorescent lights hum eternal. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like what most folk would tell of. No picket fences here. No soccer moms in minivans. Just dormitories rising up like ancient monoliths and the perpetual migration of young souls between them.\n\nThe buildings stand testament to different tribes. Apartments where two or four souls share the confined spaces like monks in their cells, stacked two floors high with twenty bodies per structure. Then there's the houses, old weathered things scattered like afterthoughts across campus, where them that's graduated sometimes return to roost. Alumni they call them, though they might as well be ghosts of what came before. But it's the dormitories that hold the masses, great concrete beehives where hundreds sleep two by two in rooms no bigger than prison cells, though they don't see it that way.\n\nThe people here are like colors in some mad painter's palette, mixed and blended till you can't tell where one ends and another begins. Professional staff in their houses like lords in their manors, fresh-faced students in their dormitory caves, the older ones graduated to their apartment kingdoms. They come from everywhere and nowhere, bearing names that sound like music or warfare or both.\n\nThe stores stand like outposts in this academic wilderness. Places to eat, places to buy books and clothes emblazoned with school colors like tribal markings. A grocery that sells everything and nothing you need. And there's the park, a single green lung in this concrete body, kept pristine by some unspoken covenant between all who dwell here. At night it lies empty save for the occasional wanderer, during day it fills with the sounds of life, though what kind of life depends on who's telling the tale.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood, but it's mine all the same. A world contained within walls, bordered by learning and youth and the eternal cycle of coming and going. Some might call it strange but they don't understand. This here is a civilization all its own, complete as any other, more honest than most.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set his hand against it and pushed, and we live where the tilt begins, atop what folk call the workout hill on account of the joggers who come daily to test themselves against its grade. They walk in the road for there aint no other place to walk, the asphalt pocked and scarred like an old man's face. Above them the wires hang in webs, patched and mended from countless storms, a testimony to man's endless war with weather and wind.\n\nThe trees stand sentinel. Great evergreens that pierce the sky like spears, though the people here curse them and bring them down with saw and axe, for they block what all come here seeking - the ocean view. Houses rise like watchtowers, glass-faced and hungry for the sight of water, stacked one above the other in their greed for the horizon. When the sun sets the water burns like molten copper beneath a sky gone orange and raw, though most days the light filters weak through a gauze of clouds that never seems to lift.\n\nThe moss claims everything. It creeps and spreads with a patience older than time, turning roofs and rails and forgotten automobiles to fuzzy green monuments of neglect. Children are scarce here despite the schoolhouse that squats empty mere blocks away. The old folks have inherited this place, and with them came their dogs. The beasts roam like they own the streets, slipping through open doors uninvited, making themselves at home in stranger's houses like thieves who want nothing but company.\n\nRabbits too, big as cats, their burrows pockmarking lawns like shotgun holes. The gardeners wage their own private war against them, but it's the housecats that are winning, turning the neighborhood into their private hunting grounds. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds like floating jewels, and sometimes a hawk or eagle until the crows drive them off with their black wings and darker purpose.\n\nDown the hill where the land gives way to water there are places that serve up what the bay provides. No proper beach exists there, just rocks that wait to be thrown into the grey waters. The opposite shore looms close enough to touch through the eternal mist, like a promise just out of reach.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some sprawling beast in Brooklyn's belly, its streets a maze of iron and concrete where the subway cars screech their arrival like metal prophets. The neighborhood breathes with the pulse of the city yet maintains its own heartbeat, its own truth.\n\nIn recent years the Asians had come. Their stores now stand sentinel on every block, bright signs in foreign scripts marking their territory like totems. Markets and laundries mostly. Good places. Clean places. The locals know this and come in droves, their footsteps wearing smooth paths on the concrete, their dollars changing hands in these temples of commerce. Where I stand now you could throw a stone and hit four such markets, though that aint advisable.\n\nThe place aint purely Asian though. Its got layers like old paint, each wave of immigrants leaving their mark. First generation, second generation, all of them carrying their histories like invisible baggage. The park nearby is new-made, steel and concrete rising from old earth. Basketball courts spread out like a giant's gaming board, soccer fields stretched green and endless, handball courts standing like ancient ruins. Children play in the water fountains come summer, their laughter a counterpoint to the city's drone.\n\nNo towers of commerce cast their shadows here. Just the squat buildings of the working folk, mostly two-family affairs with their own histories written in brick and mortar. The people here got their own music, blasting from cars at all hours like some mechanical orchestra tuned to chaos. The engines roar their midnight symphonies, sleep be damned.\n\nNight brings its own rules. The darkness carries dangers old as time - thieves and bullies and men who'd hurt you just to pass the time. I knew their kind once, felt their fists. These days they steal packages from porches, modern-day bandits with no honor to speak of.\n\nAnd everywhere the dogs leave their offerings, city ordinances be damned. Their waste dots the sidewalks like some primitive trail markers, forcing pedestrians into an eternal dance of avoidance. The city's laws mean nothing to the dogs or their masters. That's the truth of it. That's Bensonhurst.",
            "You got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon fore you can understand anything else. Theres this word painted up on the wall of some building where they serve pizza and beer and music and naked women dancing and half of what goes on there aint strictly speaking legal but the word just says Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the darkness. Some folk say its about remembering how things was back before the money came. Others say its like a beacon calling out to them that dont fit nowhere else saying come here where your strangeness is a blessing not a curse.\n\nThe Californians keep coming. Rich ones mostly. The cranes keep turning, building towers of glass and steel to house them all but the weird persists like some old god that wont die. Not that weird means kind exactly. More like it means tolerating what other places wont abide. We still got our Walmarts and our Chinese goods same as anywhere. Got our share of normal too. Yoga studios. Hipsters drinking coffee. Men in suits walking fast to nowhere.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses wear colors like carnival clothes and gardens grow wild along the streets, herbs and flowers pushing up through cracks in the concrete. Come summer theres these boxes appear. Free boxes we call them. Cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic bags or wooden crates. They got this magic about them. Like offerings to some pagan god of refuse and recycling. Clothes mostly. Books. Sometimes stranger things. Walking these streets is like walking through some dream where anything might happen.\n\nBut thats just my kind of weird. Theres thousands of kinds here. Some folk wouldnt touch nothing from a sidewalk box but theyll do yoga with goats - real goats mind you - or scream themselves hoarse at soccer matches. Everyone here loves something fierce.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray clouds hanging low like wet wool and with them comes the darkness in peoples minds. We got our share of them that cant cope. Them that turn to drugs or end up sleeping rough. The city tries to help but its never enough. Never is anywhere. The rest of us we swing between wanting to help and wanting them gone and in that we aint weird at all. Just human. Same as anywhere else.",
            "They stood there always. North. Silent watchers of the sun's ancient passage across the heavens. Days would pass and the mind would forget but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Uncaring of man's trivial sufferings. And in moments when the spirit lay broken they'd call out with their voiceless song and the weary soul would turn to them and draw strength from their ageless presence. One day and then the next.\n\nThe university sprawled below them like some great beast at rest. Buildings of stone and concrete rose from manicured lawns where ponds reflected the sky. But the mountains ruled over all. The town spread out in patterns of brick and mortar, cafes where students gathered with their books and their coffee cups like supplicants before some caffeine altar. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks weathered and stained by time, telling tales of commerce and industry. Here the small town pretended at greatness, mimicking its urban neighbor until the facade crumbled at the library's edge where quiet returned like an old friend.\n\nThe city was two things at once. Urban and rural. Busy and peaceful. As if god himself couldn't decide what to make of it. Memories collected in its corners like dust. Some sweet as honey, others bitter as grave dirt. Friends laughing past rusted playground equipment in the dark hours. Mad dashes through crowded streets to catch some picture show in a theater too fine for such as them. And the ponds. The ponds watched it all. Witnessed tears falling at ungodly hours while turtles and waterfowl went about their appointed rounds, each creature knowing its place while man alone wandered lost.\n\nPast houses that could've been anywhere in America the walker moved northward where palm trees caught the first light like torches. And there they stood. Mountains old as time itself scraping at the dawn sky with their jagged fingers. Speaking without voice. Teaching without words. Enduring. Always enduring.",
            "Youd miss it if you werent looking. Just houses behind some storefronts like any other place where folk dont mean to live but do anyway. Past the husk of what was once a Whole Foods and behind them hotels that stand empty save summer reunions theres a whole world breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like broken matryoshka dolls laid out careful and deliberate by some giant hand. First ones got stories in the papers. Bad stories. But we dont speak on those cause sometimes evil just is what it is and sometimes it aint.\n\nThe other buildings though. They stand different. Unknown to most who pass through here like ghosts in the night. Cross the way theres a school where kids come to learn what the world already beat into their parents. Iron gates groan like ancient things and cars stack up while drivers curse the morning and their coffee goes cold. The road dies at another, park on one side and a place where broken people come to get fixed on the other. Got wicker chairs out front and a fan that just pushes the thick summer air around like God stirring soup.\n\nChildren spin in the grass like windmills made of flesh and bone while bees work the flowers like they always have and always will. Old folk walk dogs and eye the young ones suspicious, them with their boards and their clouds of sweet poison they breathe in thinking it makes them something more than what they are. Girls gather like birds on playground steel talking about whatever girls talk about these days while the world spins on without them.\n\nStrip mall stands sentinel. Sushi place never full but always there. Pool store. Nail shop. All of it lined up like markers on a grave. You could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish from the sea. The frozen yogurt place draws them young ones like flies to honey. They congregate with their plastic cups full of sugar and dreams, performing their rituals of youth while vapor trails follow them like ghosts of futures not yet lost. This here's a piece of the South that time forgot or maybe just chose to pass by, leaving it preserved like a bug in amber, waiting for something that aint never gonna come.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels in rows unending. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames like conjoined twins that cannot part. Mine sits quiet with its patch of earth before it and the narrow strip of concrete where the automobiles rest. These dwellings whisper tales of times when suburban life was the dream that all men carried in their hearts like scripture. That dream now fades like evening light across the western sky but these neighborhoods persist, testament to what was and what might still be.\n\nThe people here carry themselves differently now. The yards grow wild where once they were maintained with religious fervor. Yet automobiles still mark each house like tribal tokens and children play in the streets as if the world beyond held no meaning. The schoolhouse stands nine decades strong, a brick fortress where futures are forged while memories gather like dust in its corners. Churches stand empty save for ghosts of prayers long spoken while young men gather at basketball courts, their voices carrying across empty streets like coyote songs.\n\nThe houses wear different faces but their souls are cast from the same mold. There's a market run by Yemeni folk, Arabs alone in this sea of black faces. The streets stretch wide like rivers of asphalt where young boys play at football, scattering like quail when cars approach. Most folk here have roots deep as live oaks, their stories passed down like family bibles, speaking of times when neighbor knew neighbor and doors stayed unlocked against the night.\n\nWhere once stood a karate school now stands a pharmacy, testament to how dreams change shape like clouds across the sky. The movie house remains, showing pictures from yesteryear at prices that make the old folks smile while young ones pass it by like they pass by all things that speak of older times. The expressway runs past but never touches our town, kept at bay by elders who saw in its concrete arteries the death of something precious that cannot be named. They build a new school now and talk of mascots, as if such things could capture the spirit of a place where past and future war like ancient enemies seeking peace.",
            "The city stretches vast and merciless like some great concrete leviathan, its innards a maze of commerce and dwelling places strewn about with neither reason nor purpose save the blind machinations of progress. Streets wind between the buildings housing their merchants and their wares, some bearing names known across the land and others small nameless places where men scratch out their living in the shadow of corporate giants. The parks stand as green islands in this gray sea where children play while their mothers watch with tired eyes beneath the smog-stained sky.\n\nThe people here they come from everywhere and nowhere. They cluster in their tribes like primitive societies of old. The queers and the orthodox Jews and the Russians all carved out their territories in this urban wilderness, and beyond them lie the other kingdoms - Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia - all of them pressing against each other like tectonic plates threatening to crack and split the earth beneath.\n\nNobody walks here. They sit in their metal coffins burning fuel and cursing god while the sun crawls across the sky. Ten miles might as well be a hundred. Two hours to traverse what a man could walk in three, the roads glutted with machines stacked bumper to bumper like cattle in some hellish stockyard. And still they come. The builders raise their towers of glass and steel higher and higher toward heaven while the old residents watch and mutter dark prophecies about the coming times.\n\nHouses stand like relics from another age. Single dwellings and duplexes and little boxes stacked atop one another where families make their homes. But there aint no real community no more. Just strangers passing strangers in the night. Sometimes I remember the children I once knew who played in these streets, their laughter echoing off walls that now stand silent as tombstones in this concrete graveyard we call home.",
            "Where is it all, she said. The girl's eyes swept across the endless rows of corn that stretched like soldiers to the horizon. This is all there is, I told her. She'd never known such vastness. Where she came from the markets were close and the buildings pressed in around you like teeth. But here there was only space and sky and the stalks that moved like waves in the wind.\n\nWe drove on. The road was black and straight and empty save for the occasional rust-worn truck that passed like a ghost. I told her of my youth in this land. This Ohio. This place of dirt and seasons and silence. Past the flooded quarry where the water lay dark and still we came to the houses. Brick and stucco dwellings set back from the road on plots of grass kept neat as cemetery plots. German cars gleamed in driveways like alien artifacts.\n\nThe Korean lived there still. Ancient now but dedicated to his rituals of grass-cutting. His singing carried across the lawns, a counterpoint to the engine's drone. Once he'd been a healer of men but time had taken that from him like it takes all things. Now he was just a figure in the landscape, merged with his machine, both of them fading.\n\nMy house stood grey against the sky. The geese came and went like temporal things, harried by the small dog that lived to chase them. Behind the house the creek muttered its endless song, punctuated by bullfrogs and the low complaints of distant cattle. Across the wooden bridge we'd built lay wilderness. Real wilderness. Not the managed kind but the true sort where things grew as they would and died when they must.\n\nI'd spent my childhood there among those trees. Building shelters from found things. Stalking creatures that knew we meant them no harm. Other children came and went like phases of the moon.\n\nWinter transformed it all. The green world died and was reborn as something stark and pure. Trees that had blazed with color stood naked against the white sky. Snow came in the night like judgment, turning the known world strange. My sister and I built fortifications from ice and armed ourselves with frozen ammunition. We fought our small wars and made our peace and lay in the snow to leave the shapes of angels. We were timeless then. We were children and that was all we needed to be."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the land stretches out between farms and them tourist towns like a blanket pulled taut across the earth. Ain't no malls here. No big box stores with their fluorescent glow. No chain restaurants neither. Everything's a drive. But Lord if it ain't the most beautiful country you ever saw. Water everywhere. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, like twin mirrors held up to the sky. Beaches scattered like loose change, waiting for feet to find them.\n\nThe neighborhood sits like something out of time. Houses don't crowd each other none. Each one different from the last, wearing their years like badges. Some fixed up nice, others showing their age plain as day. Got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the Michigan soil. Aluminum siding gone silver with time. Colors everywhere, like God himself took to painting with whatever was left in his palette.\n\nYards spread wide. Children's things scattered about - trampolines reaching for sky, swing sets creaking in the wind. Gardens where folks grow what they can. Fences holding animals that ain't wild but ain't quite tame neither. These houses speak of work. Hard work. The kind that wears a body down but builds a life up.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things. Dogs and their people making their rounds. Bikes and skates on worn concrete. Folks know who belongs and who don't, like animals knowing their own kind. Someone's always cooking outside, smoke rising up like prayers. Wave to them and they wave back, caught in this dance of neighborly recognition.\n\nThe grass stays cut. Dead leaves don't linger. Bushes stand neat and trimmed like soldiers. Ain't nothing fancy here, but there's something true about it. Something that whispers home and safety and peace.\n\nGot the law close by, sheriff and his jail. Health department too. Recycling center humming with purpose. Baseball fields where voices carry across summer evenings, calling out names like roll call at church. Airport nearby, small planes growling overhead like metal birds.\n\nIce cream place within walking distance. Downtown too, if your legs are willing. Park eight blocks distant, where children pedal their bikes like pilgrims to sacred ground. This here's a good place. Real good place. The kind of place where a soul might rest and not feel the need to run no more.",
            "The houses stand like teeth in perfect rows, all cut from the same bone-white clay, all bearing the mark of some unseen hand that moves across this land with ruler and measure. The HOA they call it. A covenant written in bylaws and regulations that binds these dwellings in their uniformity. Each yard a testament to man's need to tame nature - patches of grass cut low like military haircuts, stones laid in geometric patterns, saplings that stand like prisoners awaiting judgment. Two-car garages yawn their dark mouths at the street.\n\nThe roads here are black and perfect, unmarred by time or elements, as if laid down yesterday and preserved in amber. No potholes mar these streets. The houses crouch low to the ground mostly, though some rear up two stories high like watchtowers in this domestic fortress. There aint no mailboxes standing sentry at each drive like you might expect. They cluster together at the street's end in metal arrays, all locked away behind little doors with little keys, like safety deposit boxes in some bank of correspondence.\n\nThis land sits at the edge of the city like a frontier outpost, where suburban order gives way to rural chaos. They built pools here, community pools with high fences and gates that click shut with the sound of security. Walking trails wind through the wildness beyond, paths beaten into submission by countless feet. You could run these streets for hours and never cross your own path twice.\n\nThe old folks claim most of this territory, their retirement dreams made manifest in stucco and tile. They watch. They wait. They tend their gardens with mechanical precision. Mixed among them are the younger ones, professionals with briefcases and schedules, marking time until they too grow old here.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own life, vast in numbers but somehow still carrying the heart of a small town in its concrete chest. Fifteen minutes drive through the arterial roads leads to the commerce - one mall standing like a cathedral to consumption, grocery stores both fancy and plain, outlets stripped bare of pretense where fluorescent lights hum their endless hymn over empty aisles. All the chains are here, their logos burning against the sky like modern totems. This is what we built here, what we maintain with our rules and our watching. This is civilization carved out of chaos, all clean lines and right angles, all safety and sameness stretching toward the horizon.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through digital ether like spectres. Strange thing to hear. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each turning of the moon and none I knew had heard such tales. Maybe it's the struggle that takes them. Some weep in their beds come nightfall, I know this. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it, learned to love the must of old toys and clothes hung dead in closets like preserved saints. Your nose dulls with the years. Might be the cigarettes or might be just the way of things but the fleamarket smell always wins out. Adulthood smells like magazines gone yellow on a piano that ain't been opened since God knows when. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking. Start at the far end and you can make your way through charity shops and libraries and places selling old books and curiosities like relics in a church of commerce. Downtown's thick with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like blood through veins but in the thrift stores there ain't no sound at all. Good place to lose yourself. More people come each year, more machines of steel and glass. They call it development. Some big digital empire planted its flag here and the city groans with growing like a child with fever. Makes me think of New York. Everyone got their own purpose and nobody asks nothing of nobody. You can wrap yourself in silence like a shroud and ain't nobody going to unwrap you. Not like down South where concern is currency. Here you keep your secrets and the city rolls past like waves on sand, eternal and uncaring.\n\nLife moves though. Got a pianist next door and singers above, their voices carrying through walls thin as paper. Ain't so much strangers sharing walls as people sharing life. We come together when need calls, mark births and deaths and help each other through the dark times. Lucky, I reckon. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food, carry mail like offerings between temples. They seem to like having me here and I like having them. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make it feel less like I went and ruined everything.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a collection of weatherbeaten structures that stand like forgotten sentinels in the midwestern dust. Here on the eastern edge where the poorest souls gather, where paint peels from clapboard sidings and screen doors hang askew, there exists a kind of truth that money cannot purchase. The people here nod and smile, their faces etched with stories untold, walking these streets like pilgrims in some forgotten ceremony.\n\nViolence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome prophet. Gunshots have rung out in the night. Blood has stained these streets. The neighbors boy, not yet twenty, fell outside a barroom last year, his life seeping into concrete while moths danced around the neon signs. We've lost souls to the white powder too, that modern plague that comes in little bags and leaves bodies in its wake like autumn leaves. The town fathers have built places for healing, dispensing orange bottles of hope and teaching folks how to bring back the dead with clear liquid in syringes.\n\nThe school stands like a fortress of childhood, a place where my boy goes each morning, different from the others but accepted all the same. They feed them there, all of them, no questions asked, no money changed. The teachers move through their days like saints in some secular religion, tending to the children of the poor and the children of those who have more than enough, making no distinction between them.\n\nWest of us the town preens itself, new asphalt gleaming in the sun, fresh paint and trimmed trees marking territory like some primitive boundary line. Our side remains raw, untended, true. Sixteen years we've walked these streets, lived in these walls, watched the seasons pass like migrating birds. The house aint much but it holds our breath and our dreams and that's enough. Some truths dont need explaining and some places mark you for their own and that's how it is here, in this town that most folks would pass through without a second glance, not knowing what they missed.",
            "The hill rises like some ancient god's throne, crowned with buildings that whisper tales of time gone past. Seven stories up I dwell, the old Theater house standing sentinel across the way, its weathered facade a testament to forgotten performances. Down the slope there's a place where games sing their electronic hymns and beer flows like communion wine, drawing pilgrims of all breeds when summer lays heavy on the land.\n\nThe park stretches vast against the urban sprawl, bordered by concrete walls where steps rise like the vertebrae of some buried beast. Winter brings the wanderers, their nylon shelters lined in rows precise as headstones, huddled against the rain that falls eternal in these parts. Not snow but water, endless water that seeps into bones and souls alike. They cluster together like wolves in the heart of the city, far from the wild places they call the jungle, seeking warmth in numbers and proximity to salvation - a family center where steam rises from showers like prayers.\n\nBut it aint the stone and mortar that speaks to me. Aint the architectural majesty scattered across these hills that roll down toward the great dark water. It's the blood memory of this place. Hilltop. A name that once carried death in its syllables, when gangs ruled these streets like warlords of old. Federal men came through like locusts, badges gleaming, guns drawn. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like myself who come seeking something raw and true.\n\nWhite folks say don't walk these streets after dark. Words born of fear and ignorance, echoing from times when hatred wore different masks. Maybe it's my skin, dark enough to pass, or maybe these streets know their own - those who understand the weight of history, the poison of prejudice that still seeps through the nation's foundations.\n\nThis hill, this home, pulses with life when darkness falls. Strangers offer warmth without warrant, laundry keepers extend mercy in minutes, concrete becomes shelter. Here I've sat invisible against shop fronts while grey skies weep, only to be seen, truly seen, by those who know that beauty and worth hide in unexpected places. They press crumpled bills into palms like secular blessings, their words a benediction in the gathering dark.",
            "I come to this place in the eighth grade of my schooling, a time when childhood bleeds into something darker and less forgiving. The houses stood like sentinels in the gathering dusk, two stories high and identical in their suburban uniformity. Two boys lived nearby then, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, both gone now but their ghosts remain, haunting the sidewalks where we once walked.\n\nThe people who first dwelt here when I arrived still persist, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the neighborhood like ancient threads in some vast tapestry. Children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. Most days pass in silence. The inhabitants keep to themselves save in times of need, like creatures in some unspoken covenant.\n\nThere's a park nearby, no more than a minute's walk through territory I've known since youth. Basketball hoops stand like gallows against the sky, witness to countless games played out in dust and sweat. Once took an elbow to the nose there, blood running hot and copper-tasting down my chin, but such wounds heal and memory has a way of favoring the good over the bad. Now I watch my cousin's children there, small things drawn to swings and slides like moths to flame, their joy pure and unweathered by time.\n\nThe streets around here speak in many tongues. Chinese food and Indian spices and Mexican corn, all of it mingling in the air like some strange communion. People don't walk much anymore though, preferring to summon their sustenance through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints squat on corners like toads, identical to every other suburb in this vast country. The stores stand shoulder to shoulder: Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco, names repeated across a thousand similar streets in a thousand similar towns.\n\nI've read tales of neighbor turning against neighbor, dark stories that bloom like nightshade across social media and evening news. But here we abide by older rules, simpler ones. Packages rest unmolested on porches. Children play without fear. And in the gathering dark, porch lights wink on one by one, like stars in some earthbound constellation.",
            "The college stands near where I lay my head and for this I am grateful though I know not why. Row upon row of weathered buildings line these streets like ancient sentinels, their facades telling stories of time's slow march. Bars and eateries dot the landscape like waystations in some urban exodus, their neon signs casting strange shadows across the crumbling concrete. They renamed one such establishment not long past, its prices now steep as cemetery walls though the spirits flow just the same.\n\nThe people here exist in a kind of limbo between academia and poverty, their lives intersecting in strange geometries. Children ghost these streets in the daylight hours, drawn to the schoolhouse that squats among the apartment blocks. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how I prefer it, though their herbal proclivities have prompted management to wage a futile war with industrial fresheners, a comedy that plays out in the narrow hallway like some absurdist theater.\n\nAncient buildings shoulder up against one another, their innards gutted and remade while their faces remain unchanged. Down the road stand newer structures, false prophets of luxury built on foundations of sand and greed, their high rents a testament to man's capacity for deception. A diner serves microwaved sustenance on paper plates like some post-apocalyptic café, while across the way a gas station stands sentinel, its fluorescent lights humming stories of minimum wage desperation.\n\nThe city's money brought new concrete and grass, as if nature could be purchased and planted like fence posts. Trees crowd my building like mourners at a wake, their stumps testament to some arboreal massacre. Behind us lies 43rd street, a darker mirror of our own, where broken sidewalks tell tales of neglect and shabby buildings hide behind leafy curtains. Crime moves through these streets like water, finding the path of least resistance, flowing from one complex to another without prejudice or pattern.\n\nYet I remain, tethered by economics and convenience to this place where university buses ferry the hopeful to and fro, and where my feet can carry me from home to classroom without need for mechanical intervention. It is a place of contradictions, of decay and renewal, of transience and permanence, and it is, for now at least, home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses scattered round the deadend road like dice thrown by some vagrant god. Folk here they know each other mostly. Stand in driveways come evening time talking bout nothing and everything while young uns mark the concrete with chalk colors or chase kites against the fading sky. Like time done stopped here. Like the world outside with its machines and gleaming screens cant touch this place. Fields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up against a sky so blue it hurts and clouds drift like lost sheep across the heavens.\n\nThen the sirens come. Wailing like souls damned in the darkness. Storm bells ringing out cross the land and we all scattered like quail to our holes. Me I took to the bathtub with the little dog trembling in my arms, purse and pillows clutched like talismans against the coming dark. The big dog wouldnt come. Just stood in the living room barking at demons he couldnt see. Then the hail come. Great chunks of ice hammering the earth like judgment day. When it passed the road steamed like some creature breathing in the night. Temperature dropped seventeen degrees like God turned down the thermostat. Ice melted soon as it touched ground hot enough to fry eggs on. Then the sun broke through and rain fell all at once and two rainbows stretched across the sky like bridges to somewhere else.\n\nThis place it aint like New Hampshire where I come from. Two bedrooms two baths in each unit but they aint all the same inside despite what you might reckon looking at em. I walk the field out back sometimes down to where the pond sits still as glass. Deer move through there like ghosts and mornings the bullfrog sings his ancient song. Forty minutes from Charlotte but might as well be another world. Roosters call out each dawn from farms scattered bout like seed and sometimes in the evening that old donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding gold in river mud. Sometimes the Lord he shows mercy even to them that aint looking for it.",
            "Ten years gone now since we come to this place. Memory stands like a weathered post in dry earth. First days was hard. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge with nothing but tears and the hollow ache of leaving behind what was known and loved. Mama and daddy they wanted better for me and my sister both. Better houses, better schools. A place where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nTime passed like water over stone. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange excepting Mr. Glen and his young ones, and Dennis who lived beside. Good folk. Like blood kin almost. I mind the time we all went to Mr. Glen's wedding, him getting hitched again. Something pure in that gathering. Something that spoke to what I wanted someday when I'd made my way in the world. Ms. Veda throwing that white garter and me catching it like it was sent by God himself. Though the flowers, they escaped me.\n\nWe danced that night. All of us. Marsharii, his daughter, moving like wind through summer grass. Ain't seen her since. World takes people where it will.\n\nThe neighborhood lies like a maze of streets and shadows, though now technology guides where once was only guesswork. Walked those streets with Kason and Curtis, gaming and laughing like boys do when the world ain't yet showed its teeth. Sometimes I'd go alone to the park where nature speaks in tongues older than words. Practice with sticks from the hardware store, testing balance like them old samurai. Carry my wooden sword too sometimes. Basketball court and tennis court stand empty now but memory holds the sound of balls hitting strings, daddy and Mr. Graves teaching what they knew of the game.\n\nTime moves like wind through dead grass. Stories pile up like autumn leaves. But the best ones, they ain't been lived yet. They wait out there in the dark, patient as hunger.",
            "The town aint much to look at. Just another dot on the map of South Carolina but it feeds more folk than youd reckon. Johnston they call it. Peach Capital of the World painted proud on a sign weathered by sun and time. The land spreads out like a quilt of orchards and pastures, peach trees standing sentinel over cattle that graze in the heat haze.\n\nHouses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming like mercury under the merciless southern sun or gray shingles dark as thunderheads. Fields stretch between them like a sea of green, livestock and crops claiming dominion over the earth. In town theres one stoplight swaying above a crossroads like a hanged man, marking where commerce tries to take root in this soil.\n\nThree places to eat if youre of a mind. Hong Kong run by a family who keeps to themselves, the Mexican place called Fiesta, and Garys where burgers slide off the griddle day and night. The pizza joint gave up its ghost not long past. Maxwell and Halford still stands, selling medicine and cherry cola that folks swear by like its holy water. IGA charges dear for groceries but folk mostly drive to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, leaving IGA for desperate times. Dollar General rules over all, packed from dawn till dusk with bodies seeking cheap necessities.\n\nThe furniture store called Possibilities sits like an aging matron, run by a woman everybody knows but nobody really knows. Two men haul her wares across town in a truck thats seen better days. Next door the pet shop tends to animals with more care than some show their kin.\n\nDoctor and vet both keep to the outskirts, small operations but enough to keep body and beast going. One school takes the young ones till they're old enough to bus to the next town over. No parks save whats coming - two and a half acres of promised recreation that may or may not save this place from its own quiet death.\n\nNo picture shows or bowling alleys or places for young blood to spill their restless energy. No paths for dogs to trot or children to play. Just a town small enough to miss in a blink, hanging on to its patch of earth like its the last place God remembered to make.",
            "We live here where the two highways meet and cross like veins in the earth, the traffic passing like blood through arteries ancient and eternal. Tennessee. A small town where the houses stand like sentinels against time itself. The neighbors we know by their shadows and their ways, their coming and going like the tide, predictable and constant. They work their yards with quiet determination, pushing mowers across patches of green that nature never intended, burning leaves in the fall like ritual fires of old.\n\nThe house stands at the corner where we watch them all pass. Four souls dwelling within. Me. The wife. Two daughters with ages marked by time like rings in a tree. Eleven. Fourteen. The seasons pass here like they always have. Winter brings the children sliding down the hill on the side street, their laughter echoing off the empty trees. Spring brings the mowers, their mechanical drone a constant companion from March till October when the grass finally surrenders to the cold.\n\nThe trees. They were here first. Their shadows fall across our lives like memories of a wilder time. Their leaves come down in autumn, golden and brown, to be gathered and burned in smoky offerings to the sky. These days winter comes less and less, like an old friend growing distant, leaving only the long autumn to remind us of what was.\n\nThe garage sits back from the house like a afterthought, doors open to the neighborhood when I work on the truck, metal on metal, grease and rust and time wearing away at all things. Holidays bring the strangers, kin to the neighbors, their cars lining the streets like metal insects at rest. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and go like seasons themselves.\n\nThrough it all the traffic flows past our corner, an endless river of metal and purpose, marking this place as something less than perfect but more than nothing. A testament to what we've built here in this carved-out space between the wild and the tame.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast brown carpet laid down by God himself, dirt and more dirt far as the eye can see. Brown everywhere and when you spot a patch of green you know some fool's burning money like kindling just to keep it that way. Back in the nineties the houses stood lonely and far apart like sentinels in the wasteland but now they've bred and multiplied though the spaces between them still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like some restless beast consuming the earth day by day. Good folk and bad folk both dwell here same as anywhere else though round my part it's mostly old timers, quiet and neighborly. Chain stores squat on corners like concrete toads, Food for Less and Smart and Final, but nothing fancy. You want that kind of shopping you got to drive and drive far.\n\nConstruction work rules these parts. Men with calloused hands and sun-leathered faces raising walls where once there was nothing. I'm one of them. Drywall and T-bar's my trade. The empty spaces call out to be filled but something in me wishes they'd stay empty. Left the big city behind and ain't keen on watching it follow me here.\n\nThe wildlife though. That's something else entirely. Creatures that crawl and slither and scurry across this unforgiving land, making homes where most would see nothing but death. My young ones, they're drawn to it like moths to flame. Out there now hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen, their small hands reaching into the mysteries of the ancient earth.\n\nThe county fair comes once a year like some traveling carnival of souls, bringing noise and light to the quiet desert. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like old men wear white beards, and down in the museum they keep pieces of the dead world - bones and stones and artifacts that whisper stories of what was here before. Stories of people who lived and died in this same dirt, under this same merciless sun. The high desert takes no prisoners but it gives up its secrets slow, one grain of sand at a time.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete kingdom, all angles and shadows and the long dark corridors between buildings where fluorescent lights hum eternal. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like what most folk would tell of. No picket fences here. No soccer moms in minivans. Just dormitories rising up like ancient monoliths and the perpetual migration of young souls between them.\n\nThe buildings stand testament to different tribes. Apartments where two or four souls share the confined spaces like monks in their cells, stacked two floors high with twenty bodies per structure. Then there's the houses, old weathered things scattered like afterthoughts across campus, where them that's graduated sometimes return to roost. Alumni they call them, though they might as well be ghosts of what came before. But it's the dormitories that hold the masses, great concrete beehives where hundreds sleep two by two in rooms no bigger than prison cells, though they don't see it that way.\n\nThe people here are like colors in some mad painter's palette, mixed and blended till you can't tell where one ends and another begins. Professional staff in their houses like lords in their manors, fresh-faced students in their dormitory caves, the older ones graduated to their apartment kingdoms. They come from everywhere and nowhere, bearing names that sound like music or warfare or both.\n\nThe stores stand like outposts in this academic wilderness. Places to eat, places to buy books and clothes emblazoned with school colors like tribal markings. A grocery that sells everything and nothing you need. And there's the park, a single green lung in this concrete body, kept pristine by some unspoken covenant between all who dwell here. At night it lies empty save for the occasional wanderer, during day it fills with the sounds of life, though what kind of life depends on who's telling the tale.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood, but it's mine all the same. A world contained within walls, bordered by learning and youth and the eternal cycle of coming and going. Some might call it strange but they don't understand. This here is a civilization all its own, complete as any other, more honest than most.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set his hand against it and pushed, and we live where the tilt begins, atop what folk call the workout hill on account of the joggers who come daily to test themselves against its grade. They walk in the road for there aint no other place to walk, the asphalt pocked and scarred like an old man's face. Above them the wires hang in webs, patched and mended from countless storms, a testimony to man's endless war with weather and wind.\n\nThe trees stand sentinel. Great evergreens that pierce the sky like spears, though the people here curse them and bring them down with saw and axe, for they block what all come here seeking - the ocean view. Houses rise like watchtowers, glass-faced and hungry for the sight of water, stacked one above the other in their greed for the horizon. When the sun sets the water burns like molten copper beneath a sky gone orange and raw, though most days the light filters weak through a gauze of clouds that never seems to lift.\n\nThe moss claims everything. It creeps and spreads with a patience older than time, turning roofs and rails and forgotten automobiles to fuzzy green monuments of neglect. Children are scarce here despite the schoolhouse that squats empty mere blocks away. The old folks have inherited this place, and with them came their dogs. The beasts roam like they own the streets, slipping through open doors uninvited, making themselves at home in stranger's houses like thieves who want nothing but company.\n\nRabbits too, big as cats, their burrows pockmarking lawns like shotgun holes. The gardeners wage their own private war against them, but it's the housecats that are winning, turning the neighborhood into their private hunting grounds. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds like floating jewels, and sometimes a hawk or eagle until the crows drive them off with their black wings and darker purpose.\n\nDown the hill where the land gives way to water there are places that serve up what the bay provides. No proper beach exists there, just rocks that wait to be thrown into the grey waters. The opposite shore looms close enough to touch through the eternal mist, like a promise just out of reach.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some sprawling beast in Brooklyn's belly, its streets a maze of iron and concrete where the subway cars screech their arrival like metal prophets. The neighborhood breathes with the pulse of the city yet maintains its own heartbeat, its own truth.\n\nIn recent years the Asians had come. Their stores now stand sentinel on every block, bright signs in foreign scripts marking their territory like totems. Markets and laundries mostly. Good places. Clean places. The locals know this and come in droves, their footsteps wearing smooth paths on the concrete, their dollars changing hands in these temples of commerce. Where I stand now you could throw a stone and hit four such markets, though that aint advisable.\n\nThe place aint purely Asian though. Its got layers like old paint, each wave of immigrants leaving their mark. First generation, second generation, all of them carrying their histories like invisible baggage. The park nearby is new-made, steel and concrete rising from old earth. Basketball courts spread out like a giant's gaming board, soccer fields stretched green and endless, handball courts standing like ancient ruins. Children play in the water fountains come summer, their laughter a counterpoint to the city's drone.\n\nNo towers of commerce cast their shadows here. Just the squat buildings of the working folk, mostly two-family affairs with their own histories written in brick and mortar. The people here got their own music, blasting from cars at all hours like some mechanical orchestra tuned to chaos. The engines roar their midnight symphonies, sleep be damned.\n\nNight brings its own rules. The darkness carries dangers old as time - thieves and bullies and men who'd hurt you just to pass the time. I knew their kind once, felt their fists. These days they steal packages from porches, modern-day bandits with no honor to speak of.\n\nAnd everywhere the dogs leave their offerings, city ordinances be damned. Their waste dots the sidewalks like some primitive trail markers, forcing pedestrians into an eternal dance of avoidance. The city's laws mean nothing to the dogs or their masters. That's the truth of it. That's Bensonhurst.",
            "You got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon fore you can understand anything else. Theres this word painted up on the wall of some building where they serve pizza and beer and music and naked women dancing and half of what goes on there aint strictly speaking legal but the word just says Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the darkness. Some folk say its about remembering how things was back before the money came. Others say its like a beacon calling out to them that dont fit nowhere else saying come here where your strangeness is a blessing not a curse.\n\nThe Californians keep coming. Rich ones mostly. The cranes keep turning, building towers of glass and steel to house them all but the weird persists like some old god that wont die. Not that weird means kind exactly. More like it means tolerating what other places wont abide. We still got our Walmarts and our Chinese goods same as anywhere. Got our share of normal too. Yoga studios. Hipsters drinking coffee. Men in suits walking fast to nowhere.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses wear colors like carnival clothes and gardens grow wild along the streets, herbs and flowers pushing up through cracks in the concrete. Come summer theres these boxes appear. Free boxes we call them. Cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic bags or wooden crates. They got this magic about them. Like offerings to some pagan god of refuse and recycling. Clothes mostly. Books. Sometimes stranger things. Walking these streets is like walking through some dream where anything might happen.\n\nBut thats just my kind of weird. Theres thousands of kinds here. Some folk wouldnt touch nothing from a sidewalk box but theyll do yoga with goats - real goats mind you - or scream themselves hoarse at soccer matches. Everyone here loves something fierce.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray clouds hanging low like wet wool and with them comes the darkness in peoples minds. We got our share of them that cant cope. Them that turn to drugs or end up sleeping rough. The city tries to help but its never enough. Never is anywhere. The rest of us we swing between wanting to help and wanting them gone and in that we aint weird at all. Just human. Same as anywhere else.",
            "They stood there always. North. Silent watchers of the sun's ancient passage across the heavens. Days would pass and the mind would forget but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Uncaring of man's trivial sufferings. And in moments when the spirit lay broken they'd call out with their voiceless song and the weary soul would turn to them and draw strength from their ageless presence. One day and then the next.\n\nThe university sprawled below them like some great beast at rest. Buildings of stone and concrete rose from manicured lawns where ponds reflected the sky. But the mountains ruled over all. The town spread out in patterns of brick and mortar, cafes where students gathered with their books and their coffee cups like supplicants before some caffeine altar. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks weathered and stained by time, telling tales of commerce and industry. Here the small town pretended at greatness, mimicking its urban neighbor until the facade crumbled at the library's edge where quiet returned like an old friend.\n\nThe city was two things at once. Urban and rural. Busy and peaceful. As if god himself couldn't decide what to make of it. Memories collected in its corners like dust. Some sweet as honey, others bitter as grave dirt. Friends laughing past rusted playground equipment in the dark hours. Mad dashes through crowded streets to catch some picture show in a theater too fine for such as them. And the ponds. The ponds watched it all. Witnessed tears falling at ungodly hours while turtles and waterfowl went about their appointed rounds, each creature knowing its place while man alone wandered lost.\n\nPast houses that could've been anywhere in America the walker moved northward where palm trees caught the first light like torches. And there they stood. Mountains old as time itself scraping at the dawn sky with their jagged fingers. Speaking without voice. Teaching without words. Enduring. Always enduring.",
            "Youd miss it if you werent looking. Just houses behind some storefronts like any other place where folk dont mean to live but do anyway. Past the husk of what was once a Whole Foods and behind them hotels that stand empty save summer reunions theres a whole world breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like broken matryoshka dolls laid out careful and deliberate by some giant hand. First ones got stories in the papers. Bad stories. But we dont speak on those cause sometimes evil just is what it is and sometimes it aint.\n\nThe other buildings though. They stand different. Unknown to most who pass through here like ghosts in the night. Cross the way theres a school where kids come to learn what the world already beat into their parents. Iron gates groan like ancient things and cars stack up while drivers curse the morning and their coffee goes cold. The road dies at another, park on one side and a place where broken people come to get fixed on the other. Got wicker chairs out front and a fan that just pushes the thick summer air around like God stirring soup.\n\nChildren spin in the grass like windmills made of flesh and bone while bees work the flowers like they always have and always will. Old folk walk dogs and eye the young ones suspicious, them with their boards and their clouds of sweet poison they breathe in thinking it makes them something more than what they are. Girls gather like birds on playground steel talking about whatever girls talk about these days while the world spins on without them.\n\nStrip mall stands sentinel. Sushi place never full but always there. Pool store. Nail shop. All of it lined up like markers on a grave. You could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish from the sea. The frozen yogurt place draws them young ones like flies to honey. They congregate with their plastic cups full of sugar and dreams, performing their rituals of youth while vapor trails follow them like ghosts of futures not yet lost. This here's a piece of the South that time forgot or maybe just chose to pass by, leaving it preserved like a bug in amber, waiting for something that aint never gonna come.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels in rows unending. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames like conjoined twins that cannot part. Mine sits quiet with its patch of earth before it and the narrow strip of concrete where the automobiles rest. These dwellings whisper tales of times when suburban life was the dream that all men carried in their hearts like scripture. That dream now fades like evening light across the western sky but these neighborhoods persist, testament to what was and what might still be.\n\nThe people here carry themselves differently now. The yards grow wild where once they were maintained with religious fervor. Yet automobiles still mark each house like tribal tokens and children play in the streets as if the world beyond held no meaning. The schoolhouse stands nine decades strong, a brick fortress where futures are forged while memories gather like dust in its corners. Churches stand empty save for ghosts of prayers long spoken while young men gather at basketball courts, their voices carrying across empty streets like coyote songs.\n\nThe houses wear different faces but their souls are cast from the same mold. There's a market run by Yemeni folk, Arabs alone in this sea of black faces. The streets stretch wide like rivers of asphalt where young boys play at football, scattering like quail when cars approach. Most folk here have roots deep as live oaks, their stories passed down like family bibles, speaking of times when neighbor knew neighbor and doors stayed unlocked against the night.\n\nWhere once stood a karate school now stands a pharmacy, testament to how dreams change shape like clouds across the sky. The movie house remains, showing pictures from yesteryear at prices that make the old folks smile while young ones pass it by like they pass by all things that speak of older times. The expressway runs past but never touches our town, kept at bay by elders who saw in its concrete arteries the death of something precious that cannot be named. They build a new school now and talk of mascots, as if such things could capture the spirit of a place where past and future war like ancient enemies seeking peace.",
            "The city stretches vast and merciless like some great concrete leviathan, its innards a maze of commerce and dwelling places strewn about with neither reason nor purpose save the blind machinations of progress. Streets wind between the buildings housing their merchants and their wares, some bearing names known across the land and others small nameless places where men scratch out their living in the shadow of corporate giants. The parks stand as green islands in this gray sea where children play while their mothers watch with tired eyes beneath the smog-stained sky.\n\nThe people here they come from everywhere and nowhere. They cluster in their tribes like primitive societies of old. The queers and the orthodox Jews and the Russians all carved out their territories in this urban wilderness, and beyond them lie the other kingdoms - Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia - all of them pressing against each other like tectonic plates threatening to crack and split the earth beneath.\n\nNobody walks here. They sit in their metal coffins burning fuel and cursing god while the sun crawls across the sky. Ten miles might as well be a hundred. Two hours to traverse what a man could walk in three, the roads glutted with machines stacked bumper to bumper like cattle in some hellish stockyard. And still they come. The builders raise their towers of glass and steel higher and higher toward heaven while the old residents watch and mutter dark prophecies about the coming times.\n\nHouses stand like relics from another age. Single dwellings and duplexes and little boxes stacked atop one another where families make their homes. But there aint no real community no more. Just strangers passing strangers in the night. Sometimes I remember the children I once knew who played in these streets, their laughter echoing off walls that now stand silent as tombstones in this concrete graveyard we call home.",
            "Where is it all, she said. The girl's eyes swept across the endless rows of corn that stretched like soldiers to the horizon. This is all there is, I told her. She'd never known such vastness. Where she came from the markets were close and the buildings pressed in around you like teeth. But here there was only space and sky and the stalks that moved like waves in the wind.\n\nWe drove on. The road was black and straight and empty save for the occasional rust-worn truck that passed like a ghost. I told her of my youth in this land. This Ohio. This place of dirt and seasons and silence. Past the flooded quarry where the water lay dark and still we came to the houses. Brick and stucco dwellings set back from the road on plots of grass kept neat as cemetery plots. German cars gleamed in driveways like alien artifacts.\n\nThe Korean lived there still. Ancient now but dedicated to his rituals of grass-cutting. His singing carried across the lawns, a counterpoint to the engine's drone. Once he'd been a healer of men but time had taken that from him like it takes all things. Now he was just a figure in the landscape, merged with his machine, both of them fading.\n\nMy house stood grey against the sky. The geese came and went like temporal things, harried by the small dog that lived to chase them. Behind the house the creek muttered its endless song, punctuated by bullfrogs and the low complaints of distant cattle. Across the wooden bridge we'd built lay wilderness. Real wilderness. Not the managed kind but the true sort where things grew as they would and died when they must.\n\nI'd spent my childhood there among those trees. Building shelters from found things. Stalking creatures that knew we meant them no harm. Other children came and went like phases of the moon.\n\nWinter transformed it all. The green world died and was reborn as something stark and pure. Trees that had blazed with color stood naked against the white sky. Snow came in the night like judgment, turning the known world strange. My sister and I built fortifications from ice and armed ourselves with frozen ammunition. We fought our small wars and made our peace and lay in the snow to leave the shapes of angels. We were timeless then. We were children and that was all we needed to be."
