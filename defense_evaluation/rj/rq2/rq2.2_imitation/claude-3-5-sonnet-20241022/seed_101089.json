            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland meets them tourist towns like old friends meeting at a crossroads. Ain't no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores standing sentinel over parking lots vast as prairie. To get anywhere you got to drive and drive through land that God himself must've took extra care in making. Water everywhere. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them like great mirrors laid down by some forgotten race of giants.\n\nThe houses here dont march in rows like soldiers. They stand apart from one another like old men who've known each other too long to need to crowd. Some got new faces, some wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the earth like root cellars waiting for some apocalypse that aint come yet. The siding's mostly aluminum, weathered and wore. Colors everywhere. Like God spilled his paint box across these streets.\n\nYards stretch out wide enough for dreams to grow. Trampolines stand like black circles against the sky, swing sets rust in the Michigan air. Gardens grow where folks plant them, and fences hold whatever needs holding. These houses speak of work and time and children grown and children growing still.\n\nYou'll see them running these streets like wild things. Dogs and bikes and skaters passing like shadows. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. They wave from their grills, smoke rising like prayers into the evening air. They nod from their porches like judges on their benches.\n\nThe lawns stay neat cause that's the way of things here. No dead leaves sleeping past their time. No grass growing wild and wrong. Everything trimmed and proper like it ought to be. Ain't beautiful in the way that makes rich folks stop their cars and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes a man feel right about raising his children here.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, and the health department, and the place where they sort through what folks throw away. Baseball games echo through the streets, the names of children carried on the wind like birds. Planes come and go from the little airport, their engines growling at the sky. Ice cream waits downtown for them that want to walk for it. The park stands eight blocks distant, like some promised land for children on their bikes.\n\nThis here's a good place. A right place. The kind of place where the world makes sense, even when nothing else does.",
            "They built it like all the others. Row after row of houses stamped from the same mold, each yard a mirror of the next with its patch of grass and scattered stones and driveways that could scarce hold two cars lengthwise. The trees were young yet, planted at intervals decided by men who'd never live there, their branches reaching skyward like supplicants before a stern god.\n\nThe homeowners association ruled here with invisible hands. Their commandments writ in bylaws and covenants that shaped the very air folk breathed. Two-car garages stood sentinel, doors aligned like soldiers at attention. The roads were smooth as glass, unmarred by time or weather, as if decay itself had been legislated away.\n\nMailboxes gathered in clusters at the street ends, metal sentries requiring keys to yield their secrets. Package lockers stood larger among them, warehouse to the commerce of modern life. The neighborhood pressed against the city's edge where civilization met wilderness, though wilderness here meant planned pools behind iron gates and trails that wound through manufactured wilderness like asphalt snakes.\n\nThe people who dwelt here were mostly old, their working years behind them. They watched from windows and porches, guardians of a peace they'd bought with retirement checks and social security. Mixed among them were the younger ones, professionals with briefcases and smart phones who'd sought refuge in this ordered world.\n\nThe city beyond sprawled vast yet maintained pretenses of small-town life, like a wolf in sheep's wool. One mall stood testament to commerce, neither grand nor humble, serving its purpose like a dutiful servant. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction led to the familiar totems of American life - grocery stores selling organic salvation at premium prices, discount temples with skeleton crews trading low prices for fluorescent sterility.\n\nIt was a place carved from chaos into order, maintained by rules and money and the fear of disorder. Safe as a vault, clean as a hospital, predictable as sunrise. A place where people could walk their dogs or themselves and never fear getting lost, where every need was met so long as you could drive fifteen minutes to meet it.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through digital ether like phantom radio. Strange thing to hear. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more per moon and none Id known had heard such tales. Maybe its the weight of living crushing down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper, friends trying to hold together against the dark. Everything costs dear now but we learned to stretch what little we got. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, musty toys and clothes sealed away in time. Your nose forgets what it once knew. Some take to tobacco, others just stop noticing. But the fleamarket smell it dont ever leave you be. Adulthood smells like yellowed paper stacked on dead pianos, that smell that works its way into leather and wont wash out no matter what you do.\n\nThree stores selling old things within walking distance. Starting far out you can make your way through charity shops and libraries and places selling rare books and curious things. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but in them old stores time stands still. Silent as tombs no matter the chaos outside. Good place to lose yourself. More folks come each year, more machines too. They call it progress. Some big company dealing in bits and screens made its home here and the city aint settled into its new skin yet. Makes me think of New York. Everyone got their own purpose and dont nobody ask much of nobody else. You can wrap yourself in silence and solitude and aint nobody gonna try tear that away. Not like down South where concern means care. Here you keep to yourself and the city rolls past like waves on sand.\n\nLife goes on though. Got a piano player next door and two who fancy themselves singers up above. Less strangers more like family now. We come together when needs must, mark births and deaths and help each other through the dark times. Lucky maybe. My neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. We pass mail back and forth like old friends. Good to see them, good to be seen. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make me think I aint wasted my life after all.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something less defined. Our quarter sits on the eastern edge where the houses stand weathered and dim like tired sentinels. Here the people make do with less. They rent mostly. Some own. All of them carrying the weight of thin wallets and thinner prospects.\n\nThe streets aint hostile though. Folk nod and speak when you pass. They carry their poverty like old clothes, worn but dignified. Violence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome relative that wont stay gone. Shots ring out in the night. Bodies fall. The neighbors boy went down outside a bar last year, his blood soaking into earth that holds no memory of such things. We lost nothing save what thieves took from the porch, small items left too long in the open air.\n\nThe poison that runs through the veins of America runs here too. Fentanyl. A devil's bargain paid in dead sons and daughters. The town tries to fight it with clinics and training, teaching people how to bring back the nearly dead. Some come back. Some dont.\n\nYet there's grace here too. The schoolhouse where my boy goes stands like a sanctuary. The teachers there, they dont see his difference as something broken. They work with a kind of fierce gentleness. No child goes hungry there. They feed them all the same, rich or poor, no matter. The families come together, plan things, make it better than it has to be.\n\nThe town council, they try. New roads get laid. Parks bloom where wreckage stood. But their attention drifts west like the setting sun, toward the shopping strips and the money. Our side stays forgotten, like an old photograph nobody looks at anymore.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint much but it holds us. Keeps the rain out. Keeps us together. Sometimes I think about leaving but the thought feels wrong, like trying to wear someone else's skin. This place, broken as it is, it's home. And home aint perfect but it's where you know the broken places by heart and love them anyway.",
            "The neighborhood stands upon the hill like some ancient altar, its weathered buildings bearing witness to histories untold. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater looms dark and quiet, its marquee dead in the day. Down The Hill there's a place where games sing their electric songs and people gather like moths to flame in the summer dark, queued in long serpentine lines that wind through the streets of June and July.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast and empty save for the concrete that circles it like a grey noose, steps carved into its face like ancient hieroglyphs. Winter brings the dispossessed, their nylon shelters arrayed in geometric precision along the walks and stairs, huddled against the rain that falls eternal and cold. No snow comes but the water falls merciless and without cease, driving them together like cattle in a storm. They cluster near the family center where steam rises from showers and sinks, their only refuge in miles of urban wilderness.\n\nBut it aint the proud buildings nor the hills that roll like waves toward the far Pacific that make this place. It's the people carrying their histories like old wounds. Hilltop they call it, where once blood ran in gutters and gangs ruled like medieval lords. Federal men came through like locusts, badges glinting, sweeping clean what could not be cleaned. The stories persist, passed down like dark gospels, father to son, mother to daughter, and to newcomers like myself who listen in the shadows.\n\nThe people here bear their burden proud, though outsiders still whisper warnings about white folk walking these streets after dark. But such words carry the stink of old fears and older hatreds. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass, or maybe these streets know their own. They know who sees the truth of this nation's sins, the racism and fear that prowl like hungry dogs even in this supposed paradise of cultures.\n\nThese streets are home now. I've walked them in darkness and found not threat but sanctuary. Seen strangers offer warmth instead of violence. Watched laundry workers extend mercy in small measures of time and electricity. Felt the concrete against my back on grey nights when the world seemed empty, only to find some angel of the streets pressing crumpled dollars in my palm, speaking beauty into existence like some urban prophet.\n\nThis is Hilltop. These are my people now.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade commenced, the houses standing like silent sentinels in the August heat. Making friends dont come easy to a boy in a strange place but there was two of them lived nearby, one two doors down and another somewhere along the dusty street though neither walks these roads no more. The old guard remains mostly, their faces weathered like the vinyl siding that adorns these two-story dwellings that could be anywhere in America.\n\nThe children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off empty porches where packages sit unmolested like offerings to some suburban god. Trust here is a currency spent careful and rare but somehow it endures. The neighbors keep to themselves save when help is needed, like some unspoken covenant carved in sidewalk chalk.\n\nThere's a park not far, maybe two minutes walking. Basketball hoops stand like gallows in the fading light, bearing witness to countless games played out on cracked concrete. Football too, and baseball, though one day the park took its toll when an elbow found my nose in a spray of crimson. But good memories outweigh the bad like gold outweighs lead. Now I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them climb and swing like monkeys in a concrete jungle, their joy pure and unfiltered as spring water.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though most folks now summon their meals through glowing screens and wait for strangers to bring sustenance to their doors. Fast food joints squat on corners like toads, identical to their brothers in every other suburb across this vast land. Pizza places too, more than any man could count.\n\nThe stores stand shoulder to shoulder offering their wares - dry cleaners with their chemical smell, the twin pharmacies facing each other like duelists, the Jewel-Osco where the Midwest does its marketing. There's even an Indian store that smells of cardamom and cumin and holds secrets in glass jars.\n\nI've grown fond of this place. The horror stories that float across screens and airwaves of neighbor turned against neighbor make me grateful for this peace, this quiet understanding we've built here. This is my home now, for better or worse, and I reckon that's something worth holding onto.",
            "The college stands near where I live and that's good enough. Concrete rises up in blocks and squares, apartments stacked like ancient pueblos but with neon signs for bars hanging off their faces. One bar changed its name. More expensive now but the liquor still burns the same. The people here exist in two tribes: students with their backpacks and textbooks, and the poor folk who've found refuge in these cheap walls. Children too, their voices echoing off brick and mortar near the schoolyard.\n\nMy neighbors I don't know and don't care to know. The sweet sick smell of their smoking seeps through walls and the management's mounted some plastic contraption that spits artificial pine into the hallway like some kind of joke against nature. The buildings stand tired, weathered, their insides gutted and remade but their faces still showing age like old men. Down the road they've built new ones, all glass and promise, but the walls are thin as paper and the rent is highway robbery. They know the students will come anyway.\n\nThere's a place serves food on paper plates, everything heated in the microwave's blue glow. Gas station across the way. Bad place to work they say. City money came through last summer, laid down concrete in wide strips, planted grass in neat rows like a cemetery. Trees shadow my building, some cut down to stumps like broken teeth, but more still standing than down the road. Behind us lies another street, 43rd, meaner and darker than ours. Concrete broken and heaved up like earth after a quake. Buildings there wear their decay like badges. Crime flows through there like water in a wash, but it spills over here too sometimes, touching everything.\n\nBut I stay. The rent doesn't break me and I can walk to class through the trees. Buses come and go like mechanical mules, carrying people to stores and downtown, all of us moving through this concrete maze we've built, all of us pretending we're going somewhere better.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end street, white porches gleaming under metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses. Regular houses where regular folk lived and breathed and died. Most evenings we gather, not by design or schedule but by some ancient calling, standing in drives while young ones mark the concrete with chalk colors or chase kites against the dying light. Like some forgotten time. Like the world hadnt gone mad with its screens and its wires.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the blue sky where clouds move like white buffalo across the plains. But the sky carries darkness too. Last night the sirens wailed their terrible song and we knew what was coming. The sound like some biblical horn calling judgment. I took my little dog and my purse and some pillows into the bathtub while the big dog, wild with fear, paced and barked in the living room like he could ward off what was coming.\n\nThe hail came. Hard pellets of ice striking the earth like shot, the neighborhood gone quiet save for this percussion from above. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cool, temperature falling seventeen degrees in minutes that felt like seconds. The sun broke through and rain fell still and a double rainbow appeared like God's own signature across the sky. I photographed it quick, shared it with people I knew who lived in screens.\n\nThe houses stand identical but inside theyre different as fingerprints. Some small as shoeboxes though you wouldnt know it. Behind my place theres a pond not for swimming and a field where deer ghost through the morning fog. Bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns at dawn while roosters crow from farms unseen, and sometimes in the evening a donkey brays his lonely song like some testament to solitude. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be forty years from anywhere. A village unto itself. I found it like you might find an arrowhead in fresh turned soil, this place, this neighborhood, this home.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Memory holds like a fist round the throat. The move from Riverdale to Stockbridge came with tears salt and bitter, the kind that burn tracks down young cheeks in the dark. Mother and father spoke of better things. Better schools. Better houses. Places where the streets dont carry the weight of what they called ghetto. As if words could wash clean what was already written.\n\nTime passed like wind through dead grass. Friends came. Enemies too. The neighbors kept to themselves save for Mr Glen and Dennis whose houses pressed against ours like books on a shelf. Mr Glen got himself married again and we went to the wedding, my sister and parents and me watching this new beginning like witnesses to some ancient rite. Ms Veda in white, her garter sailing through air thick with hope and landing in my hands while the flowers found another's grasp. We danced. All of us. Marsharii, Glen's daughter, moved like smoke in lamplight. Never saw her after. The world takes what it wants.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads like a wound, streets tangled as veins. GPS helps now but before it was all wandering. Me and Kason and Curtis spent days in digital worlds, controllers warm in our hands like prayer beads. Sometimes the park calls with its green silence. I go there with sticks from the hardware store, practice balance like some warrior monk. The wooden sword, the bokken, makes music in the air. Basketball courts and tennis courts wait empty as church pews. Memory again: Dad and Mr Graves teaching tennis, the sun watching like an old god while we learned the religion of the serve and volley.\n\nTheres more. Always more. Stories pile like autumn leaves but these stick harder than most. What comes next waits in the dark like all futures do. Patient. Hungry.",
            "The town lay there like something forgotten by God. Not special among the countless other specks that dotted South Carolina save for what grew from its soil. Johnston. The Peach Capital of the World, or so proclaimed the weathered sign that greeted wayfarers, its paint peeling like dead skin in the merciless southern sun.\n\nFields stretched out beyond sight, an endless sea of peach trees or cattle, depending on which way you turned your head. Houses stood apart from one another like estranged kin, most two stories tall with metal roofs that reflected the savage summer heat or gray shingles dark as storm clouds. They squatted far back from the road, letting their front acres birth crops or sustain beasts that moved like shadows across the land.\n\nThe town proper centered around a single stoplight that swayed like a hanged man above a four-way crossing. Here stood the meager offerings of commerce: Hong Kong, where a single family cooked behind steamed windows; Fiesta Mexican, its neon sign flickering in the dusk; and Gary's, where burgers were served with a side of small-town desperation. The pizzeria was gone now, its windows dark as cave mouths.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug endured, known more for its Cherry Coca-Cola than any medicine it dispensed. The IGA grocery stood like a fortress of overpriced necessities, though most folks made the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, as if seeking salvation in better prices. Dollar General thrived like a weed in rich soil, its parking lot never empty from dawn till dusk.\n\nThe furniture store, Possibilities, run by a woman whose kindness seemed anachronistic in these times, shared walls with Clark's Cuts and Kennels where dogs went in dirty and came out clean. A doctor and a vet practiced their trades on the outskirts, tending to the living things that still remained.\n\nChildren learned their letters at Johnston Elementary until fifth grade sent them away to the next town over, like young birds pushed from the nest. No parks existed yet, though men spoke of one coming, 2.5 acres of promised land for families to gather and visitors to admire. No picture shows, no bowling alleys, no place for youth to congregate except empty parking lots and abandoned fields. Just a town you could miss between heartbeats, there and gone like a dream you can't quite remember come morning.",
            "We live here where the asphalt runs between two highways, a tributary of progress cutting through what was once ancient wood. The traffic passes like blood through veins. Constant. Relentless. The houses stand like sentinels, their occupants as permanent as the seasons, their faces known to me as my own. They tend their rectangular plots of earth like penitents, mowing and raking and burning in cyclical devotion to some suburban god.\n\nThe house sits at the corner where the road bends, watching. Always watching. Four souls dwell within its walls. Me. The wife. Two daughters with ages hanging off them like price tags in a time-worn shop. Eleven. Fourteen. Numbers that mean everything and nothing.\n\nIn winter the children drag their plastic sleds up the hill on the side street, their breath hanging in clouds above them like steam from locomotives long dead. We know every vehicle that passes, their shapes and sounds as familiar as scripture. The strange ones stand out like wolves among sheep.\n\nThe walkers come and go, leading their dogs on strings of leather and nylon. Children pedal their mechanical steeds through the gathering dusk. We work from home, our presence as constant as the sun. Sometimes we stand in the rain like wild things, letting the water wash away the domesticity that clings to us like moss.\n\nSmoke rises from the grill out back, meat offerings to the sky. The sound of mowers echoes from March through October like mechanical locusts, the grass growing and dying in its appointed time. The trees stand ancient and tall, their leaves a constant reminder of what this place used to be. Come autumn they shed their burden and we burn them, the smoke carrying memories of forests long forgotten.\n\nWinter comes seldom now, as if the season itself has lost its way. The garage stands behind like a concrete cave, its doors opening to the neighborhood like eyes. I work there on my truck, steel and grease becoming meditation. The holidays bring strangers' cars, clustered like fallen leaves in driveways and along curbs, their owners gathering inside homes like moths to flame.\n\nThis is where we are. This is what we've become. The road runs through like a river of tar, carrying pieces of the world past our door. If it were not for this current of steel and rubber, this place might be perfect. But perfection died with the trees that once stood here, and we are left with what remains.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast and ancient thing, all dirt and dust and more dirt still, a brown expanse that knows no end. Those who aint lived here cant know it, cant understand what it means to see nothing but brown forever and when you do spy a patch of green lawn you know that man has paid dearly for his small victory over nature. Back in the nineties the houses stood alone like sentinels in the waste but now they've multiplied like some concrete plague though the spaces between them still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like a living thing, consuming the desert day by day though I reckon thats the way of all places now. Good folk mostly, though like anywhere the darkness in men's hearts can poison a place. My patch is ringed with the old ones, quiet folk who mind their business and tend their days. The stores are all chains, soulless boxes with names like Food For Less and Smart and Final, and if you want something fine you got to drive and drive far. No Whole Foods here. No sir.\n\nConstruction rules this land. Men with hammers and nails building dreams in the dust, filling the empty spaces with wood and metal and hope. Sometimes I look out and see the vacant lots diminishing and it puts a fear in me. I fled the big city and dont aim to live in one again. I know construction. Its my trade. Drywall and ceiling grids, marking the boundaries between inside and out.\n\nThe animals here, they got their own order. Folk come to the high desert for many reasons but chief among them is the stark and terrible beauty of it all. The land shapes what lives here, cruel and unforgiving, creating creatures that survive despite all odds. We who choose to live here must learn their ways or perish. My young ones, they've taken to it like they was born to it. Three of them out there now hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen.\n\nThe county fair comes once a year, bringing noise and light to the quiet places. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like some white judgment, and folks learn to slide down it for sport. Down at the Victor Valley Museum they keep the bones and artifacts, pieces of the past locked behind glass, telling stories of the people who tried to tame this land before us. But the desert, it just keeps on being what it is, unchanging and eternal, watching us come and go like dust in the wind.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete desert, buildings rising up from the earth like worn monoliths. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of, with white picket fences and children's bicycles laid against garage doors. No. This here's my home all the same, dormitory walls containing multitudes, souls stacked one atop another in this strange vertical community.\n\nThe buildings stand sentinel. Three kinds there are, each serving its purpose in this concrete congregation. First come the apartments, squared off and efficient, holding twenty souls or thereabouts, stacked two floors high like some modern pueblo dwelling. Then there's the proper houses, scattered rare as gold teeth, where them that's affiliated with the school might lay their heads. Alumni mostly, living in these relics of conventional dwelling. Last and most numerous are the dormitories themselves, great rectangular hives where hundreds sleep and dream and study, two to a cell like some voluntary prison of learning.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds moving through the spaces between buildings like blood through veins. The old ones, the professors and such, they claim them scattered houses while young blood fills the dorms and apartments according to their station, like some unspoken caste system that everyone understands but nobody mentions.\n\nAnd commerce thrives here too, stores dealing in sustenance and school pride, feeding and clothing this strange tribe. There's a park too, though calling it such seems wrong somehow - more like a shared space where all these disparate souls come together under the same sky, keeping it clean and safe like some communal obligation to decency.\n\nThis aint no regular neighborhood but it serves the same purpose as any other. A place where people live and die and try to make sense of their small piece of the world. And maybe that's all any neighborhood really is, when you strip away the pretense and convention.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set his hand against it, and the house stands sentinel at the peak of the steepest grade. They call it the workout hill. Runners come and go like penitents climbing to salvation. The street bare and broken, pocked with time and weather. Above, the electric lines hang like old rope, spliced and mended where storm and branch have had their way with them. Repairs upon repairs. The evergreens stand dark against the sky but folk here despise them, cut them down with a fury born of blocked views, as if the trees themselves conspired against their dominion over the sea-sight.\n\nThe houses rise like glass temples to the water below, stacked one above the other in their reaching. At sunset the bay burns copper and gold but most days the light filters gray through the constant veil of clouds that hang like funeral shrouds over the land. The damp brings moss, green and ancient, claiming every surface left untended. Cars, roofs, railings all submit to its quiet conquest.\n\nNo children here. The old ones have claimed this ground, the retired and the waiting. Dogs rule these streets now, running wild and free, crossing boundaries at will. They enter homes unbidden, like thieves testing doors. Found one once in the parlor, standing there like it owned the place. The rabbits too have their dominion, great beasts that war with the gardeners for control of the earth itself. The cats hunt them with ancient instinct, keeping their numbers in check. Birds wheel overhead - sparrow, hummingbird, hawk and eagle all - until the crows, black-winged arbiters of the sky, drive them hence.\n\nDown the hill where land meets water stand the restaurants, serving up the ocean's bounty. No proper beach exists, just rocks dark with spray that wait to be cast into the waters. The bay stretches narrow, the far shore a constant presence through the mist like some half-remembered dream.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some concrete testament to the city's endless hunger, stretching out beneath a gray sky that hung low and heavy as a shroud. You could find it easy enough. The trains came and went like iron serpents through the borough's veins, carrying the masses in their steel bellies.\n\nThe streets told stories of change. Where once Italian voices echoed off brick walls now came the sound of Asian tongues, strange and melodic in the morning air. Every block bore witness to this transformation, storefronts with characters etched in scripts ancient as civilization itself. Markets sprouted like weeds through concrete, four within spitting distance of each other, their shelves heavy with goods from across the Pacific. The people came and they built and they stayed.\n\nA park stood renovated, new as sin. Basketball courts stretched out like dominoes, ten of them, and beyond lay fields where children played at games older than memory. Water sprayed from fountains in summer, baptizing the young who shrieked and ran through the mist. All colors of humanity gathered there, as if the world had been poured into one vessel and left to settle.\n\nThe buildings squatted low, mostly two-family affairs, no corporate towers reaching for god here. Music blasted from cars day and night, engines roaring like wounded beasts, their drivers pressing pedals to metal as if pursued by demons unseen. The night brought its own terrors. Though safety wrapped the neighborhood like a thin blanket, violence lurked in shadows, waiting patient as a spider. Thieves prowled for packages left like offerings on doorsteps, and bullies stalked the streets seeking quarrel without cause.\n\nDog waste dotted the sidewalks like landmines, ignored by their keepers despite the city's proclamations against such things. Signs posted meant nothing to those who viewed rules as suggestions meant for others. The morning light revealed these deposits like bitter testimonies to man's indifference, waiting for the unwary shoe to discover their presence.",
            "First thing about Portland Oregon is what they mean by weird. Word's painted up on some building downtown, serving pizza and spirits and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws they dont even know exist yet. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk remember when weird meant something else, back in the nineties when the streets were emptier and rent was cheap and art grew wild in the cracks like weeds. Others hear it like a siren song calling them home at last.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their steel and glass boxes reaching up into the grey sky but the weird abides. Not the kind of weird that opens its arms to everything but the kind that shelters what other places cast out. We got our Walmart same as anywhere. Got our Amazon boxes piled on porches. But theres something else too.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand like desert flowers painted colors that dont exist in nature. Gardens grow thick and wild right up to the sidewalk, herbs and tomatoes free for the taking. And the free boxes. Lord the free boxes. Cardboard testimonies to what people leave behind, little altars of abandonment that sometimes hold treasure for them that look. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes things you cant name, things that might be exactly what you needed without knowing you needed it.\n\nSome folks here do their yoga with goats. Real goats walking around on their backs while they stretch out like lizards in the sun. Some paint their faces and scream at soccer matches like its the end times. Some just drink. The rain comes down most days, gray and eternal as god's own tears, and it gets in your head after a while. Makes people strange. Makes em sick sometimes.\n\nGot our share of lost souls too, sleeping in doorways and under bridges. City tries to help but helping aint ever enough. Rest of us watch em, sometimes with pity sometimes with rage, same as anywhere else. In that way we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stand in the north like ancient gods. Watching. Always watching. The mountains bear witness to each dawn and dusk as the sun makes its weary pilgrimage across the heavens, indifferent to the struggles of men below. A man forgets them sometimes. Gets caught in the machinations of his daily bread. But they remain. Unchanging. Unmoved. When the spirit grows weak and the mind turns to rust they command attention with their stark permanence, offering what solace stone can give to flesh.\n\nI came here young. A student. The university stretched below them mountains like some grand experiment in civilization, all brick and mortar and manufactured pools where turtles and waterfowl went about their primitive rituals. Downtown the old buildings wore their faded colors like badges of former glory. Coffee houses full of young scholars burning midnight oil, their faces lit by screens in the dark. The streets there pulse with an energy that mocks the quiet suburbs beyond, where the library stands sentinel between two worlds.\n\nThis town holds memories like a collector holds artifacts. Some precious. Some better left buried. Nights spent with companions on rusted playground swings. Racing through streets toward picture shows in that gaudy theater where students went free. But there were darker times too. Times when a man might find himself at the edge of them ponds in the dark hours, questioning his place in the order of things while ducks slept on black water.\n\nOne such morning I walked. Past houses neat as tombs. Past empty parks. The sun coming up like a copper coin through them palm trees, painting the sky colors that aint got proper names. My feet carried me north without thinking, like they knew some truth my mind had forgot. And there they stood. Them mountains cutting into the dawn sky like they was put there by whatever hand first shaped this world. They spoke without speaking. Said what they always said. About enduring. About going on. And that was enough.",
            "You'd pass it by and think nothing of it. Nothing there worth seeing. Residential block behind some shops like ten thousand others in ten thousand towns. But beyond where the old Whole Foods stands empty and past them hotels that fill only when summer brings the reunions of kin long scattered, there's life. Real life. Moving and breathing like something alive ought to.\n\nThe apartments rise like ancient things. Like clay figures some god done lined up and forgot. First ones got darkness in em. Evil maybe. Papers tell stories bout whats happened there but evil aint always where you think it lives. Next ones different though. Three blocks of em standing quiet and unknown to most folks round here. Watching.\n\nCross the way theres this college. Small thing. Branch of something bigger somewhere else. Students drift in through gates that cry out in rust and iron voices while the morning traffic builds up behind em like water behind a dam. Cars honking. People cursing. Sun climbing.\n\nRoad ends at another. T-shaped like a crucified thing. Park on one side. Medical place on the other where they fix broken bodies. Got chairs out front where nobody sits cept the air moving through the fan blades above. Park's got kids in it most days. Running like wild things through grass sharp as needles. Bees moving drunk through flowers by the road. Old folks walking dogs, giving mean looks to boys on boards with wheels, nodding to girls who cluster like birds and talk about nothing that'll matter come winter.\n\nStrip mall squats nearby. Sushi place. Pool store. Women painting nails. All of it together like it grew that way natural. Frozen yogurt too, where them kids go after they done trying to break their bones on concrete. They stand there breathing sweet poison from metal tubes thinking they invented rebellion.\n\nAll of it there like some picture of what America supposed to be. Time dont touch it much. South moving slow like molasses, holding onto what it knows, keeping what it's got. Same as it ever was. Same as it'll be.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames, bearing witness to times past and times passing. A small yard stretches before mine, driveway running alongside like a pale scar in the earth. These dwellings, all of them, they speak of dreams that once coursed through the veins of the nation like fever. Dreams that now recede like shadows at dawn, yet leave their mark upon the land and those who dwell here.\n\nThe people tend their patches of earth with less vigor now, their hopes dimmed but not extinguished. Automobiles rest in driveways like sleeping beasts. Children play in the streets, their world bounded by the horizon of their understanding, their games ancient as time itself. The schoolhouse stands, ninety years of brick and mortar and memory, drawing youth forward while pulling at the threads of remembrance in the old. Churches stand empty as bleached bones while the basketball courts pulse with life and motion.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years, the same burden of story. Super A stands sentinel at the corner, run by Yemeni folk, Arab blood in a sea of black faces. Wide streets stretch like rivers between the homes, young boys playing at their football till cars pass like great metal fish through their games. Generations deep the people here, their stories flowing like water through time, telling of days when neighbor knew neighbor and all was known.\n\nWhere once stood the karate school now stands the pharmacy, testament to how dreams change shape, how chemical comfort replaced the warrior's way. The movie house endures, showing ghosts of celluloid past at prices that dont pain the pocket, shunned by the young who chase newer phantoms but embraced by the old who remember when stories moved slower through the world.\n\nThe expressway passes like a great metal serpent, but touches not this ground. The old ones saw to that, wisdom or fear guiding their hands when they turned away the promise of progress. New school rising from the earth now, while they debate what manner of creature shall represent them. Some speak of metal men with country ways and log cabin dreams, as if such things could capture the truth of this place where past and present dance their eternal dance.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, its streets a tangled mass of concrete and steel where dwellings and commerce bleed into one another without rhythm or reason. Here stand the edifices of trade, glass-fronted and cold, there the eateries and shops strung like beads on an endless thread. The corporations have their temples here, great branded fortresses, but so too do the small merchants ply their trade in dim storefronts, their windows dusty with hope.\n\nThe parks persist like green wounds in the gray flesh of streets. Children come here. Their mothers watch. All around the streets pulse with the blood of many nations. The queers have carved their territory here, as have the Jews in their black coats and hats, and the scattered remnants of the fallen Soviet empire. Beyond lie the other tribes in their own marked territories. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. All pressed together yet separate, like oil floating on water.\n\nTen miles might as well be a hundred. The cars move like dying things through the arteries of the city, sometimes taking hours to crawl what a man could walk in thirty minutes. But none walk here. The city's vastness forbids it. The machines rule these roads and the people sit captive in their metal boxes, searching endlessly for some small square of earth to abandon their vehicles upon.\n\nThey build upward now, great towers of glass and concrete rising like concrete stalagmites from the earth. The people come and still they come, and those already here watch with dead eyes as the streets grow fuller, the air thicker, the spaces between things smaller.\n\nHouses stand in their various forms. Some squat alone on their plots while others are stacked like children's blocks, divided into cells where families make their lives. The people who dwell in them are strangers to one another, passing like ghosts, nodding without seeing. Time was when children played in these streets, when neighbors knew neighbors. But that time has passed into memory, as thin and fragile as smoke in the wind.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stretched out beyond sight like a yellow sea frozen in time. This is what there is, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before. Coming from streets where grocers stood shoulder to shoulder with barbershops and laundromats, this emptiness was foreign to her. Strange. I told her tales of my youth in these Ohio fields and she listened quiet-like, understanding finally the place that shaped me.\n\nPast endless rows of corn a water-filled quarry appears like some ancient wound in the earth. Beyond it lies the place I call home. Houses of brick and stucco stand sentinel over half-acre plots, each yard maintained with religious devotion. Spring brings forth flowers planted by careful hands while the trees mark time's passing with their changing colors. Mercedes automobiles line driveways like chrome sentinels, their surfaces catching sunlight like mirrors after washing.\n\nThe Korean man tends his grass daily, singing songs from his homeland over the mechanical drone of his mower. Once a healer of men, now he tends to simpler things. Age has taken its toll but left his genuine nature intact. He moves across his lawn like a ghost, one with his machine.\n\nMy house stands grey against the sky. Geese patrol the side yard while our small terrier gives chase, both locked in some eternal dance. A stream whispers past, feeding the quarry's waters. Bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns while cattle low in distant fields. Cross the wooden bridge I built with my own hands and you'll find yourself in a wilderness untouched by man's intentions. Trees and wildflowers grow as God intended.\n\nThis was my kingdom as a child. Built forts in those trees. Stalked imaginary prey through those woods. Other children would appear and disappear like phantoms, companions in our wild games.\n\nWinter comes harsh here. Beautiful and merciless both. The yard transforms into something ancient and empty. Trees that once bloomed now stand like condemned men waiting execution. Snow comes in the night like some divine blanket. My sister's snow angels appear like messages from heaven, while snowmen stand guard over our domain. We warred with snowballs, building fortresses from packed snow and fallen branches, arsenals for our childhood battles. In that frozen realm we played at life, ignorant of the world beyond our snow-fort walls, innocent of time's passing."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland meets them tourist towns like old friends meeting at a crossroads. Ain't no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores standing sentinel over parking lots vast as prairie. To get anywhere you got to drive and drive through land that God himself must've took extra care in making. Water everywhere. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them like great mirrors laid down by some forgotten race of giants.\n\nThe houses here dont march in rows like soldiers. They stand apart from one another like old men who've known each other too long to need to crowd. Some got new faces, some wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the earth like root cellars waiting for some apocalypse that aint come yet. The siding's mostly aluminum, weathered and wore. Colors everywhere. Like God spilled his paint box across these streets.\n\nYards stretch out wide enough for dreams to grow. Trampolines stand like black circles against the sky, swing sets rust in the Michigan air. Gardens grow where folks plant them, and fences hold whatever needs holding. These houses speak of work and time and children grown and children growing still.\n\nYou'll see them running these streets like wild things. Dogs and bikes and skaters passing like shadows. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. They wave from their grills, smoke rising like prayers into the evening air. They nod from their porches like judges on their benches.\n\nThe lawns stay neat cause that's the way of things here. No dead leaves sleeping past their time. No grass growing wild and wrong. Everything trimmed and proper like it ought to be. Ain't beautiful in the way that makes rich folks stop their cars and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes a man feel right about raising his children here.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, and the health department, and the place where they sort through what folks throw away. Baseball games echo through the streets, the names of children carried on the wind like birds. Planes come and go from the little airport, their engines growling at the sky. Ice cream waits downtown for them that want to walk for it. The park stands eight blocks distant, like some promised land for children on their bikes.\n\nThis here's a good place. A right place. The kind of place where the world makes sense, even when nothing else does.",
            "They built it like all the others. Row after row of houses stamped from the same mold, each yard a mirror of the next with its patch of grass and scattered stones and driveways that could scarce hold two cars lengthwise. The trees were young yet, planted at intervals decided by men who'd never live there, their branches reaching skyward like supplicants before a stern god.\n\nThe homeowners association ruled here with invisible hands. Their commandments writ in bylaws and covenants that shaped the very air folk breathed. Two-car garages stood sentinel, doors aligned like soldiers at attention. The roads were smooth as glass, unmarred by time or weather, as if decay itself had been legislated away.\n\nMailboxes gathered in clusters at the street ends, metal sentries requiring keys to yield their secrets. Package lockers stood larger among them, warehouse to the commerce of modern life. The neighborhood pressed against the city's edge where civilization met wilderness, though wilderness here meant planned pools behind iron gates and trails that wound through manufactured wilderness like asphalt snakes.\n\nThe people who dwelt here were mostly old, their working years behind them. They watched from windows and porches, guardians of a peace they'd bought with retirement checks and social security. Mixed among them were the younger ones, professionals with briefcases and smart phones who'd sought refuge in this ordered world.\n\nThe city beyond sprawled vast yet maintained pretenses of small-town life, like a wolf in sheep's wool. One mall stood testament to commerce, neither grand nor humble, serving its purpose like a dutiful servant. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction led to the familiar totems of American life - grocery stores selling organic salvation at premium prices, discount temples with skeleton crews trading low prices for fluorescent sterility.\n\nIt was a place carved from chaos into order, maintained by rules and money and the fear of disorder. Safe as a vault, clean as a hospital, predictable as sunrise. A place where people could walk their dogs or themselves and never fear getting lost, where every need was met so long as you could drive fifteen minutes to meet it.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through digital ether like phantom radio. Strange thing to hear. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more per moon and none Id known had heard such tales. Maybe its the weight of living crushing down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper, friends trying to hold together against the dark. Everything costs dear now but we learned to stretch what little we got. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, musty toys and clothes sealed away in time. Your nose forgets what it once knew. Some take to tobacco, others just stop noticing. But the fleamarket smell it dont ever leave you be. Adulthood smells like yellowed paper stacked on dead pianos, that smell that works its way into leather and wont wash out no matter what you do.\n\nThree stores selling old things within walking distance. Starting far out you can make your way through charity shops and libraries and places selling rare books and curious things. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but in them old stores time stands still. Silent as tombs no matter the chaos outside. Good place to lose yourself. More folks come each year, more machines too. They call it progress. Some big company dealing in bits and screens made its home here and the city aint settled into its new skin yet. Makes me think of New York. Everyone got their own purpose and dont nobody ask much of nobody else. You can wrap yourself in silence and solitude and aint nobody gonna try tear that away. Not like down South where concern means care. Here you keep to yourself and the city rolls past like waves on sand.\n\nLife goes on though. Got a piano player next door and two who fancy themselves singers up above. Less strangers more like family now. We come together when needs must, mark births and deaths and help each other through the dark times. Lucky maybe. My neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. We pass mail back and forth like old friends. Good to see them, good to be seen. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make me think I aint wasted my life after all.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something less defined. Our quarter sits on the eastern edge where the houses stand weathered and dim like tired sentinels. Here the people make do with less. They rent mostly. Some own. All of them carrying the weight of thin wallets and thinner prospects.\n\nThe streets aint hostile though. Folk nod and speak when you pass. They carry their poverty like old clothes, worn but dignified. Violence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome relative that wont stay gone. Shots ring out in the night. Bodies fall. The neighbors boy went down outside a bar last year, his blood soaking into earth that holds no memory of such things. We lost nothing save what thieves took from the porch, small items left too long in the open air.\n\nThe poison that runs through the veins of America runs here too. Fentanyl. A devil's bargain paid in dead sons and daughters. The town tries to fight it with clinics and training, teaching people how to bring back the nearly dead. Some come back. Some dont.\n\nYet there's grace here too. The schoolhouse where my boy goes stands like a sanctuary. The teachers there, they dont see his difference as something broken. They work with a kind of fierce gentleness. No child goes hungry there. They feed them all the same, rich or poor, no matter. The families come together, plan things, make it better than it has to be.\n\nThe town council, they try. New roads get laid. Parks bloom where wreckage stood. But their attention drifts west like the setting sun, toward the shopping strips and the money. Our side stays forgotten, like an old photograph nobody looks at anymore.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint much but it holds us. Keeps the rain out. Keeps us together. Sometimes I think about leaving but the thought feels wrong, like trying to wear someone else's skin. This place, broken as it is, it's home. And home aint perfect but it's where you know the broken places by heart and love them anyway.",
            "The neighborhood stands upon the hill like some ancient altar, its weathered buildings bearing witness to histories untold. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater looms dark and quiet, its marquee dead in the day. Down The Hill there's a place where games sing their electric songs and people gather like moths to flame in the summer dark, queued in long serpentine lines that wind through the streets of June and July.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast and empty save for the concrete that circles it like a grey noose, steps carved into its face like ancient hieroglyphs. Winter brings the dispossessed, their nylon shelters arrayed in geometric precision along the walks and stairs, huddled against the rain that falls eternal and cold. No snow comes but the water falls merciless and without cease, driving them together like cattle in a storm. They cluster near the family center where steam rises from showers and sinks, their only refuge in miles of urban wilderness.\n\nBut it aint the proud buildings nor the hills that roll like waves toward the far Pacific that make this place. It's the people carrying their histories like old wounds. Hilltop they call it, where once blood ran in gutters and gangs ruled like medieval lords. Federal men came through like locusts, badges glinting, sweeping clean what could not be cleaned. The stories persist, passed down like dark gospels, father to son, mother to daughter, and to newcomers like myself who listen in the shadows.\n\nThe people here bear their burden proud, though outsiders still whisper warnings about white folk walking these streets after dark. But such words carry the stink of old fears and older hatreds. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass, or maybe these streets know their own. They know who sees the truth of this nation's sins, the racism and fear that prowl like hungry dogs even in this supposed paradise of cultures.\n\nThese streets are home now. I've walked them in darkness and found not threat but sanctuary. Seen strangers offer warmth instead of violence. Watched laundry workers extend mercy in small measures of time and electricity. Felt the concrete against my back on grey nights when the world seemed empty, only to find some angel of the streets pressing crumpled dollars in my palm, speaking beauty into existence like some urban prophet.\n\nThis is Hilltop. These are my people now.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade commenced, the houses standing like silent sentinels in the August heat. Making friends dont come easy to a boy in a strange place but there was two of them lived nearby, one two doors down and another somewhere along the dusty street though neither walks these roads no more. The old guard remains mostly, their faces weathered like the vinyl siding that adorns these two-story dwellings that could be anywhere in America.\n\nThe children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off empty porches where packages sit unmolested like offerings to some suburban god. Trust here is a currency spent careful and rare but somehow it endures. The neighbors keep to themselves save when help is needed, like some unspoken covenant carved in sidewalk chalk.\n\nThere's a park not far, maybe two minutes walking. Basketball hoops stand like gallows in the fading light, bearing witness to countless games played out on cracked concrete. Football too, and baseball, though one day the park took its toll when an elbow found my nose in a spray of crimson. But good memories outweigh the bad like gold outweighs lead. Now I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them climb and swing like monkeys in a concrete jungle, their joy pure and unfiltered as spring water.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though most folks now summon their meals through glowing screens and wait for strangers to bring sustenance to their doors. Fast food joints squat on corners like toads, identical to their brothers in every other suburb across this vast land. Pizza places too, more than any man could count.\n\nThe stores stand shoulder to shoulder offering their wares - dry cleaners with their chemical smell, the twin pharmacies facing each other like duelists, the Jewel-Osco where the Midwest does its marketing. There's even an Indian store that smells of cardamom and cumin and holds secrets in glass jars.\n\nI've grown fond of this place. The horror stories that float across screens and airwaves of neighbor turned against neighbor make me grateful for this peace, this quiet understanding we've built here. This is my home now, for better or worse, and I reckon that's something worth holding onto.",
            "The college stands near where I live and that's good enough. Concrete rises up in blocks and squares, apartments stacked like ancient pueblos but with neon signs for bars hanging off their faces. One bar changed its name. More expensive now but the liquor still burns the same. The people here exist in two tribes: students with their backpacks and textbooks, and the poor folk who've found refuge in these cheap walls. Children too, their voices echoing off brick and mortar near the schoolyard.\n\nMy neighbors I don't know and don't care to know. The sweet sick smell of their smoking seeps through walls and the management's mounted some plastic contraption that spits artificial pine into the hallway like some kind of joke against nature. The buildings stand tired, weathered, their insides gutted and remade but their faces still showing age like old men. Down the road they've built new ones, all glass and promise, but the walls are thin as paper and the rent is highway robbery. They know the students will come anyway.\n\nThere's a place serves food on paper plates, everything heated in the microwave's blue glow. Gas station across the way. Bad place to work they say. City money came through last summer, laid down concrete in wide strips, planted grass in neat rows like a cemetery. Trees shadow my building, some cut down to stumps like broken teeth, but more still standing than down the road. Behind us lies another street, 43rd, meaner and darker than ours. Concrete broken and heaved up like earth after a quake. Buildings there wear their decay like badges. Crime flows through there like water in a wash, but it spills over here too sometimes, touching everything.\n\nBut I stay. The rent doesn't break me and I can walk to class through the trees. Buses come and go like mechanical mules, carrying people to stores and downtown, all of us moving through this concrete maze we've built, all of us pretending we're going somewhere better.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end street, white porches gleaming under metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses. Regular houses where regular folk lived and breathed and died. Most evenings we gather, not by design or schedule but by some ancient calling, standing in drives while young ones mark the concrete with chalk colors or chase kites against the dying light. Like some forgotten time. Like the world hadnt gone mad with its screens and its wires.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the blue sky where clouds move like white buffalo across the plains. But the sky carries darkness too. Last night the sirens wailed their terrible song and we knew what was coming. The sound like some biblical horn calling judgment. I took my little dog and my purse and some pillows into the bathtub while the big dog, wild with fear, paced and barked in the living room like he could ward off what was coming.\n\nThe hail came. Hard pellets of ice striking the earth like shot, the neighborhood gone quiet save for this percussion from above. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cool, temperature falling seventeen degrees in minutes that felt like seconds. The sun broke through and rain fell still and a double rainbow appeared like God's own signature across the sky. I photographed it quick, shared it with people I knew who lived in screens.\n\nThe houses stand identical but inside theyre different as fingerprints. Some small as shoeboxes though you wouldnt know it. Behind my place theres a pond not for swimming and a field where deer ghost through the morning fog. Bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns at dawn while roosters crow from farms unseen, and sometimes in the evening a donkey brays his lonely song like some testament to solitude. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be forty years from anywhere. A village unto itself. I found it like you might find an arrowhead in fresh turned soil, this place, this neighborhood, this home.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Memory holds like a fist round the throat. The move from Riverdale to Stockbridge came with tears salt and bitter, the kind that burn tracks down young cheeks in the dark. Mother and father spoke of better things. Better schools. Better houses. Places where the streets dont carry the weight of what they called ghetto. As if words could wash clean what was already written.\n\nTime passed like wind through dead grass. Friends came. Enemies too. The neighbors kept to themselves save for Mr Glen and Dennis whose houses pressed against ours like books on a shelf. Mr Glen got himself married again and we went to the wedding, my sister and parents and me watching this new beginning like witnesses to some ancient rite. Ms Veda in white, her garter sailing through air thick with hope and landing in my hands while the flowers found another's grasp. We danced. All of us. Marsharii, Glen's daughter, moved like smoke in lamplight. Never saw her after. The world takes what it wants.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads like a wound, streets tangled as veins. GPS helps now but before it was all wandering. Me and Kason and Curtis spent days in digital worlds, controllers warm in our hands like prayer beads. Sometimes the park calls with its green silence. I go there with sticks from the hardware store, practice balance like some warrior monk. The wooden sword, the bokken, makes music in the air. Basketball courts and tennis courts wait empty as church pews. Memory again: Dad and Mr Graves teaching tennis, the sun watching like an old god while we learned the religion of the serve and volley.\n\nTheres more. Always more. Stories pile like autumn leaves but these stick harder than most. What comes next waits in the dark like all futures do. Patient. Hungry.",
            "The town lay there like something forgotten by God. Not special among the countless other specks that dotted South Carolina save for what grew from its soil. Johnston. The Peach Capital of the World, or so proclaimed the weathered sign that greeted wayfarers, its paint peeling like dead skin in the merciless southern sun.\n\nFields stretched out beyond sight, an endless sea of peach trees or cattle, depending on which way you turned your head. Houses stood apart from one another like estranged kin, most two stories tall with metal roofs that reflected the savage summer heat or gray shingles dark as storm clouds. They squatted far back from the road, letting their front acres birth crops or sustain beasts that moved like shadows across the land.\n\nThe town proper centered around a single stoplight that swayed like a hanged man above a four-way crossing. Here stood the meager offerings of commerce: Hong Kong, where a single family cooked behind steamed windows; Fiesta Mexican, its neon sign flickering in the dusk; and Gary's, where burgers were served with a side of small-town desperation. The pizzeria was gone now, its windows dark as cave mouths.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug endured, known more for its Cherry Coca-Cola than any medicine it dispensed. The IGA grocery stood like a fortress of overpriced necessities, though most folks made the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, as if seeking salvation in better prices. Dollar General thrived like a weed in rich soil, its parking lot never empty from dawn till dusk.\n\nThe furniture store, Possibilities, run by a woman whose kindness seemed anachronistic in these times, shared walls with Clark's Cuts and Kennels where dogs went in dirty and came out clean. A doctor and a vet practiced their trades on the outskirts, tending to the living things that still remained.\n\nChildren learned their letters at Johnston Elementary until fifth grade sent them away to the next town over, like young birds pushed from the nest. No parks existed yet, though men spoke of one coming, 2.5 acres of promised land for families to gather and visitors to admire. No picture shows, no bowling alleys, no place for youth to congregate except empty parking lots and abandoned fields. Just a town you could miss between heartbeats, there and gone like a dream you can't quite remember come morning.",
            "We live here where the asphalt runs between two highways, a tributary of progress cutting through what was once ancient wood. The traffic passes like blood through veins. Constant. Relentless. The houses stand like sentinels, their occupants as permanent as the seasons, their faces known to me as my own. They tend their rectangular plots of earth like penitents, mowing and raking and burning in cyclical devotion to some suburban god.\n\nThe house sits at the corner where the road bends, watching. Always watching. Four souls dwell within its walls. Me. The wife. Two daughters with ages hanging off them like price tags in a time-worn shop. Eleven. Fourteen. Numbers that mean everything and nothing.\n\nIn winter the children drag their plastic sleds up the hill on the side street, their breath hanging in clouds above them like steam from locomotives long dead. We know every vehicle that passes, their shapes and sounds as familiar as scripture. The strange ones stand out like wolves among sheep.\n\nThe walkers come and go, leading their dogs on strings of leather and nylon. Children pedal their mechanical steeds through the gathering dusk. We work from home, our presence as constant as the sun. Sometimes we stand in the rain like wild things, letting the water wash away the domesticity that clings to us like moss.\n\nSmoke rises from the grill out back, meat offerings to the sky. The sound of mowers echoes from March through October like mechanical locusts, the grass growing and dying in its appointed time. The trees stand ancient and tall, their leaves a constant reminder of what this place used to be. Come autumn they shed their burden and we burn them, the smoke carrying memories of forests long forgotten.\n\nWinter comes seldom now, as if the season itself has lost its way. The garage stands behind like a concrete cave, its doors opening to the neighborhood like eyes. I work there on my truck, steel and grease becoming meditation. The holidays bring strangers' cars, clustered like fallen leaves in driveways and along curbs, their owners gathering inside homes like moths to flame.\n\nThis is where we are. This is what we've become. The road runs through like a river of tar, carrying pieces of the world past our door. If it were not for this current of steel and rubber, this place might be perfect. But perfection died with the trees that once stood here, and we are left with what remains.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast and ancient thing, all dirt and dust and more dirt still, a brown expanse that knows no end. Those who aint lived here cant know it, cant understand what it means to see nothing but brown forever and when you do spy a patch of green lawn you know that man has paid dearly for his small victory over nature. Back in the nineties the houses stood alone like sentinels in the waste but now they've multiplied like some concrete plague though the spaces between them still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like a living thing, consuming the desert day by day though I reckon thats the way of all places now. Good folk mostly, though like anywhere the darkness in men's hearts can poison a place. My patch is ringed with the old ones, quiet folk who mind their business and tend their days. The stores are all chains, soulless boxes with names like Food For Less and Smart and Final, and if you want something fine you got to drive and drive far. No Whole Foods here. No sir.\n\nConstruction rules this land. Men with hammers and nails building dreams in the dust, filling the empty spaces with wood and metal and hope. Sometimes I look out and see the vacant lots diminishing and it puts a fear in me. I fled the big city and dont aim to live in one again. I know construction. Its my trade. Drywall and ceiling grids, marking the boundaries between inside and out.\n\nThe animals here, they got their own order. Folk come to the high desert for many reasons but chief among them is the stark and terrible beauty of it all. The land shapes what lives here, cruel and unforgiving, creating creatures that survive despite all odds. We who choose to live here must learn their ways or perish. My young ones, they've taken to it like they was born to it. Three of them out there now hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen.\n\nThe county fair comes once a year, bringing noise and light to the quiet places. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like some white judgment, and folks learn to slide down it for sport. Down at the Victor Valley Museum they keep the bones and artifacts, pieces of the past locked behind glass, telling stories of the people who tried to tame this land before us. But the desert, it just keeps on being what it is, unchanging and eternal, watching us come and go like dust in the wind.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete desert, buildings rising up from the earth like worn monoliths. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of, with white picket fences and children's bicycles laid against garage doors. No. This here's my home all the same, dormitory walls containing multitudes, souls stacked one atop another in this strange vertical community.\n\nThe buildings stand sentinel. Three kinds there are, each serving its purpose in this concrete congregation. First come the apartments, squared off and efficient, holding twenty souls or thereabouts, stacked two floors high like some modern pueblo dwelling. Then there's the proper houses, scattered rare as gold teeth, where them that's affiliated with the school might lay their heads. Alumni mostly, living in these relics of conventional dwelling. Last and most numerous are the dormitories themselves, great rectangular hives where hundreds sleep and dream and study, two to a cell like some voluntary prison of learning.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds moving through the spaces between buildings like blood through veins. The old ones, the professors and such, they claim them scattered houses while young blood fills the dorms and apartments according to their station, like some unspoken caste system that everyone understands but nobody mentions.\n\nAnd commerce thrives here too, stores dealing in sustenance and school pride, feeding and clothing this strange tribe. There's a park too, though calling it such seems wrong somehow - more like a shared space where all these disparate souls come together under the same sky, keeping it clean and safe like some communal obligation to decency.\n\nThis aint no regular neighborhood but it serves the same purpose as any other. A place where people live and die and try to make sense of their small piece of the world. And maybe that's all any neighborhood really is, when you strip away the pretense and convention.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set his hand against it, and the house stands sentinel at the peak of the steepest grade. They call it the workout hill. Runners come and go like penitents climbing to salvation. The street bare and broken, pocked with time and weather. Above, the electric lines hang like old rope, spliced and mended where storm and branch have had their way with them. Repairs upon repairs. The evergreens stand dark against the sky but folk here despise them, cut them down with a fury born of blocked views, as if the trees themselves conspired against their dominion over the sea-sight.\n\nThe houses rise like glass temples to the water below, stacked one above the other in their reaching. At sunset the bay burns copper and gold but most days the light filters gray through the constant veil of clouds that hang like funeral shrouds over the land. The damp brings moss, green and ancient, claiming every surface left untended. Cars, roofs, railings all submit to its quiet conquest.\n\nNo children here. The old ones have claimed this ground, the retired and the waiting. Dogs rule these streets now, running wild and free, crossing boundaries at will. They enter homes unbidden, like thieves testing doors. Found one once in the parlor, standing there like it owned the place. The rabbits too have their dominion, great beasts that war with the gardeners for control of the earth itself. The cats hunt them with ancient instinct, keeping their numbers in check. Birds wheel overhead - sparrow, hummingbird, hawk and eagle all - until the crows, black-winged arbiters of the sky, drive them hence.\n\nDown the hill where land meets water stand the restaurants, serving up the ocean's bounty. No proper beach exists, just rocks dark with spray that wait to be cast into the waters. The bay stretches narrow, the far shore a constant presence through the mist like some half-remembered dream.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some concrete testament to the city's endless hunger, stretching out beneath a gray sky that hung low and heavy as a shroud. You could find it easy enough. The trains came and went like iron serpents through the borough's veins, carrying the masses in their steel bellies.\n\nThe streets told stories of change. Where once Italian voices echoed off brick walls now came the sound of Asian tongues, strange and melodic in the morning air. Every block bore witness to this transformation, storefronts with characters etched in scripts ancient as civilization itself. Markets sprouted like weeds through concrete, four within spitting distance of each other, their shelves heavy with goods from across the Pacific. The people came and they built and they stayed.\n\nA park stood renovated, new as sin. Basketball courts stretched out like dominoes, ten of them, and beyond lay fields where children played at games older than memory. Water sprayed from fountains in summer, baptizing the young who shrieked and ran through the mist. All colors of humanity gathered there, as if the world had been poured into one vessel and left to settle.\n\nThe buildings squatted low, mostly two-family affairs, no corporate towers reaching for god here. Music blasted from cars day and night, engines roaring like wounded beasts, their drivers pressing pedals to metal as if pursued by demons unseen. The night brought its own terrors. Though safety wrapped the neighborhood like a thin blanket, violence lurked in shadows, waiting patient as a spider. Thieves prowled for packages left like offerings on doorsteps, and bullies stalked the streets seeking quarrel without cause.\n\nDog waste dotted the sidewalks like landmines, ignored by their keepers despite the city's proclamations against such things. Signs posted meant nothing to those who viewed rules as suggestions meant for others. The morning light revealed these deposits like bitter testimonies to man's indifference, waiting for the unwary shoe to discover their presence.",
            "First thing about Portland Oregon is what they mean by weird. Word's painted up on some building downtown, serving pizza and spirits and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws they dont even know exist yet. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk remember when weird meant something else, back in the nineties when the streets were emptier and rent was cheap and art grew wild in the cracks like weeds. Others hear it like a siren song calling them home at last.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their steel and glass boxes reaching up into the grey sky but the weird abides. Not the kind of weird that opens its arms to everything but the kind that shelters what other places cast out. We got our Walmart same as anywhere. Got our Amazon boxes piled on porches. But theres something else too.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand like desert flowers painted colors that dont exist in nature. Gardens grow thick and wild right up to the sidewalk, herbs and tomatoes free for the taking. And the free boxes. Lord the free boxes. Cardboard testimonies to what people leave behind, little altars of abandonment that sometimes hold treasure for them that look. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes things you cant name, things that might be exactly what you needed without knowing you needed it.\n\nSome folks here do their yoga with goats. Real goats walking around on their backs while they stretch out like lizards in the sun. Some paint their faces and scream at soccer matches like its the end times. Some just drink. The rain comes down most days, gray and eternal as god's own tears, and it gets in your head after a while. Makes people strange. Makes em sick sometimes.\n\nGot our share of lost souls too, sleeping in doorways and under bridges. City tries to help but helping aint ever enough. Rest of us watch em, sometimes with pity sometimes with rage, same as anywhere else. In that way we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stand in the north like ancient gods. Watching. Always watching. The mountains bear witness to each dawn and dusk as the sun makes its weary pilgrimage across the heavens, indifferent to the struggles of men below. A man forgets them sometimes. Gets caught in the machinations of his daily bread. But they remain. Unchanging. Unmoved. When the spirit grows weak and the mind turns to rust they command attention with their stark permanence, offering what solace stone can give to flesh.\n\nI came here young. A student. The university stretched below them mountains like some grand experiment in civilization, all brick and mortar and manufactured pools where turtles and waterfowl went about their primitive rituals. Downtown the old buildings wore their faded colors like badges of former glory. Coffee houses full of young scholars burning midnight oil, their faces lit by screens in the dark. The streets there pulse with an energy that mocks the quiet suburbs beyond, where the library stands sentinel between two worlds.\n\nThis town holds memories like a collector holds artifacts. Some precious. Some better left buried. Nights spent with companions on rusted playground swings. Racing through streets toward picture shows in that gaudy theater where students went free. But there were darker times too. Times when a man might find himself at the edge of them ponds in the dark hours, questioning his place in the order of things while ducks slept on black water.\n\nOne such morning I walked. Past houses neat as tombs. Past empty parks. The sun coming up like a copper coin through them palm trees, painting the sky colors that aint got proper names. My feet carried me north without thinking, like they knew some truth my mind had forgot. And there they stood. Them mountains cutting into the dawn sky like they was put there by whatever hand first shaped this world. They spoke without speaking. Said what they always said. About enduring. About going on. And that was enough.",
            "You'd pass it by and think nothing of it. Nothing there worth seeing. Residential block behind some shops like ten thousand others in ten thousand towns. But beyond where the old Whole Foods stands empty and past them hotels that fill only when summer brings the reunions of kin long scattered, there's life. Real life. Moving and breathing like something alive ought to.\n\nThe apartments rise like ancient things. Like clay figures some god done lined up and forgot. First ones got darkness in em. Evil maybe. Papers tell stories bout whats happened there but evil aint always where you think it lives. Next ones different though. Three blocks of em standing quiet and unknown to most folks round here. Watching.\n\nCross the way theres this college. Small thing. Branch of something bigger somewhere else. Students drift in through gates that cry out in rust and iron voices while the morning traffic builds up behind em like water behind a dam. Cars honking. People cursing. Sun climbing.\n\nRoad ends at another. T-shaped like a crucified thing. Park on one side. Medical place on the other where they fix broken bodies. Got chairs out front where nobody sits cept the air moving through the fan blades above. Park's got kids in it most days. Running like wild things through grass sharp as needles. Bees moving drunk through flowers by the road. Old folks walking dogs, giving mean looks to boys on boards with wheels, nodding to girls who cluster like birds and talk about nothing that'll matter come winter.\n\nStrip mall squats nearby. Sushi place. Pool store. Women painting nails. All of it together like it grew that way natural. Frozen yogurt too, where them kids go after they done trying to break their bones on concrete. They stand there breathing sweet poison from metal tubes thinking they invented rebellion.\n\nAll of it there like some picture of what America supposed to be. Time dont touch it much. South moving slow like molasses, holding onto what it knows, keeping what it's got. Same as it ever was. Same as it'll be.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames, bearing witness to times past and times passing. A small yard stretches before mine, driveway running alongside like a pale scar in the earth. These dwellings, all of them, they speak of dreams that once coursed through the veins of the nation like fever. Dreams that now recede like shadows at dawn, yet leave their mark upon the land and those who dwell here.\n\nThe people tend their patches of earth with less vigor now, their hopes dimmed but not extinguished. Automobiles rest in driveways like sleeping beasts. Children play in the streets, their world bounded by the horizon of their understanding, their games ancient as time itself. The schoolhouse stands, ninety years of brick and mortar and memory, drawing youth forward while pulling at the threads of remembrance in the old. Churches stand empty as bleached bones while the basketball courts pulse with life and motion.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years, the same burden of story. Super A stands sentinel at the corner, run by Yemeni folk, Arab blood in a sea of black faces. Wide streets stretch like rivers between the homes, young boys playing at their football till cars pass like great metal fish through their games. Generations deep the people here, their stories flowing like water through time, telling of days when neighbor knew neighbor and all was known.\n\nWhere once stood the karate school now stands the pharmacy, testament to how dreams change shape, how chemical comfort replaced the warrior's way. The movie house endures, showing ghosts of celluloid past at prices that dont pain the pocket, shunned by the young who chase newer phantoms but embraced by the old who remember when stories moved slower through the world.\n\nThe expressway passes like a great metal serpent, but touches not this ground. The old ones saw to that, wisdom or fear guiding their hands when they turned away the promise of progress. New school rising from the earth now, while they debate what manner of creature shall represent them. Some speak of metal men with country ways and log cabin dreams, as if such things could capture the truth of this place where past and present dance their eternal dance.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, its streets a tangled mass of concrete and steel where dwellings and commerce bleed into one another without rhythm or reason. Here stand the edifices of trade, glass-fronted and cold, there the eateries and shops strung like beads on an endless thread. The corporations have their temples here, great branded fortresses, but so too do the small merchants ply their trade in dim storefronts, their windows dusty with hope.\n\nThe parks persist like green wounds in the gray flesh of streets. Children come here. Their mothers watch. All around the streets pulse with the blood of many nations. The queers have carved their territory here, as have the Jews in their black coats and hats, and the scattered remnants of the fallen Soviet empire. Beyond lie the other tribes in their own marked territories. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. All pressed together yet separate, like oil floating on water.\n\nTen miles might as well be a hundred. The cars move like dying things through the arteries of the city, sometimes taking hours to crawl what a man could walk in thirty minutes. But none walk here. The city's vastness forbids it. The machines rule these roads and the people sit captive in their metal boxes, searching endlessly for some small square of earth to abandon their vehicles upon.\n\nThey build upward now, great towers of glass and concrete rising like concrete stalagmites from the earth. The people come and still they come, and those already here watch with dead eyes as the streets grow fuller, the air thicker, the spaces between things smaller.\n\nHouses stand in their various forms. Some squat alone on their plots while others are stacked like children's blocks, divided into cells where families make their lives. The people who dwell in them are strangers to one another, passing like ghosts, nodding without seeing. Time was when children played in these streets, when neighbors knew neighbors. But that time has passed into memory, as thin and fragile as smoke in the wind.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stretched out beyond sight like a yellow sea frozen in time. This is what there is, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before. Coming from streets where grocers stood shoulder to shoulder with barbershops and laundromats, this emptiness was foreign to her. Strange. I told her tales of my youth in these Ohio fields and she listened quiet-like, understanding finally the place that shaped me.\n\nPast endless rows of corn a water-filled quarry appears like some ancient wound in the earth. Beyond it lies the place I call home. Houses of brick and stucco stand sentinel over half-acre plots, each yard maintained with religious devotion. Spring brings forth flowers planted by careful hands while the trees mark time's passing with their changing colors. Mercedes automobiles line driveways like chrome sentinels, their surfaces catching sunlight like mirrors after washing.\n\nThe Korean man tends his grass daily, singing songs from his homeland over the mechanical drone of his mower. Once a healer of men, now he tends to simpler things. Age has taken its toll but left his genuine nature intact. He moves across his lawn like a ghost, one with his machine.\n\nMy house stands grey against the sky. Geese patrol the side yard while our small terrier gives chase, both locked in some eternal dance. A stream whispers past, feeding the quarry's waters. Bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns while cattle low in distant fields. Cross the wooden bridge I built with my own hands and you'll find yourself in a wilderness untouched by man's intentions. Trees and wildflowers grow as God intended.\n\nThis was my kingdom as a child. Built forts in those trees. Stalked imaginary prey through those woods. Other children would appear and disappear like phantoms, companions in our wild games.\n\nWinter comes harsh here. Beautiful and merciless both. The yard transforms into something ancient and empty. Trees that once bloomed now stand like condemned men waiting execution. Snow comes in the night like some divine blanket. My sister's snow angels appear like messages from heaven, while snowmen stand guard over our domain. We warred with snowballs, building fortresses from packed snow and fallen branches, arsenals for our childhood battles. In that frozen realm we played at life, ignorant of the world beyond our snow-fort walls, innocent of time's passing."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland meets them tourist towns like old friends meeting at a crossroads. Ain't no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores standing sentinel over parking lots vast as prairie. To get anywhere you got to drive and drive through land that God himself must've took extra care in making. Water everywhere. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them like great mirrors laid down by some forgotten race of giants.\n\nThe houses here dont march in rows like soldiers. They stand apart from one another like old men who've known each other too long to need to crowd. Some got new faces, some wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the earth like root cellars waiting for some apocalypse that aint come yet. The siding's mostly aluminum, weathered and wore. Colors everywhere. Like God spilled his paint box across these streets.\n\nYards stretch out wide enough for dreams to grow. Trampolines stand like black circles against the sky, swing sets rust in the Michigan air. Gardens grow where folks plant them, and fences hold whatever needs holding. These houses speak of work and time and children grown and children growing still.\n\nYou'll see them running these streets like wild things. Dogs and bikes and skaters passing like shadows. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. They wave from their grills, smoke rising like prayers into the evening air. They nod from their porches like judges on their benches.\n\nThe lawns stay neat cause that's the way of things here. No dead leaves sleeping past their time. No grass growing wild and wrong. Everything trimmed and proper like it ought to be. Ain't beautiful in the way that makes rich folks stop their cars and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes a man feel right about raising his children here.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, and the health department, and the place where they sort through what folks throw away. Baseball games echo through the streets, the names of children carried on the wind like birds. Planes come and go from the little airport, their engines growling at the sky. Ice cream waits downtown for them that want to walk for it. The park stands eight blocks distant, like some promised land for children on their bikes.\n\nThis here's a good place. A right place. The kind of place where the world makes sense, even when nothing else does.",
            "They built it like all the others. Row after row of houses stamped from the same mold, each yard a mirror of the next with its patch of grass and scattered stones and driveways that could scarce hold two cars lengthwise. The trees were young yet, planted at intervals decided by men who'd never live there, their branches reaching skyward like supplicants before a stern god.\n\nThe homeowners association ruled here with invisible hands. Their commandments writ in bylaws and covenants that shaped the very air folk breathed. Two-car garages stood sentinel, doors aligned like soldiers at attention. The roads were smooth as glass, unmarred by time or weather, as if decay itself had been legislated away.\n\nMailboxes gathered in clusters at the street ends, metal sentries requiring keys to yield their secrets. Package lockers stood larger among them, warehouse to the commerce of modern life. The neighborhood pressed against the city's edge where civilization met wilderness, though wilderness here meant planned pools behind iron gates and trails that wound through manufactured wilderness like asphalt snakes.\n\nThe people who dwelt here were mostly old, their working years behind them. They watched from windows and porches, guardians of a peace they'd bought with retirement checks and social security. Mixed among them were the younger ones, professionals with briefcases and smart phones who'd sought refuge in this ordered world.\n\nThe city beyond sprawled vast yet maintained pretenses of small-town life, like a wolf in sheep's wool. One mall stood testament to commerce, neither grand nor humble, serving its purpose like a dutiful servant. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction led to the familiar totems of American life - grocery stores selling organic salvation at premium prices, discount temples with skeleton crews trading low prices for fluorescent sterility.\n\nIt was a place carved from chaos into order, maintained by rules and money and the fear of disorder. Safe as a vault, clean as a hospital, predictable as sunrise. A place where people could walk their dogs or themselves and never fear getting lost, where every need was met so long as you could drive fifteen minutes to meet it.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through digital ether like phantom radio. Strange thing to hear. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more per moon and none Id known had heard such tales. Maybe its the weight of living crushing down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper, friends trying to hold together against the dark. Everything costs dear now but we learned to stretch what little we got. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, musty toys and clothes sealed away in time. Your nose forgets what it once knew. Some take to tobacco, others just stop noticing. But the fleamarket smell it dont ever leave you be. Adulthood smells like yellowed paper stacked on dead pianos, that smell that works its way into leather and wont wash out no matter what you do.\n\nThree stores selling old things within walking distance. Starting far out you can make your way through charity shops and libraries and places selling rare books and curious things. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but in them old stores time stands still. Silent as tombs no matter the chaos outside. Good place to lose yourself. More folks come each year, more machines too. They call it progress. Some big company dealing in bits and screens made its home here and the city aint settled into its new skin yet. Makes me think of New York. Everyone got their own purpose and dont nobody ask much of nobody else. You can wrap yourself in silence and solitude and aint nobody gonna try tear that away. Not like down South where concern means care. Here you keep to yourself and the city rolls past like waves on sand.\n\nLife goes on though. Got a piano player next door and two who fancy themselves singers up above. Less strangers more like family now. We come together when needs must, mark births and deaths and help each other through the dark times. Lucky maybe. My neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. We pass mail back and forth like old friends. Good to see them, good to be seen. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make me think I aint wasted my life after all.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something less defined. Our quarter sits on the eastern edge where the houses stand weathered and dim like tired sentinels. Here the people make do with less. They rent mostly. Some own. All of them carrying the weight of thin wallets and thinner prospects.\n\nThe streets aint hostile though. Folk nod and speak when you pass. They carry their poverty like old clothes, worn but dignified. Violence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome relative that wont stay gone. Shots ring out in the night. Bodies fall. The neighbors boy went down outside a bar last year, his blood soaking into earth that holds no memory of such things. We lost nothing save what thieves took from the porch, small items left too long in the open air.\n\nThe poison that runs through the veins of America runs here too. Fentanyl. A devil's bargain paid in dead sons and daughters. The town tries to fight it with clinics and training, teaching people how to bring back the nearly dead. Some come back. Some dont.\n\nYet there's grace here too. The schoolhouse where my boy goes stands like a sanctuary. The teachers there, they dont see his difference as something broken. They work with a kind of fierce gentleness. No child goes hungry there. They feed them all the same, rich or poor, no matter. The families come together, plan things, make it better than it has to be.\n\nThe town council, they try. New roads get laid. Parks bloom where wreckage stood. But their attention drifts west like the setting sun, toward the shopping strips and the money. Our side stays forgotten, like an old photograph nobody looks at anymore.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint much but it holds us. Keeps the rain out. Keeps us together. Sometimes I think about leaving but the thought feels wrong, like trying to wear someone else's skin. This place, broken as it is, it's home. And home aint perfect but it's where you know the broken places by heart and love them anyway.",
            "The neighborhood stands upon the hill like some ancient altar, its weathered buildings bearing witness to histories untold. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater looms dark and quiet, its marquee dead in the day. Down The Hill there's a place where games sing their electric songs and people gather like moths to flame in the summer dark, queued in long serpentine lines that wind through the streets of June and July.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast and empty save for the concrete that circles it like a grey noose, steps carved into its face like ancient hieroglyphs. Winter brings the dispossessed, their nylon shelters arrayed in geometric precision along the walks and stairs, huddled against the rain that falls eternal and cold. No snow comes but the water falls merciless and without cease, driving them together like cattle in a storm. They cluster near the family center where steam rises from showers and sinks, their only refuge in miles of urban wilderness.\n\nBut it aint the proud buildings nor the hills that roll like waves toward the far Pacific that make this place. It's the people carrying their histories like old wounds. Hilltop they call it, where once blood ran in gutters and gangs ruled like medieval lords. Federal men came through like locusts, badges glinting, sweeping clean what could not be cleaned. The stories persist, passed down like dark gospels, father to son, mother to daughter, and to newcomers like myself who listen in the shadows.\n\nThe people here bear their burden proud, though outsiders still whisper warnings about white folk walking these streets after dark. But such words carry the stink of old fears and older hatreds. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass, or maybe these streets know their own. They know who sees the truth of this nation's sins, the racism and fear that prowl like hungry dogs even in this supposed paradise of cultures.\n\nThese streets are home now. I've walked them in darkness and found not threat but sanctuary. Seen strangers offer warmth instead of violence. Watched laundry workers extend mercy in small measures of time and electricity. Felt the concrete against my back on grey nights when the world seemed empty, only to find some angel of the streets pressing crumpled dollars in my palm, speaking beauty into existence like some urban prophet.\n\nThis is Hilltop. These are my people now.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade commenced, the houses standing like silent sentinels in the August heat. Making friends dont come easy to a boy in a strange place but there was two of them lived nearby, one two doors down and another somewhere along the dusty street though neither walks these roads no more. The old guard remains mostly, their faces weathered like the vinyl siding that adorns these two-story dwellings that could be anywhere in America.\n\nThe children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off empty porches where packages sit unmolested like offerings to some suburban god. Trust here is a currency spent careful and rare but somehow it endures. The neighbors keep to themselves save when help is needed, like some unspoken covenant carved in sidewalk chalk.\n\nThere's a park not far, maybe two minutes walking. Basketball hoops stand like gallows in the fading light, bearing witness to countless games played out on cracked concrete. Football too, and baseball, though one day the park took its toll when an elbow found my nose in a spray of crimson. But good memories outweigh the bad like gold outweighs lead. Now I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them climb and swing like monkeys in a concrete jungle, their joy pure and unfiltered as spring water.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though most folks now summon their meals through glowing screens and wait for strangers to bring sustenance to their doors. Fast food joints squat on corners like toads, identical to their brothers in every other suburb across this vast land. Pizza places too, more than any man could count.\n\nThe stores stand shoulder to shoulder offering their wares - dry cleaners with their chemical smell, the twin pharmacies facing each other like duelists, the Jewel-Osco where the Midwest does its marketing. There's even an Indian store that smells of cardamom and cumin and holds secrets in glass jars.\n\nI've grown fond of this place. The horror stories that float across screens and airwaves of neighbor turned against neighbor make me grateful for this peace, this quiet understanding we've built here. This is my home now, for better or worse, and I reckon that's something worth holding onto.",
            "The college stands near where I live and that's good enough. Concrete rises up in blocks and squares, apartments stacked like ancient pueblos but with neon signs for bars hanging off their faces. One bar changed its name. More expensive now but the liquor still burns the same. The people here exist in two tribes: students with their backpacks and textbooks, and the poor folk who've found refuge in these cheap walls. Children too, their voices echoing off brick and mortar near the schoolyard.\n\nMy neighbors I don't know and don't care to know. The sweet sick smell of their smoking seeps through walls and the management's mounted some plastic contraption that spits artificial pine into the hallway like some kind of joke against nature. The buildings stand tired, weathered, their insides gutted and remade but their faces still showing age like old men. Down the road they've built new ones, all glass and promise, but the walls are thin as paper and the rent is highway robbery. They know the students will come anyway.\n\nThere's a place serves food on paper plates, everything heated in the microwave's blue glow. Gas station across the way. Bad place to work they say. City money came through last summer, laid down concrete in wide strips, planted grass in neat rows like a cemetery. Trees shadow my building, some cut down to stumps like broken teeth, but more still standing than down the road. Behind us lies another street, 43rd, meaner and darker than ours. Concrete broken and heaved up like earth after a quake. Buildings there wear their decay like badges. Crime flows through there like water in a wash, but it spills over here too sometimes, touching everything.\n\nBut I stay. The rent doesn't break me and I can walk to class through the trees. Buses come and go like mechanical mules, carrying people to stores and downtown, all of us moving through this concrete maze we've built, all of us pretending we're going somewhere better.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end street, white porches gleaming under metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses. Regular houses where regular folk lived and breathed and died. Most evenings we gather, not by design or schedule but by some ancient calling, standing in drives while young ones mark the concrete with chalk colors or chase kites against the dying light. Like some forgotten time. Like the world hadnt gone mad with its screens and its wires.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the blue sky where clouds move like white buffalo across the plains. But the sky carries darkness too. Last night the sirens wailed their terrible song and we knew what was coming. The sound like some biblical horn calling judgment. I took my little dog and my purse and some pillows into the bathtub while the big dog, wild with fear, paced and barked in the living room like he could ward off what was coming.\n\nThe hail came. Hard pellets of ice striking the earth like shot, the neighborhood gone quiet save for this percussion from above. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cool, temperature falling seventeen degrees in minutes that felt like seconds. The sun broke through and rain fell still and a double rainbow appeared like God's own signature across the sky. I photographed it quick, shared it with people I knew who lived in screens.\n\nThe houses stand identical but inside theyre different as fingerprints. Some small as shoeboxes though you wouldnt know it. Behind my place theres a pond not for swimming and a field where deer ghost through the morning fog. Bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns at dawn while roosters crow from farms unseen, and sometimes in the evening a donkey brays his lonely song like some testament to solitude. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be forty years from anywhere. A village unto itself. I found it like you might find an arrowhead in fresh turned soil, this place, this neighborhood, this home.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Memory holds like a fist round the throat. The move from Riverdale to Stockbridge came with tears salt and bitter, the kind that burn tracks down young cheeks in the dark. Mother and father spoke of better things. Better schools. Better houses. Places where the streets dont carry the weight of what they called ghetto. As if words could wash clean what was already written.\n\nTime passed like wind through dead grass. Friends came. Enemies too. The neighbors kept to themselves save for Mr Glen and Dennis whose houses pressed against ours like books on a shelf. Mr Glen got himself married again and we went to the wedding, my sister and parents and me watching this new beginning like witnesses to some ancient rite. Ms Veda in white, her garter sailing through air thick with hope and landing in my hands while the flowers found another's grasp. We danced. All of us. Marsharii, Glen's daughter, moved like smoke in lamplight. Never saw her after. The world takes what it wants.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads like a wound, streets tangled as veins. GPS helps now but before it was all wandering. Me and Kason and Curtis spent days in digital worlds, controllers warm in our hands like prayer beads. Sometimes the park calls with its green silence. I go there with sticks from the hardware store, practice balance like some warrior monk. The wooden sword, the bokken, makes music in the air. Basketball courts and tennis courts wait empty as church pews. Memory again: Dad and Mr Graves teaching tennis, the sun watching like an old god while we learned the religion of the serve and volley.\n\nTheres more. Always more. Stories pile like autumn leaves but these stick harder than most. What comes next waits in the dark like all futures do. Patient. Hungry.",
            "The town lay there like something forgotten by God. Not special among the countless other specks that dotted South Carolina save for what grew from its soil. Johnston. The Peach Capital of the World, or so proclaimed the weathered sign that greeted wayfarers, its paint peeling like dead skin in the merciless southern sun.\n\nFields stretched out beyond sight, an endless sea of peach trees or cattle, depending on which way you turned your head. Houses stood apart from one another like estranged kin, most two stories tall with metal roofs that reflected the savage summer heat or gray shingles dark as storm clouds. They squatted far back from the road, letting their front acres birth crops or sustain beasts that moved like shadows across the land.\n\nThe town proper centered around a single stoplight that swayed like a hanged man above a four-way crossing. Here stood the meager offerings of commerce: Hong Kong, where a single family cooked behind steamed windows; Fiesta Mexican, its neon sign flickering in the dusk; and Gary's, where burgers were served with a side of small-town desperation. The pizzeria was gone now, its windows dark as cave mouths.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug endured, known more for its Cherry Coca-Cola than any medicine it dispensed. The IGA grocery stood like a fortress of overpriced necessities, though most folks made the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, as if seeking salvation in better prices. Dollar General thrived like a weed in rich soil, its parking lot never empty from dawn till dusk.\n\nThe furniture store, Possibilities, run by a woman whose kindness seemed anachronistic in these times, shared walls with Clark's Cuts and Kennels where dogs went in dirty and came out clean. A doctor and a vet practiced their trades on the outskirts, tending to the living things that still remained.\n\nChildren learned their letters at Johnston Elementary until fifth grade sent them away to the next town over, like young birds pushed from the nest. No parks existed yet, though men spoke of one coming, 2.5 acres of promised land for families to gather and visitors to admire. No picture shows, no bowling alleys, no place for youth to congregate except empty parking lots and abandoned fields. Just a town you could miss between heartbeats, there and gone like a dream you can't quite remember come morning.",
            "We live here where the asphalt runs between two highways, a tributary of progress cutting through what was once ancient wood. The traffic passes like blood through veins. Constant. Relentless. The houses stand like sentinels, their occupants as permanent as the seasons, their faces known to me as my own. They tend their rectangular plots of earth like penitents, mowing and raking and burning in cyclical devotion to some suburban god.\n\nThe house sits at the corner where the road bends, watching. Always watching. Four souls dwell within its walls. Me. The wife. Two daughters with ages hanging off them like price tags in a time-worn shop. Eleven. Fourteen. Numbers that mean everything and nothing.\n\nIn winter the children drag their plastic sleds up the hill on the side street, their breath hanging in clouds above them like steam from locomotives long dead. We know every vehicle that passes, their shapes and sounds as familiar as scripture. The strange ones stand out like wolves among sheep.\n\nThe walkers come and go, leading their dogs on strings of leather and nylon. Children pedal their mechanical steeds through the gathering dusk. We work from home, our presence as constant as the sun. Sometimes we stand in the rain like wild things, letting the water wash away the domesticity that clings to us like moss.\n\nSmoke rises from the grill out back, meat offerings to the sky. The sound of mowers echoes from March through October like mechanical locusts, the grass growing and dying in its appointed time. The trees stand ancient and tall, their leaves a constant reminder of what this place used to be. Come autumn they shed their burden and we burn them, the smoke carrying memories of forests long forgotten.\n\nWinter comes seldom now, as if the season itself has lost its way. The garage stands behind like a concrete cave, its doors opening to the neighborhood like eyes. I work there on my truck, steel and grease becoming meditation. The holidays bring strangers' cars, clustered like fallen leaves in driveways and along curbs, their owners gathering inside homes like moths to flame.\n\nThis is where we are. This is what we've become. The road runs through like a river of tar, carrying pieces of the world past our door. If it were not for this current of steel and rubber, this place might be perfect. But perfection died with the trees that once stood here, and we are left with what remains.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast and ancient thing, all dirt and dust and more dirt still, a brown expanse that knows no end. Those who aint lived here cant know it, cant understand what it means to see nothing but brown forever and when you do spy a patch of green lawn you know that man has paid dearly for his small victory over nature. Back in the nineties the houses stood alone like sentinels in the waste but now they've multiplied like some concrete plague though the spaces between them still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like a living thing, consuming the desert day by day though I reckon thats the way of all places now. Good folk mostly, though like anywhere the darkness in men's hearts can poison a place. My patch is ringed with the old ones, quiet folk who mind their business and tend their days. The stores are all chains, soulless boxes with names like Food For Less and Smart and Final, and if you want something fine you got to drive and drive far. No Whole Foods here. No sir.\n\nConstruction rules this land. Men with hammers and nails building dreams in the dust, filling the empty spaces with wood and metal and hope. Sometimes I look out and see the vacant lots diminishing and it puts a fear in me. I fled the big city and dont aim to live in one again. I know construction. Its my trade. Drywall and ceiling grids, marking the boundaries between inside and out.\n\nThe animals here, they got their own order. Folk come to the high desert for many reasons but chief among them is the stark and terrible beauty of it all. The land shapes what lives here, cruel and unforgiving, creating creatures that survive despite all odds. We who choose to live here must learn their ways or perish. My young ones, they've taken to it like they was born to it. Three of them out there now hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen.\n\nThe county fair comes once a year, bringing noise and light to the quiet places. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like some white judgment, and folks learn to slide down it for sport. Down at the Victor Valley Museum they keep the bones and artifacts, pieces of the past locked behind glass, telling stories of the people who tried to tame this land before us. But the desert, it just keeps on being what it is, unchanging and eternal, watching us come and go like dust in the wind.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete desert, buildings rising up from the earth like worn monoliths. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of, with white picket fences and children's bicycles laid against garage doors. No. This here's my home all the same, dormitory walls containing multitudes, souls stacked one atop another in this strange vertical community.\n\nThe buildings stand sentinel. Three kinds there are, each serving its purpose in this concrete congregation. First come the apartments, squared off and efficient, holding twenty souls or thereabouts, stacked two floors high like some modern pueblo dwelling. Then there's the proper houses, scattered rare as gold teeth, where them that's affiliated with the school might lay their heads. Alumni mostly, living in these relics of conventional dwelling. Last and most numerous are the dormitories themselves, great rectangular hives where hundreds sleep and dream and study, two to a cell like some voluntary prison of learning.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds moving through the spaces between buildings like blood through veins. The old ones, the professors and such, they claim them scattered houses while young blood fills the dorms and apartments according to their station, like some unspoken caste system that everyone understands but nobody mentions.\n\nAnd commerce thrives here too, stores dealing in sustenance and school pride, feeding and clothing this strange tribe. There's a park too, though calling it such seems wrong somehow - more like a shared space where all these disparate souls come together under the same sky, keeping it clean and safe like some communal obligation to decency.\n\nThis aint no regular neighborhood but it serves the same purpose as any other. A place where people live and die and try to make sense of their small piece of the world. And maybe that's all any neighborhood really is, when you strip away the pretense and convention.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set his hand against it, and the house stands sentinel at the peak of the steepest grade. They call it the workout hill. Runners come and go like penitents climbing to salvation. The street bare and broken, pocked with time and weather. Above, the electric lines hang like old rope, spliced and mended where storm and branch have had their way with them. Repairs upon repairs. The evergreens stand dark against the sky but folk here despise them, cut them down with a fury born of blocked views, as if the trees themselves conspired against their dominion over the sea-sight.\n\nThe houses rise like glass temples to the water below, stacked one above the other in their reaching. At sunset the bay burns copper and gold but most days the light filters gray through the constant veil of clouds that hang like funeral shrouds over the land. The damp brings moss, green and ancient, claiming every surface left untended. Cars, roofs, railings all submit to its quiet conquest.\n\nNo children here. The old ones have claimed this ground, the retired and the waiting. Dogs rule these streets now, running wild and free, crossing boundaries at will. They enter homes unbidden, like thieves testing doors. Found one once in the parlor, standing there like it owned the place. The rabbits too have their dominion, great beasts that war with the gardeners for control of the earth itself. The cats hunt them with ancient instinct, keeping their numbers in check. Birds wheel overhead - sparrow, hummingbird, hawk and eagle all - until the crows, black-winged arbiters of the sky, drive them hence.\n\nDown the hill where land meets water stand the restaurants, serving up the ocean's bounty. No proper beach exists, just rocks dark with spray that wait to be cast into the waters. The bay stretches narrow, the far shore a constant presence through the mist like some half-remembered dream.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some concrete testament to the city's endless hunger, stretching out beneath a gray sky that hung low and heavy as a shroud. You could find it easy enough. The trains came and went like iron serpents through the borough's veins, carrying the masses in their steel bellies.\n\nThe streets told stories of change. Where once Italian voices echoed off brick walls now came the sound of Asian tongues, strange and melodic in the morning air. Every block bore witness to this transformation, storefronts with characters etched in scripts ancient as civilization itself. Markets sprouted like weeds through concrete, four within spitting distance of each other, their shelves heavy with goods from across the Pacific. The people came and they built and they stayed.\n\nA park stood renovated, new as sin. Basketball courts stretched out like dominoes, ten of them, and beyond lay fields where children played at games older than memory. Water sprayed from fountains in summer, baptizing the young who shrieked and ran through the mist. All colors of humanity gathered there, as if the world had been poured into one vessel and left to settle.\n\nThe buildings squatted low, mostly two-family affairs, no corporate towers reaching for god here. Music blasted from cars day and night, engines roaring like wounded beasts, their drivers pressing pedals to metal as if pursued by demons unseen. The night brought its own terrors. Though safety wrapped the neighborhood like a thin blanket, violence lurked in shadows, waiting patient as a spider. Thieves prowled for packages left like offerings on doorsteps, and bullies stalked the streets seeking quarrel without cause.\n\nDog waste dotted the sidewalks like landmines, ignored by their keepers despite the city's proclamations against such things. Signs posted meant nothing to those who viewed rules as suggestions meant for others. The morning light revealed these deposits like bitter testimonies to man's indifference, waiting for the unwary shoe to discover their presence.",
            "First thing about Portland Oregon is what they mean by weird. Word's painted up on some building downtown, serving pizza and spirits and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws they dont even know exist yet. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk remember when weird meant something else, back in the nineties when the streets were emptier and rent was cheap and art grew wild in the cracks like weeds. Others hear it like a siren song calling them home at last.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their steel and glass boxes reaching up into the grey sky but the weird abides. Not the kind of weird that opens its arms to everything but the kind that shelters what other places cast out. We got our Walmart same as anywhere. Got our Amazon boxes piled on porches. But theres something else too.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand like desert flowers painted colors that dont exist in nature. Gardens grow thick and wild right up to the sidewalk, herbs and tomatoes free for the taking. And the free boxes. Lord the free boxes. Cardboard testimonies to what people leave behind, little altars of abandonment that sometimes hold treasure for them that look. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes things you cant name, things that might be exactly what you needed without knowing you needed it.\n\nSome folks here do their yoga with goats. Real goats walking around on their backs while they stretch out like lizards in the sun. Some paint their faces and scream at soccer matches like its the end times. Some just drink. The rain comes down most days, gray and eternal as god's own tears, and it gets in your head after a while. Makes people strange. Makes em sick sometimes.\n\nGot our share of lost souls too, sleeping in doorways and under bridges. City tries to help but helping aint ever enough. Rest of us watch em, sometimes with pity sometimes with rage, same as anywhere else. In that way we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stand in the north like ancient gods. Watching. Always watching. The mountains bear witness to each dawn and dusk as the sun makes its weary pilgrimage across the heavens, indifferent to the struggles of men below. A man forgets them sometimes. Gets caught in the machinations of his daily bread. But they remain. Unchanging. Unmoved. When the spirit grows weak and the mind turns to rust they command attention with their stark permanence, offering what solace stone can give to flesh.\n\nI came here young. A student. The university stretched below them mountains like some grand experiment in civilization, all brick and mortar and manufactured pools where turtles and waterfowl went about their primitive rituals. Downtown the old buildings wore their faded colors like badges of former glory. Coffee houses full of young scholars burning midnight oil, their faces lit by screens in the dark. The streets there pulse with an energy that mocks the quiet suburbs beyond, where the library stands sentinel between two worlds.\n\nThis town holds memories like a collector holds artifacts. Some precious. Some better left buried. Nights spent with companions on rusted playground swings. Racing through streets toward picture shows in that gaudy theater where students went free. But there were darker times too. Times when a man might find himself at the edge of them ponds in the dark hours, questioning his place in the order of things while ducks slept on black water.\n\nOne such morning I walked. Past houses neat as tombs. Past empty parks. The sun coming up like a copper coin through them palm trees, painting the sky colors that aint got proper names. My feet carried me north without thinking, like they knew some truth my mind had forgot. And there they stood. Them mountains cutting into the dawn sky like they was put there by whatever hand first shaped this world. They spoke without speaking. Said what they always said. About enduring. About going on. And that was enough.",
            "You'd pass it by and think nothing of it. Nothing there worth seeing. Residential block behind some shops like ten thousand others in ten thousand towns. But beyond where the old Whole Foods stands empty and past them hotels that fill only when summer brings the reunions of kin long scattered, there's life. Real life. Moving and breathing like something alive ought to.\n\nThe apartments rise like ancient things. Like clay figures some god done lined up and forgot. First ones got darkness in em. Evil maybe. Papers tell stories bout whats happened there but evil aint always where you think it lives. Next ones different though. Three blocks of em standing quiet and unknown to most folks round here. Watching.\n\nCross the way theres this college. Small thing. Branch of something bigger somewhere else. Students drift in through gates that cry out in rust and iron voices while the morning traffic builds up behind em like water behind a dam. Cars honking. People cursing. Sun climbing.\n\nRoad ends at another. T-shaped like a crucified thing. Park on one side. Medical place on the other where they fix broken bodies. Got chairs out front where nobody sits cept the air moving through the fan blades above. Park's got kids in it most days. Running like wild things through grass sharp as needles. Bees moving drunk through flowers by the road. Old folks walking dogs, giving mean looks to boys on boards with wheels, nodding to girls who cluster like birds and talk about nothing that'll matter come winter.\n\nStrip mall squats nearby. Sushi place. Pool store. Women painting nails. All of it together like it grew that way natural. Frozen yogurt too, where them kids go after they done trying to break their bones on concrete. They stand there breathing sweet poison from metal tubes thinking they invented rebellion.\n\nAll of it there like some picture of what America supposed to be. Time dont touch it much. South moving slow like molasses, holding onto what it knows, keeping what it's got. Same as it ever was. Same as it'll be.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames, bearing witness to times past and times passing. A small yard stretches before mine, driveway running alongside like a pale scar in the earth. These dwellings, all of them, they speak of dreams that once coursed through the veins of the nation like fever. Dreams that now recede like shadows at dawn, yet leave their mark upon the land and those who dwell here.\n\nThe people tend their patches of earth with less vigor now, their hopes dimmed but not extinguished. Automobiles rest in driveways like sleeping beasts. Children play in the streets, their world bounded by the horizon of their understanding, their games ancient as time itself. The schoolhouse stands, ninety years of brick and mortar and memory, drawing youth forward while pulling at the threads of remembrance in the old. Churches stand empty as bleached bones while the basketball courts pulse with life and motion.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years, the same burden of story. Super A stands sentinel at the corner, run by Yemeni folk, Arab blood in a sea of black faces. Wide streets stretch like rivers between the homes, young boys playing at their football till cars pass like great metal fish through their games. Generations deep the people here, their stories flowing like water through time, telling of days when neighbor knew neighbor and all was known.\n\nWhere once stood the karate school now stands the pharmacy, testament to how dreams change shape, how chemical comfort replaced the warrior's way. The movie house endures, showing ghosts of celluloid past at prices that dont pain the pocket, shunned by the young who chase newer phantoms but embraced by the old who remember when stories moved slower through the world.\n\nThe expressway passes like a great metal serpent, but touches not this ground. The old ones saw to that, wisdom or fear guiding their hands when they turned away the promise of progress. New school rising from the earth now, while they debate what manner of creature shall represent them. Some speak of metal men with country ways and log cabin dreams, as if such things could capture the truth of this place where past and present dance their eternal dance.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, its streets a tangled mass of concrete and steel where dwellings and commerce bleed into one another without rhythm or reason. Here stand the edifices of trade, glass-fronted and cold, there the eateries and shops strung like beads on an endless thread. The corporations have their temples here, great branded fortresses, but so too do the small merchants ply their trade in dim storefronts, their windows dusty with hope.\n\nThe parks persist like green wounds in the gray flesh of streets. Children come here. Their mothers watch. All around the streets pulse with the blood of many nations. The queers have carved their territory here, as have the Jews in their black coats and hats, and the scattered remnants of the fallen Soviet empire. Beyond lie the other tribes in their own marked territories. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. All pressed together yet separate, like oil floating on water.\n\nTen miles might as well be a hundred. The cars move like dying things through the arteries of the city, sometimes taking hours to crawl what a man could walk in thirty minutes. But none walk here. The city's vastness forbids it. The machines rule these roads and the people sit captive in their metal boxes, searching endlessly for some small square of earth to abandon their vehicles upon.\n\nThey build upward now, great towers of glass and concrete rising like concrete stalagmites from the earth. The people come and still they come, and those already here watch with dead eyes as the streets grow fuller, the air thicker, the spaces between things smaller.\n\nHouses stand in their various forms. Some squat alone on their plots while others are stacked like children's blocks, divided into cells where families make their lives. The people who dwell in them are strangers to one another, passing like ghosts, nodding without seeing. Time was when children played in these streets, when neighbors knew neighbors. But that time has passed into memory, as thin and fragile as smoke in the wind.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stretched out beyond sight like a yellow sea frozen in time. This is what there is, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before. Coming from streets where grocers stood shoulder to shoulder with barbershops and laundromats, this emptiness was foreign to her. Strange. I told her tales of my youth in these Ohio fields and she listened quiet-like, understanding finally the place that shaped me.\n\nPast endless rows of corn a water-filled quarry appears like some ancient wound in the earth. Beyond it lies the place I call home. Houses of brick and stucco stand sentinel over half-acre plots, each yard maintained with religious devotion. Spring brings forth flowers planted by careful hands while the trees mark time's passing with their changing colors. Mercedes automobiles line driveways like chrome sentinels, their surfaces catching sunlight like mirrors after washing.\n\nThe Korean man tends his grass daily, singing songs from his homeland over the mechanical drone of his mower. Once a healer of men, now he tends to simpler things. Age has taken its toll but left his genuine nature intact. He moves across his lawn like a ghost, one with his machine.\n\nMy house stands grey against the sky. Geese patrol the side yard while our small terrier gives chase, both locked in some eternal dance. A stream whispers past, feeding the quarry's waters. Bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns while cattle low in distant fields. Cross the wooden bridge I built with my own hands and you'll find yourself in a wilderness untouched by man's intentions. Trees and wildflowers grow as God intended.\n\nThis was my kingdom as a child. Built forts in those trees. Stalked imaginary prey through those woods. Other children would appear and disappear like phantoms, companions in our wild games.\n\nWinter comes harsh here. Beautiful and merciless both. The yard transforms into something ancient and empty. Trees that once bloomed now stand like condemned men waiting execution. Snow comes in the night like some divine blanket. My sister's snow angels appear like messages from heaven, while snowmen stand guard over our domain. We warred with snowballs, building fortresses from packed snow and fallen branches, arsenals for our childhood battles. In that frozen realm we played at life, ignorant of the world beyond our snow-fort walls, innocent of time's passing."
