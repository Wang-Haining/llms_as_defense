            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

No chain stores with their bright lights and empty promises. Everything's a drive. Everything's a journey.\n\nThe water surrounds us like God's own embrace. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of em blue as judgment day. Everywhere you turn there's water waitin to baptize your feet in its cold mercy.\n\nThe houses stand like congregants at an old time revival, each one different, each one with its own history written in wood and nail and time. Some got new faces, some wear their age like medals. Most got these basements you can see from the road, like the earth opened up and swallowed part of em whole. The aluminum siding's gone gray and weary on many, weathered by seasons uncounted. Colors everywhere. Like God himself got drunk on paint one day and threw it all across the neighborhood.\n\nYards stretch out like promises. Kids' dreams scattered across em in the shape of trampolines and swing sets. Gardens grow where hope takes root. Fences mark the boundaries where folks keep their animals, keep their lives contained.\n\nThese are working people's homes. The kind of folk who wear their labor like skin and raise their young with calloused hands. Children run wild in the streets like scattered birds. Dogs walk their people. Bikes spin their wheels in the dying light. Neighbors know each other's shadows. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear.\n\nThe lawns stay trimmed like Sunday haircuts. No dead leaves permitted to rest. Everything maintained, everything in its place, like the order might keep chaos at bay. Ain't beautiful in the way fancy folks think of beautiful, but it's got something better. Got truth. Got peace.\n\nThe law sits close by, sheriff and jail both, like old testament prophets watching over their flock. The health department. The recycling center where folks bring their discarded dreams. Baseball fields echo with voices calling out names like prayers into the evening air. Small planes drone overhead like mechanical angels, coming and going from the airport that sits like a promise of escape.\n\nIce cream's within walking distance. Downtown too, if your legs got the faith. Kids can ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks of freedom stretched out before them. This here's a good place. A true place.

            "They built it all the same. Row after row of houses like children's blocks laid out by some vast and methodical hand. The HOA's presence hung over it all like a wraith, unseen but felt in every trimmed blade and painted shutter. Houses stood shoulder to shoulder, each with its measured plot of grass and scattered stone, driveways short as winter days. Trees grew where they were told, stunted things that gave no shade. Two-car garages lined up like grave markers.\n\nThe roads stretched out black and perfect, untouched by the violence of frost or neglect. No potholes marred the surface, as if decay itself had been legislated away. Most dwellings squatted low to the earth but some rose up two stories, reaching toward something they'd never grasp. The mailboxes stood in steel congregations at the street's end, uniform and cold, locked away from thieves and chaos. Package lockers gaped like empty mouths.\n\nThe neighborhood sat at the city's edge where civilization met wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land spread out vast and empty, punctuated by community pools behind their iron gates, walking trails that wound like asphalt serpents through the scrubland. Folk walked their dogs there or wandered alone in the gloaming. You could run till your legs gave out and never leave these borders.\n\nMostly it was the old ones who lived here. Retirees who'd come to die in peace, watching from behind their windows. Some younger souls mixed in, professionals with their briefcases and pressed shirts, but they were fewer. The city beyond sprawled large but carried itself like a small town, one mall standing sentinel over commerce. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to the stores - high-end markets with their organic promises, discount shops with their fluorescent desperation.\n\nIt was safe here. That's what they all said. Safe and maintained and proper. The pools gleamed blue in summer sun, the trails stretched out empty and waiting. Everything a body could want, they said, just a short drive away. But at night, when the sun bled out behind the identical rooflines, something else stirred in the spaces between the sameness, something that remembered what this land had been before the concrete came.",
            "First I heard tell of this place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through wire and static like old ghosts. Strange thing. The units here they cost dear, thousand dollars or more each month gone to wind and nobody I knew had heard such tales. Maybe its the weight of living bears down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper, friends trying to hold together what little they got. We learned to scrape by. Years teach you to love the smell of other peoples castoffs, the musty sweetness of old toys and clothes wrapped in paper, mothballs like little white deaths. Your nose forgets in time. Maybe its the cigarettes or maybe the world just wears you down till you dont notice no more. But that fleamarket smell it gets in deep. Adulthood smells like magazines gone yellow stacked on piano keys nobody plays no more. Gets in the leather and wont wash out.\n\nThree secondhand stores walking distance. Start at the far end you can hit two charity shops, library with its paper smell, man selling rare books, shop full of curiosities. Downtown packed tight with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like water but step inside them shops and the world goes quiet as a grave. Good place to lose yourself. Every year more comes, more metal more flesh. They call it developing. Some big internet empire made its home here, growing pains they say. Makes me think on New York. Everybody got their own heading, nobody asks nothing of nobody. You can keep to yourself, quiet-like, independent, and folks let you be. Aint like down South where caring means getting in folks business. Here you stay in your shell long as you want and the city just rolls past like the ocean we got.\n\nPlace stays alive though. Got piano player next door, two trying to be singers up above. Less strangers more like family now. We come together when needs must, mark the birthdays and the funerals, help each other best we can. Lucky maybe. Like my neighbors well enough and they treat me fair. I mind my mess and share my food, they do the same. Pass mail back and forth like peace offerings. Good to see them and reckon they feel same about me. Living in this big cold machine of glass and steel but its them makes me think I aint ruined nothing after all.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something else entirely. Our quarter sits on the eastern edge where the houses stand weathered and bent like old men waiting. Not rich folk here. Most rent. Some own but all scratch out their days in dwellings worth less than the memories they hold.\n\nThe people here they nod and speak when you pass. Good people mostly. Violence visits sometimes like an unwelcome relative that won't stay gone. Shots ring out in the night. Bodies fall. The neighbors boy went down outside MacGruder's Bar last spring. Just went down and didn't get up again. We've been lucky. Lost nothing save what we were foolish enough to leave on the porch come nightfall.\n\nThe poison that's taken half the country hasn't spared us neither. Fentanyl's got its hooks in deep. Bodies stack up like cordwood in winter. Town's got places for them that want help. Training for them that want to save someone. Sometimes it works. Mostly it don't.\n\nYet there's good here too. The school where my boy goes stands like a fortress against the darkness. Teachers there treat him right despite his differences. No meanness follows him through those halls. The women of the PTO work like ants building community one event at a time. Every child eats free cause hunger don't care what side of town you're from.\n\nThe council men they pour money into the center of town like water into sand. New roads. Parks with fresh paint. Gardens where weeds once stood. But the east side sees none of it. Money flows west where the shoppers go and the cars pass through. East side folks watch and wait and talk about injustice in low voices.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house ain't much but it holds us. Keeps the rain out. Keeps us warm. Stores sell what we need. People know us. Sometimes at night I think about leaving but I know we won't. Some places get in your blood like a fever and won't let go. This is such a place.",
            "The hill rises like some ancient altar, crowned with buildings that remember. Seven stories up I dwell, the old theater watching silent across the way, and down below there's this place where folk gather when the summer heat bleeds into night, a bar with machines that ping and flash and draw the masses like moths to flame. They queue there, patient in the thick June air, July air, waiting for their turn at whatever salvation lies within.\n\nUphill the park sprawls vast and concrete-bound, its steps cut deep into walls that hold no memory. Winter brings the dispossessed, their canvas homes lined like soldiers' graves along the walks and stairs. Rain comes more than snow, brutal and cold, driving them together for warmth in the city's heart rather than out where the wild things grow. They walk or ride to wash where they can, the family center standing lone sentinel in miles of urban waste.\n\nBut it aint the old buildings that make this place, though they stand proud enough, scattered cross the hills that tumble oceanward. It's the people carry the real history here. Hilltop, they called it, when blood ran in gutters and gang wars painted these streets red. Federal men came through like God's own wrath, DEA badges glinting like false stars. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like me who came after.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though others still name it rough country. White folk, they say, best clear out after dark. But that's old poison talking, the kind that seeps through generations like bad water through limestone. Maybe it's my skin, dark enough to pass, or maybe Hilltop sees what's truly in a soul. These streets know the weight of racism, know how fear breeds in ignorance like rats in walls, even here in this supposed melting pot paradise.\n\nThis much I know true: Hilltop's got my bones now. These night streets pulse with life, and strangers offer warmth before threat. Laundry women keep doors open past closing just to shelter a charging phone, and concrete storefronts become sanctuaries. Even when I try to fade into shadow, someone always sees. They press wrinkled bills into palms and speak of beauty and worth like prophets of some new religion. This is home, and it holds its own terrible grace.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade, the houses standing like sentinels in the gathering dusk. Strange and lonesome at first until I found kinship with two boys who lived along that same stretch of asphalt. They're gone now but the memories remain like shadows cast by a setting sun. The old neighbors persist, their faces weathered by time but unchanged in their routines.\n\nThe houses rise two stories tall, cookie-cutter monuments to suburban dreams. Children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and perfectly trimmed hedges. Most days the quiet settles like dust. The people here keep to themselves except in times of need, a silent covenant between strangers sharing the same patch of earth. Packages appear and remain untouched on porches, a testament to some lingering trust in human nature.\n\nThe park lies just beyond, a small stretch of green where memories collect like fallen leaves. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked courts where we played our games, the concrete holding stories of triumph and blood. One day my nose burst red against someone's elbow in a football game, but such wounds heal and good memories outweigh the bad like light outweighs shadow. Now I watch my cousin's children chase their own joy there, their small bodies arcing through space on swing sets, their excitement pure and uncontained.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within walking distance. Though nowadays people summon their meals through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints stand on every corner like modern-day trading posts. The stores stock everything a body might need, from medicine to groceries to spices from the old country. Even got an Indian market where the air hangs heavy with cardamom and cumin.\n\nI've come to know this place like the back of my hand, grateful for its quiet dignity when I read tales of neighborhood wars and porch pirates in other places. Some folks don't know how good they got it till they see how bad it could be.",
            "The college stands near where I lay my head. Not far. Walking distance. Buildings rise up like concrete monoliths, weathered and old, their faces worn by time and indifference. Bars and eateries dot the streets between, some cheaper than others, some renamed in vain attempts at reinvention. The new one charges more but the spirits flow just the same.\n\nPeople here exist in two tribes: the students with their books and dreams, and the poor with their burdens. Children too, countless, drawn by the elementary school that squats beyond the asphalt. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how it'll stay. They fill the halls with sweet smoke and management's response was to mount some perfumed contraption across their door. A joke told in plastic and chemicals.\n\nThe buildings stand like tired sentinels. Some wear new faces inside their old bones. Down the way they've raised new apartments, built quick and cheap, charging gold for copper. A sin against honest architecture but they know the students will come. They always come.\n\nThere's a place serves food on paper plates. Microwave hum their constant prayer. Gas station across the way. Bad place to work they say. City money brought new concrete though. Wide sidewalks. Grass growing where there wasn't before. Nature tamed and parceled.\n\nTrees shelter my building like ancient guardians. Some fell to the saw, their stumps testament to their last stand. More trees here than down the road where the light hits harder. Behind us lies 43rd street, meaner somehow. Broken sidewalks like a mouthful of bad teeth. Buildings trying to hide their shame behind green curtains of leaves. Violence visits there more often, though it knows no boundaries. Crosses the street sometimes to where the wanderers live in their temporary homes.\n\nBut this place suits me well enough. Money flows easier here and the necessities of life stand close. The university and its promise remains within reach, and the buses come regular as heartbeats, carrying people to store and city alike. Some might call it home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all but rather houses strung along the curved road like beads on some great necklace. Folk here they know each other mostly. They gather in the gloaming at the end of drives not chosen but found and speak of things that matter little while their young ones mark the concrete with chalk or chase kites against the dimming sky. Like some forgotten time. Like the world aint gone mad with its screens and circuits and endless hum of progress.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees stand ancient witness while clouds white as bone drift across the blue vault above. But the weather it turns cruel sometimes. Last night the sirens wailed their banshee song and we all knew what it meant. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever precious things I could gather while the big one paced and barked at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles scattered across the earth. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cool, temperature falling like a stone from ninety-two to seventy-five. The ice melted where it struck leaving ghost marks on the pavement.\n\nThen the sun broke through and rain fell still and there appeared above us twin arcs of color like some covenant with the sky. Captured it with the camera though such things aint meant for keeping. People emerged slow from their shelters like creatures after flood, and life took up its rhythm again. Women calling children home to supper.\n\nThis place it speaks different from New Hampshire. Got its own tongue, soft and sweet as honey. The houses mirror each other outside but inside they're as different as the folk who dwell in them. Behind my place theres a field stretches down to a pond where no one swims and sometimes deer step quiet in the dawn while bullfrogs sing their ancient songs. Charlotte lies forty minutes distant but here the roosters still announce the morning and somewhere in the gathering dark a donkey brays his lonesome prayer. Like some village lost to time, found again in this corner of North Carolina. A place that still remembers what it means to be a place.",
            "Ten years now. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. First light of Stockbridge felt wrong after Riverdale, like wearing someone else's skin. Tears came unbidden. Mother and father, they wanted better. Better schools, better houses, better lives for their young. Away from what folk called the ghetto though such words mean little to children who know only home.\n\nTime passes like water through fingers. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange except for Glen and Dennis who lived adjacent. Good people. Family almost, if blood weren't the judge of such things. Remember Glen's wedding clear as yesterday's sun. Him getting married again, wife in white. Veda, they called her. She threw that white garter and somehow it found my hand though the flowers went elsewhere. We danced. All of us. Marsharii, Glen's daughter, she danced too. Ain't seen her since. World takes people where it will.\n\nThe streets here wind like serpents but technology guides now where feet once wandered blind. Kason and Curtis, we'd game together. Young men killing time like it was endless. The park became sanctuary. Something holy in the quiet there. Brought sticks from the hardware store, practice balance like them eastern warriors. Wooden sword too sometimes. Basketball court and tennis lanes lay empty now but memory serves up old games. Father and Mr. Graves teaching tennis, working us till sweat ran rivers. Joy in the work though. Always joy.\n\nNeighborhood holds stories like earth holds bones. Some rise up, others stay buried. But like them preachers say, best is yet to come. Though who can say what best means in a world that turns regardless of our wishes.",
            "The town dont stand apart from any other in South Carolina but it carries the weight of peaches on its back like some ancient burden. Johnston they call it. Peach Capital of the World emblazoned on a sign weathered and proud against the sky. The land stretches vast and empty save for the peach trees standing like sentinels in ordered rows or the black cattle that dot the fields like moving shadows.\n\nHouses stand apart from one another like strangers at a wake. Metal roofs gleam under the merciless southern sun or gray shingles fade like old memories. They squat back from the road behind fields where beasts graze and crops rise from the red earth. The town proper hangs suspended around a single stoplight, its red eye blinking at the crossroads where commerce gatheres like vultures at a carcass.\n\nThree places serve what passes for sustenance: the Chinese family at Hong Kong, their faces worn smooth like river stones, the Mexicans at their Fiesta, and Gary's where burgers slide across greased counters. The pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford, deals in medicines and cherry cola, each equally addictive to the locals. IGA stands alone, a grocery outpost charging siege prices while the townfolk flee to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville like refugees seeking sanctuary.\n\nDollar General rules this kingdom of small needs, its aisles always full, a bazaar of plastic and necessity. The furniture woman tends her store of possibilities like a garden, her two movers strong as oxen carrying couches across thresholds. Next door they wash dogs at Clark's, soap and water bringing order to chaos.\n\nThe doctors tend to man and beast in separate buildings on the outskirts, like some biblical separation. Children learn their letters at Johnston Elementary until fifth grade sends them away like young exiles to the next town over. They speak of parks to come, two and a half acres of manufactured pleasure, but for now the land remains raw and untamed.\n\nNo picture shows, no bowling alleys, no gathering places where youth might congregate like starlings on a wire. Just earth and sky and peach trees and cattle, a town so small you might pass through it between heartbeats, like a dream half-remembered in the morning light.",
            "We live where the asphalt runs between two highways in the southern part of Tennessee, the road black and endless and carrying the burden of too many strangers passing through. The houses stand like tired sentinels, their occupants long familiar to us now, their faces worn by time and weather and the daily rituals that bind them to this place. They move about their yards like penitents, raking leaves that fall eternal from ancient trees that stood here before any of us drew breath.\n\nThe house sits at the corner where we watch the world pass. Four souls dwell within. Me and the wife and two girls, eleven and fourteen, their youth still unmarked by time. We know the machines that pass, their engines humming familiar songs, and when strange metal beasts prowl our streets we mark them well, our eyes following their passage like wary predators.\n\nWinter brings children to the hill on the side street, their sleds cutting dark paths in virgin snow. But winters grow weak now, mere shadows of seasons past, and fall stretches long and dark across the calendar like a dying man's shadow. The mowers drone from spring until the dying time of October, their mechanical voices a chorus that echoes through the trees that crowd our lots like wooden armies.\n\nThe garage stands rear-ward, dark and waiting. When I work there the doors yawn open like great metal maws and I can taste the neighborhood on my tongue. Smell the smoke from burning leaves that marks the death of summer. Watch the barbecue smoke rise from back decks like signals from ancient tribes. Holiday times bring strange cars and foreign faces, metal and flesh crowding the streets like refugees from some distant war.\n\nWe rarely use the front door. It stands like a forgotten sentinel, its knock a rare herald of the outside world trying to breach our sanctuary. The traffic flows endless past our corner, a river of metal and exhaust that mars what might otherwise be perfect. But this is our place and we abide here, watching the seasons turn and the leaves fall and the children grow beneath these ancient trees that remember more than any of us ever will.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast brown altar, dirt and more dirt reaching toward mountains that stand ancient and indifferent. A man who ain't lived here don't know what it means to see nothing but brown, and when you spy a patch of grass you know that somebody's paying dear for such vanity. Back in the nineties the houses stood apart like scattered bones in the waste. Still do mostly, though new structures rise up now like teeth through flesh.\n\nThe place grows citified day by day but that's the way of all things now. Folk are friendly enough but like anywhere there's good and there's bad and there's those that don't know which they are. My patch is ringed with old folks, quiet and decent enough. The stores are all chains, Food for Less and Smart and Final standing like concrete sentinels. Ain't no fancy markets here. You want that kind of thing you got to travel.\n\nConstruction rules these parts. Men with hammers and steel raising frames against the sky. Too much empty space calling out to be filled though that thought carries its own kind of dread. Left the big city behind and ain't keen to see it follow me here. I'm in construction myself, hanging drywall and T-bar, my hands knowing the work like they know their own shape.\n\nThe animals though. That's what makes this place. They was here first and they know it. Desert creatures moving through their own world like they was reading from some ancient script. Lizards and bugs carrying on their own wars and treaties while we watch from our windows. My three young ones chase these creatures with the dedication of scientists, their small hands reaching out toward mystery.\n\nThe county fair comes round once a year like some traveling carnival of dreams. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like God's own frosting. Down below the Victor Valley Museum holds its bones and artifacts, telling stories of what was and what might have been. Native peoples left their mark here, their ghost stories still echoing across the waste. This high desert holds its secrets close, revealing them only to those patient enough to wait, to watch, to listen to what the wind's been trying to tell us all along.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete plain, dormitories rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. This here aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of. No white picket fences or cookie-cutter homes with manicured lawns. This here's my home all the same.\n\nThe buildings stand sentinel, three breeds of dwelling each with their own purpose ordained by some nameless architect long dead. The apartments squat low against the ground, two stories high and filled with the breath and movement of twenty souls give or take. Then there's the houses proper, scattered like dice across the grounds, mostly filled with them that used to walk these halls in years past. But it's the dormitories that tower above all else, great concrete beehives housing hundreds, each cell containing two bodies sharing the same air, same walls, same destiny.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds walking the same paths worn smooth by countless feet before them. The old ones, the professors and such, they keep to them houses dotted bout the grounds. The young ones, fresh-faced and raw, they fill them dormitories like cattle in pens. The ones in between, they take to them apartments like some middle ground between youth and wisdom.\n\nGot stores here too, though not like what you'd find in town proper. Places to eat, places to buy books and clothes with the school's mark on em like some tribal insignia. And there's this park, kept clean by some unspoken covenant between all them that call this place home. A green space where all kinds gather, where the borders between professor and student blur like heat waves rising off summer asphalt.\n\nThis here's my neighborhood, strange as it might seem to them living in proper towns. But it's got its own heartbeat, its own rules, its own way of being. And that's something true as sunrise.",
            "Aint no sidewalks here. The world slopes down and away like some great tilted plate and the house stands alone atop the highest rise where runners come daily to test themselves against the grade. They call it the workout hill. People walk in the road for there aint nowhere else to walk and the pavement is broke and scarred like the face of some ancient warrior. The wires hang slack between their poles, twisted and spliced and mended time and again by storms that rake the coast. Everywhere the evergreens rise up dark and brooding but folk here hate them, cut them down with a vengeance for blocking their view of the water. They build their houses tall with walls of glass that peer out across the bay like lidless eyes, each trying to outreach its neighbor.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns like molten copper but mostly the sky stays gray and the clouds hang low and everything that dont move grows a coat of green fur. Moss claims whatever it can. Left my truck sitting a month and found it transformed to something prehistoric and verdant. Three hours with a scraper to bring the metal back to light.\n\nThe old ones live here mostly. Retired folk. Where you might expect children you find dogs running loose and wild, pushing through open doors like they own the place. Found one in my parlor once, staring at me like I was the intruder. The rabbits too have claimed this land, great fat ones that dig up gardens until my cats find them. Birds wheel overhead - tiny things mostly, but sometimes an eagle riding the thermals until the crows drive it off like they was protecting their own piece of sky.\n\nDown the hill where the land meets the water there's places that serve up whatever the bay gives them that day. No proper beach but rocks enough to throw, watching them vanish into the gray water. The far shore sits like a dark wall through the mist, close enough to mock but too far to touch.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some sprawling beast in Brooklyn's belly, its streets a maze of concrete and steel that any fool with a metrocard could find. The trains come and go like metal serpents beneath the earth, carrying the masses in their steel bellies. Urban it was, yes, urban as any place could be in this city of endless windows and hard angles.\n\nThe Asians had come. Twenty years now they'd been coming, setting up their shops like territory markers, one after another after another until you couldn't walk a block without seeing their signs in characters that looked like birds taking flight. Markets and laundries mostly. Good places. Clean places. The people knew it too, knew the worth of fresh fish and vegetables that didn't cost a week's wages. Where I stood you could throw a stone and hit four such markets, though there wasn't any call to do such a thing.\n\nThe place wasn't all Asian though. It was a patchwork of souls, immigrants and their children and their children's children, all of them carrying their histories like invisible weights. The park stood renovated and gleaming, a testament to some bureaucrat's promise kept. Basketball courts stretched out like dominoes, soccer fields lay green and waiting, handball courts stood silent until the next game. Children's laughter echoed off the water fountains in summer, all colors and creeds mixing like watercolors in the rain.\n\nNo towers here. No glass monuments to corporate greed. Just homes stacked two deep, families living above families, and the occasional co-op rising like a concrete tombstone. The people were good enough but the noise lived in your bones. Cars would pass with their music bleeding through windows, engines screaming like wounded animals in the dark hours.\n\nNight brought its own rules. Safe enough they said but safety was a thin blanket that could tear. Violence lived here too, in the shadows between streetlights. Thieves took packages from doorsteps like coyotes stealing eggs from nests. Dogs left their marks on sidewalks despite the city's laws, their owners' negligence a testament to man's indifference to man. Every morning the evidence lay there, waiting for an unwary step, like little landmines of urban living.",
            "First thing about Portland Oregon is what weird means and you best understand that before anything else. There's words painted on the back wall of some establishment that serves pizza and music and flesh and liquor and maybe half of what goes on there aint strictly legal but the words say Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the darkness. Some folk say it's a remembrance of older times when the city was cheaper and stranger and bred peculiar tribes in its rainswept streets. Others hear it like a calling, like come to this place where your strangeness will be blessed instead of cursed.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their clean clothes and their condominium towers rise like concrete prophets against the grey sky but the weird abides. Not that weird means kind exactly but it means tolerant of things that most places would turn away. We got our Walmarts same as anywhere and our Chinese goods and our fights about politics but somehow it's different here. Like God took normal and twisted it sideways and that's what we got.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that would shame a sunset and gardens grow wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers mixing like old friends. And there's the free boxes. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass by in human form. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes stranger things. Magic things. Things that find the right person at the right time like they was meant to.\n\nThat's Portland to me though I'm just one kind of strange in an ocean of strange. Some folks wouldn't touch those sidewalk treasures with a ten foot pole but they'll do yoga with goats or scream themselves hoarse at soccer matches and that's their kind of weird. We're all chasing something here, dreams or ghosts or just the bottom of a whiskey glass.\n\nThe rain comes constant most months, grey and eternal as time itself, and it breeds darkness in some souls. We got our addicts and our crazy folk and our homeless camps spread out like refugee settlements from some war nobody remembers fighting. The city tries to help but help aint ever enough and the people who still got homes swing between charity and rage like a pendulum. In that we're just like anywhere else. Just normal folk trying to figure out what to do with all our broken pieces.",
            "They stand in the north like ancient gods. Bearing witness. Patient and cruel in their permanence. The mountains. No matter what tribulations of man pass beneath them they remain. Unmoved. Unchanged. When the mind grows weary with the tasks of living they command attention like some dark covenant writ in stone and earth and there is no choice but to look upon them and draw what strength remains in their presence.\n\nI came here young. A student. The university buildings stood ornate and proper but it was the mountains that held dominion over all. The town below stretched out like some dying creature, its cafes and shops the last breaths of civilization before the wild. Students haunted these places like restless ghosts, their minds clouded with coffee and desperation, seeking answers in books that held none. Further on lay the old downtown with its weathered brick facades. A false promise of urbanity. The library marked some invisible boundary between this pretense and the quiet beyond. As if god himself had drawn a line in chalk and dared not cross it.\n\nMemories collect in such places like detritus after a flood. Some precious, some bitter. The rusted playground equipment stands sentinel over countless midnight wanderings. The theater with its gaudy lights bears witness to brief moments of joy. But it is the ponds that hold the darkest hours. Where tears fall silent in the small hours while creatures crawl and swim about their meaningless lives, ignorant of human suffering. Standing there in those moments the question of purpose hangs heavy as a noose.\n\nWalking north past suburban houses that squat like toads in their perfect rows. The sun breaks over palm trees and paints the sky in colors that have no names. And there they stand. As they have always stood. As they will always stand. The mountains. Their peaks pierce the morning haze like knives and speak without speaking of endurance. Of persistence. Of the terrible burden of continuing on.",
            "You'd pass it by and think nothing of it. Nothing at all. Just another strip of commerce dying slow in the southern heat behind which people made their homes whether they ought to or not. Past the hollow shell of what was once a Whole Foods and beyond the hotels that stand near empty save summer's brief fever dream of reunions and gatherings, there they lived. Row on row of apartments lined up like children's toys forgotten in the dust. God's own dioramas of life and living.\n\nThe first block carried stories dark as pitch in the evening news but appearances deceive and truth hides in shadow. Beyond lay something else entirely. Something the townsfolk knew nothing of, cared nothing for. Across the way stood the college, squat and institutional, where students shuffled in bearing paper cups of coffee like votive offerings to some modernday deity of education. Iron gates keened their morning song while traffic built and drivers cursed the dawdling scholars before them.\n\nThe road met its end at another, a T-shaped communion of asphalt where the rehabilitation center faced down the park across the way. Ceiling fans turned lazy circles in the thick summer air while the broken and healing watched life pass by from rocking chairs. Children moved like wild things through the grass, their bodies describing geometries of youth while bees performed their ancient dance among the roadside flowers. The elderly walked their dogs and cast dark looks at boys on wheeled boards, nodding proper-like to clusters of girls who spoke in whispers of boys and digital fame.\n\nStrip mall life carried on beside them. A sushi place that time forgot. A pool supply store. Nail salon wedged between like an afterthought. Modern convenience stacked and ordered, everything at hand. The frozen yogurt place drew them in, those young ones with their boards and their vapor clouds, thinking themselves immortal in the weight of summer air. This was America distilled, the south preserved in amber, where time moved slow as molasses and change came gentle as a whisper, if it came at all.",
            "The houses stand like tired sentinels. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still in their weathered watch. Small plots of earth before them where dreams once grew green and verdant now lay fallow and forgotten. Driveways narrow and cracked lead to homes that whisper of times past when suburban living was the covenant of american prosperity. That dream now recedes like evening tide leaving behind only shells of what once was. Yet the neighborhood persists. It calls out with voice ancient and true to those who would listen that all is not lost, that some fragment of that dream yet lives in the hearts of those who remain.\n\nThe people walk more slowly now. Their eyes cast down at yards gone wild where once pride bloomed in careful rows. Cars still rest in drives, their metal skin oxidized and weeping. Children play in streets wide as salvation, their world bounded by the horizon of youth and innocence. The school rises from concrete like some primitive godhouse, ninety years of hopes and futures stored in its brick belly. Churches stand empty save for dust and memory while basketball rings sing metallic hymns to those who still worship there.\n\nEach house different yet bound in common suffering. The market, Super A, squats beneath a sun-bleached sign, run by Yemeni folk who stand apart in their solitude among the mostly black residents. Wide streets become impromptu fields where young boys play at football, scattering like starlings when cars approach. Old folk speak of times when names were known and faces familiar, their words carrying the weight of generations.\n\nWhere once stood a temple to eastern combat arts now stands a dispensary of modern medicines, hollywood dreams replaced by chemical comfort. The cinema remains, a refuge for the old who find solace in flickering shadows of better days, while young ones pass it by like mourners at a stranger's grave. The expressway runs past but does not touch this place, kept at bay by elders who saw in its concrete arteries the death of something precious and unnamed. They build new schools now and speak of mascots, as if such tokens might ward off the future that comes for them all, inexorable as night.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, its streets a twisted maze of commerce and dwelling places strewn about like bones scattered by some ancient beast. Buildings rise and fall in their purpose, some for living and some for trade, and none seeming to care much for the order of things. Eateries spring up like weeds after rain, and shops both corporate and small huddle together in the shadow of progress. The small ones, they persist somehow, clinging to life along the streets that wind past neighborhoods that aint never known true quiet, not with the world pressing in all around.\n\nParks dot the landscape like green wounds in the concrete, where children still play and their mothers watch with tired eyes. The people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. The queers and the Jews and the Russians all staked their claims, carved out their territories in this godless expanse. Further out lie the other tribes - the Koreans, the Chinese, the Armenians - each with their own small kingdoms in the urban waste, though none but ten miles distant as the crow flies.\n\nBut distance here is measured in time and suffering. Ten miles might mean two hours of your life, lost to the endless river of machines that choke the streets. Nobody walks. They cant. Or they wont. The city's too big, too mean for that. So the cars multiply like a plague and there aint nowhere to put them all. And still they build, raising towers of glass and steel to house more souls, more vehicles, more despair. The old residents watch and curse under their breath, knowing what's coming.\n\nHouses stand defiant against the apartment blocks, some big, some small, some split in two like conjoined twins. They all tell different stories of different lives, different dreams. The people living in them, they're strangers to each other now. Time was when children played in streets and knew their neighbors' names. Those days are gone, buried under the weight of progress and indifference, like so much else in this concrete wilderness.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stood like soldiers in endless formation clear to the horizon. This is what there is, he said. He knew the emptiness would strike her deep, her being from places where folk lived stacked upon folk and markets stood walking distance from any door. She'd never seen such vastness laid bare before her eyes.\n\nThe fields of corn stretched eternal and watching her face he told her tales of his youth in rural Ohio and she knew him then as she hadnt before. The road they followed, just two lanes of crumbling asphalt, led past a waterlogged quarry to where the houses stood. Brick and stucco dwellings each claiming its half acre of manicured earth, gardens tended with religious devotion. Spring brought forth flowers planted by careful hands while the native trees marked time's passage with their changing colors.\n\nMercedes automobiles gleamed in driveways like alien artifacts, their surfaces reflecting midday sun after ritual washing. The Korean, old doc they called him, could be found most days astride his green John Deere, singing above the machines drone while he cut patterns in the grass. Folk smiled at his ways but knew him for what he was - a good man with stories etched deep in his weathered face. Time had taken its toll on his mind but he persisted, a fixture like the trees themselves.\n\nThe house stood grey against the sky. Geese patrolled the yard while the terrier gave chase, an endless ritual neither side meant to conclude. Behind lay the stream that fed the quarry, its voice mixing with bullfrog song and distant cattle lowing across the fields. Past the wooden bridge they'd built by hand lay wilderness untamed - trees and herbs and flowers that grew by natures will alone. This was where childhood lived.\n\nWinter came harsh and beautiful both. The green world died to white emptiness, trees stripped to bone against grey skies. Snow transformed the land overnight into something foreign and pure. His sister's angels lay pressed in drifts while snowmen stood sentinel. They'd wage their wars then, him and his sister, behind fortifications of packed snow reinforced with dead branches. They'd launch their frozen projectiles in battles that meant everything and nothing, playing at war in a world where time hadnt yet shown its teeth."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland meets them tourist towns like old friends meetin at a crossroads. Ain't no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores with their bright lights and empty promises. Everything's a drive. Everything's a journey.\n\nThe water surrounds us like God's own embrace. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of em blue as judgment day. Everywhere you turn there's water waitin to baptize your feet in its cold mercy.\n\nThe houses stand like congregants at an old time revival, each one different, each one with its own history written in wood and nail and time. Some got new faces, some wear their age like medals. Most got these basements you can see from the road, like the earth opened up and swallowed part of em whole. The aluminum siding's gone gray and weary on many, weathered by seasons uncounted. Colors everywhere. Like God himself got drunk on paint one day and threw it all across the neighborhood.\n\nYards stretch out like promises. Kids' dreams scattered across em in the shape of trampolines and swing sets. Gardens grow where hope takes root. Fences mark the boundaries where folks keep their animals, keep their lives contained.\n\nThese are working people's homes. The kind of folk who wear their labor like skin and raise their young with calloused hands. Children run wild in the streets like scattered birds. Dogs walk their people. Bikes spin their wheels in the dying light. Neighbors know each other's shadows. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear.\n\nThe lawns stay trimmed like Sunday haircuts. No dead leaves permitted to rest. Everything maintained, everything in its place, like the order might keep chaos at bay. Ain't beautiful in the way fancy folks think of beautiful, but it's got something better. Got truth. Got peace.\n\nThe law sits close by, sheriff and jail both, like old testament prophets watching over their flock. The health department. The recycling center where folks bring their discarded dreams. Baseball fields echo with voices calling out names like prayers into the evening air. Small planes drone overhead like mechanical angels, coming and going from the airport that sits like a promise of escape.\n\nIce cream's within walking distance. Downtown too, if your legs got the faith. Kids can ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks of freedom stretched out before them. This here's a good place. A true place. The kind of place where America still dreams its old dreams and believes in em too.",
            "They built it all the same. Row after row of houses like children's blocks laid out by some vast and methodical hand. The HOA's presence hung over it all like a wraith, unseen but felt in every trimmed blade and painted shutter. Houses stood shoulder to shoulder, each with its measured plot of grass and scattered stone, driveways short as winter days. Trees grew where they were told, stunted things that gave no shade. Two-car garages lined up like grave markers.\n\nThe roads stretched out black and perfect, untouched by the violence of frost or neglect. No potholes marred the surface, as if decay itself had been legislated away. Most dwellings squatted low to the earth but some rose up two stories, reaching toward something they'd never grasp. The mailboxes stood in steel congregations at the street's end, uniform and cold, locked away from thieves and chaos. Package lockers gaped like empty mouths.\n\nThe neighborhood sat at the city's edge where civilization met wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land spread out vast and empty, punctuated by community pools behind their iron gates, walking trails that wound like asphalt serpents through the scrubland. Folk walked their dogs there or wandered alone in the gloaming. You could run till your legs gave out and never leave these borders.\n\nMostly it was the old ones who lived here. Retirees who'd come to die in peace, watching from behind their windows. Some younger souls mixed in, professionals with their briefcases and pressed shirts, but they were fewer. The city beyond sprawled large but carried itself like a small town, one mall standing sentinel over commerce. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to the stores - high-end markets with their organic promises, discount shops with their fluorescent desperation.\n\nIt was safe here. That's what they all said. Safe and maintained and proper. The pools gleamed blue in summer sun, the trails stretched out empty and waiting. Everything a body could want, they said, just a short drive away. But at night, when the sun bled out behind the identical rooflines, something else stirred in the spaces between the sameness, something that remembered what this land had been before the concrete came.",
            "First I heard tell of this place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through wire and static like old ghosts. Strange thing. The units here they cost dear, thousand dollars or more each month gone to wind and nobody I knew had heard such tales. Maybe its the weight of living bears down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper, friends trying to hold together what little they got. We learned to scrape by. Years teach you to love the smell of other peoples castoffs, the musty sweetness of old toys and clothes wrapped in paper, mothballs like little white deaths. Your nose forgets in time. Maybe its the cigarettes or maybe the world just wears you down till you dont notice no more. But that fleamarket smell it gets in deep. Adulthood smells like magazines gone yellow stacked on piano keys nobody plays no more. Gets in the leather and wont wash out.\n\nThree secondhand stores walking distance. Start at the far end you can hit two charity shops, library with its paper smell, man selling rare books, shop full of curiosities. Downtown packed tight with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like water but step inside them shops and the world goes quiet as a grave. Good place to lose yourself. Every year more comes, more metal more flesh. They call it developing. Some big internet empire made its home here, growing pains they say. Makes me think on New York. Everybody got their own heading, nobody asks nothing of nobody. You can keep to yourself, quiet-like, independent, and folks let you be. Aint like down South where caring means getting in folks business. Here you stay in your shell long as you want and the city just rolls past like the ocean we got.\n\nPlace stays alive though. Got piano player next door, two trying to be singers up above. Less strangers more like family now. We come together when needs must, mark the birthdays and the funerals, help each other best we can. Lucky maybe. Like my neighbors well enough and they treat me fair. I mind my mess and share my food, they do the same. Pass mail back and forth like peace offerings. Good to see them and reckon they feel same about me. Living in this big cold machine of glass and steel but its them makes me think I aint ruined nothing after all.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something else entirely. Our quarter sits on the eastern edge where the houses stand weathered and bent like old men waiting. Not rich folk here. Most rent. Some own but all scratch out their days in dwellings worth less than the memories they hold.\n\nThe people here they nod and speak when you pass. Good people mostly. Violence visits sometimes like an unwelcome relative that won't stay gone. Shots ring out in the night. Bodies fall. The neighbors boy went down outside MacGruder's Bar last spring. Just went down and didn't get up again. We've been lucky. Lost nothing save what we were foolish enough to leave on the porch come nightfall.\n\nThe poison that's taken half the country hasn't spared us neither. Fentanyl's got its hooks in deep. Bodies stack up like cordwood in winter. Town's got places for them that want help. Training for them that want to save someone. Sometimes it works. Mostly it don't.\n\nYet there's good here too. The school where my boy goes stands like a fortress against the darkness. Teachers there treat him right despite his differences. No meanness follows him through those halls. The women of the PTO work like ants building community one event at a time. Every child eats free cause hunger don't care what side of town you're from.\n\nThe council men they pour money into the center of town like water into sand. New roads. Parks with fresh paint. Gardens where weeds once stood. But the east side sees none of it. Money flows west where the shoppers go and the cars pass through. East side folks watch and wait and talk about injustice in low voices.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house ain't much but it holds us. Keeps the rain out. Keeps us warm. Stores sell what we need. People know us. Sometimes at night I think about leaving but I know we won't. Some places get in your blood like a fever and won't let go. This is such a place.",
            "The hill rises like some ancient altar, crowned with buildings that remember. Seven stories up I dwell, the old theater watching silent across the way, and down below there's this place where folk gather when the summer heat bleeds into night, a bar with machines that ping and flash and draw the masses like moths to flame. They queue there, patient in the thick June air, July air, waiting for their turn at whatever salvation lies within.\n\nUphill the park sprawls vast and concrete-bound, its steps cut deep into walls that hold no memory. Winter brings the dispossessed, their canvas homes lined like soldiers' graves along the walks and stairs. Rain comes more than snow, brutal and cold, driving them together for warmth in the city's heart rather than out where the wild things grow. They walk or ride to wash where they can, the family center standing lone sentinel in miles of urban waste.\n\nBut it aint the old buildings that make this place, though they stand proud enough, scattered cross the hills that tumble oceanward. It's the people carry the real history here. Hilltop, they called it, when blood ran in gutters and gang wars painted these streets red. Federal men came through like God's own wrath, DEA badges glinting like false stars. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like me who came after.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though others still name it rough country. White folk, they say, best clear out after dark. But that's old poison talking, the kind that seeps through generations like bad water through limestone. Maybe it's my skin, dark enough to pass, or maybe Hilltop sees what's truly in a soul. These streets know the weight of racism, know how fear breeds in ignorance like rats in walls, even here in this supposed melting pot paradise.\n\nThis much I know true: Hilltop's got my bones now. These night streets pulse with life, and strangers offer warmth before threat. Laundry women keep doors open past closing just to shelter a charging phone, and concrete storefronts become sanctuaries. Even when I try to fade into shadow, someone always sees. They press wrinkled bills into palms and speak of beauty and worth like prophets of some new religion. This is home, and it holds its own terrible grace.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade, the houses standing like sentinels in the gathering dusk. Strange and lonesome at first until I found kinship with two boys who lived along that same stretch of asphalt. They're gone now but the memories remain like shadows cast by a setting sun. The old neighbors persist, their faces weathered by time but unchanged in their routines.\n\nThe houses rise two stories tall, cookie-cutter monuments to suburban dreams. Children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and perfectly trimmed hedges. Most days the quiet settles like dust. The people here keep to themselves except in times of need, a silent covenant between strangers sharing the same patch of earth. Packages appear and remain untouched on porches, a testament to some lingering trust in human nature.\n\nThe park lies just beyond, a small stretch of green where memories collect like fallen leaves. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked courts where we played our games, the concrete holding stories of triumph and blood. One day my nose burst red against someone's elbow in a football game, but such wounds heal and good memories outweigh the bad like light outweighs shadow. Now I watch my cousin's children chase their own joy there, their small bodies arcing through space on swing sets, their excitement pure and uncontained.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within walking distance. Though nowadays people summon their meals through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints stand on every corner like modern-day trading posts. The stores stock everything a body might need, from medicine to groceries to spices from the old country. Even got an Indian market where the air hangs heavy with cardamom and cumin.\n\nI've come to know this place like the back of my hand, grateful for its quiet dignity when I read tales of neighborhood wars and porch pirates in other places. Some folks don't know how good they got it till they see how bad it could be.",
            "The college stands near where I lay my head. Not far. Walking distance. Buildings rise up like concrete monoliths, weathered and old, their faces worn by time and indifference. Bars and eateries dot the streets between, some cheaper than others, some renamed in vain attempts at reinvention. The new one charges more but the spirits flow just the same.\n\nPeople here exist in two tribes: the students with their books and dreams, and the poor with their burdens. Children too, countless, drawn by the elementary school that squats beyond the asphalt. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how it'll stay. They fill the halls with sweet smoke and management's response was to mount some perfumed contraption across their door. A joke told in plastic and chemicals.\n\nThe buildings stand like tired sentinels. Some wear new faces inside their old bones. Down the way they've raised new apartments, built quick and cheap, charging gold for copper. A sin against honest architecture but they know the students will come. They always come.\n\nThere's a place serves food on paper plates. Microwave hum their constant prayer. Gas station across the way. Bad place to work they say. City money brought new concrete though. Wide sidewalks. Grass growing where there wasn't before. Nature tamed and parceled.\n\nTrees shelter my building like ancient guardians. Some fell to the saw, their stumps testament to their last stand. More trees here than down the road where the light hits harder. Behind us lies 43rd street, meaner somehow. Broken sidewalks like a mouthful of bad teeth. Buildings trying to hide their shame behind green curtains of leaves. Violence visits there more often, though it knows no boundaries. Crosses the street sometimes to where the wanderers live in their temporary homes.\n\nBut this place suits me well enough. Money flows easier here and the necessities of life stand close. The university and its promise remains within reach, and the buses come regular as heartbeats, carrying people to store and city alike. Some might call it home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all but rather houses strung along the curved road like beads on some great necklace. Folk here they know each other mostly. They gather in the gloaming at the end of drives not chosen but found and speak of things that matter little while their young ones mark the concrete with chalk or chase kites against the dimming sky. Like some forgotten time. Like the world aint gone mad with its screens and circuits and endless hum of progress.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees stand ancient witness while clouds white as bone drift across the blue vault above. But the weather it turns cruel sometimes. Last night the sirens wailed their banshee song and we all knew what it meant. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever precious things I could gather while the big one paced and barked at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles scattered across the earth. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cool, temperature falling like a stone from ninety-two to seventy-five. The ice melted where it struck leaving ghost marks on the pavement.\n\nThen the sun broke through and rain fell still and there appeared above us twin arcs of color like some covenant with the sky. Captured it with the camera though such things aint meant for keeping. People emerged slow from their shelters like creatures after flood, and life took up its rhythm again. Women calling children home to supper.\n\nThis place it speaks different from New Hampshire. Got its own tongue, soft and sweet as honey. The houses mirror each other outside but inside they're as different as the folk who dwell in them. Behind my place theres a field stretches down to a pond where no one swims and sometimes deer step quiet in the dawn while bullfrogs sing their ancient songs. Charlotte lies forty minutes distant but here the roosters still announce the morning and somewhere in the gathering dark a donkey brays his lonesome prayer. Like some village lost to time, found again in this corner of North Carolina. A place that still remembers what it means to be a place.",
            "Ten years now. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. First light of Stockbridge felt wrong after Riverdale, like wearing someone else's skin. Tears came unbidden. Mother and father, they wanted better. Better schools, better houses, better lives for their young. Away from what folk called the ghetto though such words mean little to children who know only home.\n\nTime passes like water through fingers. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange except for Glen and Dennis who lived adjacent. Good people. Family almost, if blood weren't the judge of such things. Remember Glen's wedding clear as yesterday's sun. Him getting married again, wife in white. Veda, they called her. She threw that white garter and somehow it found my hand though the flowers went elsewhere. We danced. All of us. Marsharii, Glen's daughter, she danced too. Ain't seen her since. World takes people where it will.\n\nThe streets here wind like serpents but technology guides now where feet once wandered blind. Kason and Curtis, we'd game together. Young men killing time like it was endless. The park became sanctuary. Something holy in the quiet there. Brought sticks from the hardware store, practice balance like them eastern warriors. Wooden sword too sometimes. Basketball court and tennis lanes lay empty now but memory serves up old games. Father and Mr. Graves teaching tennis, working us till sweat ran rivers. Joy in the work though. Always joy.\n\nNeighborhood holds stories like earth holds bones. Some rise up, others stay buried. But like them preachers say, best is yet to come. Though who can say what best means in a world that turns regardless of our wishes.",
            "The town dont stand apart from any other in South Carolina but it carries the weight of peaches on its back like some ancient burden. Johnston they call it. Peach Capital of the World emblazoned on a sign weathered and proud against the sky. The land stretches vast and empty save for the peach trees standing like sentinels in ordered rows or the black cattle that dot the fields like moving shadows.\n\nHouses stand apart from one another like strangers at a wake. Metal roofs gleam under the merciless southern sun or gray shingles fade like old memories. They squat back from the road behind fields where beasts graze and crops rise from the red earth. The town proper hangs suspended around a single stoplight, its red eye blinking at the crossroads where commerce gatheres like vultures at a carcass.\n\nThree places serve what passes for sustenance: the Chinese family at Hong Kong, their faces worn smooth like river stones, the Mexicans at their Fiesta, and Gary's where burgers slide across greased counters. The pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford, deals in medicines and cherry cola, each equally addictive to the locals. IGA stands alone, a grocery outpost charging siege prices while the townfolk flee to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville like refugees seeking sanctuary.\n\nDollar General rules this kingdom of small needs, its aisles always full, a bazaar of plastic and necessity. The furniture woman tends her store of possibilities like a garden, her two movers strong as oxen carrying couches across thresholds. Next door they wash dogs at Clark's, soap and water bringing order to chaos.\n\nThe doctors tend to man and beast in separate buildings on the outskirts, like some biblical separation. Children learn their letters at Johnston Elementary until fifth grade sends them away like young exiles to the next town over. They speak of parks to come, two and a half acres of manufactured pleasure, but for now the land remains raw and untamed.\n\nNo picture shows, no bowling alleys, no gathering places where youth might congregate like starlings on a wire. Just earth and sky and peach trees and cattle, a town so small you might pass through it between heartbeats, like a dream half-remembered in the morning light.",
            "We live where the asphalt runs between two highways in the southern part of Tennessee, the road black and endless and carrying the burden of too many strangers passing through. The houses stand like tired sentinels, their occupants long familiar to us now, their faces worn by time and weather and the daily rituals that bind them to this place. They move about their yards like penitents, raking leaves that fall eternal from ancient trees that stood here before any of us drew breath.\n\nThe house sits at the corner where we watch the world pass. Four souls dwell within. Me and the wife and two girls, eleven and fourteen, their youth still unmarked by time. We know the machines that pass, their engines humming familiar songs, and when strange metal beasts prowl our streets we mark them well, our eyes following their passage like wary predators.\n\nWinter brings children to the hill on the side street, their sleds cutting dark paths in virgin snow. But winters grow weak now, mere shadows of seasons past, and fall stretches long and dark across the calendar like a dying man's shadow. The mowers drone from spring until the dying time of October, their mechanical voices a chorus that echoes through the trees that crowd our lots like wooden armies.\n\nThe garage stands rear-ward, dark and waiting. When I work there the doors yawn open like great metal maws and I can taste the neighborhood on my tongue. Smell the smoke from burning leaves that marks the death of summer. Watch the barbecue smoke rise from back decks like signals from ancient tribes. Holiday times bring strange cars and foreign faces, metal and flesh crowding the streets like refugees from some distant war.\n\nWe rarely use the front door. It stands like a forgotten sentinel, its knock a rare herald of the outside world trying to breach our sanctuary. The traffic flows endless past our corner, a river of metal and exhaust that mars what might otherwise be perfect. But this is our place and we abide here, watching the seasons turn and the leaves fall and the children grow beneath these ancient trees that remember more than any of us ever will.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast brown altar, dirt and more dirt reaching toward mountains that stand ancient and indifferent. A man who ain't lived here don't know what it means to see nothing but brown, and when you spy a patch of grass you know that somebody's paying dear for such vanity. Back in the nineties the houses stood apart like scattered bones in the waste. Still do mostly, though new structures rise up now like teeth through flesh.\n\nThe place grows citified day by day but that's the way of all things now. Folk are friendly enough but like anywhere there's good and there's bad and there's those that don't know which they are. My patch is ringed with old folks, quiet and decent enough. The stores are all chains, Food for Less and Smart and Final standing like concrete sentinels. Ain't no fancy markets here. You want that kind of thing you got to travel.\n\nConstruction rules these parts. Men with hammers and steel raising frames against the sky. Too much empty space calling out to be filled though that thought carries its own kind of dread. Left the big city behind and ain't keen to see it follow me here. I'm in construction myself, hanging drywall and T-bar, my hands knowing the work like they know their own shape.\n\nThe animals though. That's what makes this place. They was here first and they know it. Desert creatures moving through their own world like they was reading from some ancient script. Lizards and bugs carrying on their own wars and treaties while we watch from our windows. My three young ones chase these creatures with the dedication of scientists, their small hands reaching out toward mystery.\n\nThe county fair comes round once a year like some traveling carnival of dreams. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like God's own frosting. Down below the Victor Valley Museum holds its bones and artifacts, telling stories of what was and what might have been. Native peoples left their mark here, their ghost stories still echoing across the waste. This high desert holds its secrets close, revealing them only to those patient enough to wait, to watch, to listen to what the wind's been trying to tell us all along.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete plain, dormitories rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. This here aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of. No white picket fences or cookie-cutter homes with manicured lawns. This here's my home all the same.\n\nThe buildings stand sentinel, three breeds of dwelling each with their own purpose ordained by some nameless architect long dead. The apartments squat low against the ground, two stories high and filled with the breath and movement of twenty souls give or take. Then there's the houses proper, scattered like dice across the grounds, mostly filled with them that used to walk these halls in years past. But it's the dormitories that tower above all else, great concrete beehives housing hundreds, each cell containing two bodies sharing the same air, same walls, same destiny.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds walking the same paths worn smooth by countless feet before them. The old ones, the professors and such, they keep to them houses dotted bout the grounds. The young ones, fresh-faced and raw, they fill them dormitories like cattle in pens. The ones in between, they take to them apartments like some middle ground between youth and wisdom.\n\nGot stores here too, though not like what you'd find in town proper. Places to eat, places to buy books and clothes with the school's mark on em like some tribal insignia. And there's this park, kept clean by some unspoken covenant between all them that call this place home. A green space where all kinds gather, where the borders between professor and student blur like heat waves rising off summer asphalt.\n\nThis here's my neighborhood, strange as it might seem to them living in proper towns. But it's got its own heartbeat, its own rules, its own way of being. And that's something true as sunrise.",
            "Aint no sidewalks here. The world slopes down and away like some great tilted plate and the house stands alone atop the highest rise where runners come daily to test themselves against the grade. They call it the workout hill. People walk in the road for there aint nowhere else to walk and the pavement is broke and scarred like the face of some ancient warrior. The wires hang slack between their poles, twisted and spliced and mended time and again by storms that rake the coast. Everywhere the evergreens rise up dark and brooding but folk here hate them, cut them down with a vengeance for blocking their view of the water. They build their houses tall with walls of glass that peer out across the bay like lidless eyes, each trying to outreach its neighbor.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns like molten copper but mostly the sky stays gray and the clouds hang low and everything that dont move grows a coat of green fur. Moss claims whatever it can. Left my truck sitting a month and found it transformed to something prehistoric and verdant. Three hours with a scraper to bring the metal back to light.\n\nThe old ones live here mostly. Retired folk. Where you might expect children you find dogs running loose and wild, pushing through open doors like they own the place. Found one in my parlor once, staring at me like I was the intruder. The rabbits too have claimed this land, great fat ones that dig up gardens until my cats find them. Birds wheel overhead - tiny things mostly, but sometimes an eagle riding the thermals until the crows drive it off like they was protecting their own piece of sky.\n\nDown the hill where the land meets the water there's places that serve up whatever the bay gives them that day. No proper beach but rocks enough to throw, watching them vanish into the gray water. The far shore sits like a dark wall through the mist, close enough to mock but too far to touch.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some sprawling beast in Brooklyn's belly, its streets a maze of concrete and steel that any fool with a metrocard could find. The trains come and go like metal serpents beneath the earth, carrying the masses in their steel bellies. Urban it was, yes, urban as any place could be in this city of endless windows and hard angles.\n\nThe Asians had come. Twenty years now they'd been coming, setting up their shops like territory markers, one after another after another until you couldn't walk a block without seeing their signs in characters that looked like birds taking flight. Markets and laundries mostly. Good places. Clean places. The people knew it too, knew the worth of fresh fish and vegetables that didn't cost a week's wages. Where I stood you could throw a stone and hit four such markets, though there wasn't any call to do such a thing.\n\nThe place wasn't all Asian though. It was a patchwork of souls, immigrants and their children and their children's children, all of them carrying their histories like invisible weights. The park stood renovated and gleaming, a testament to some bureaucrat's promise kept. Basketball courts stretched out like dominoes, soccer fields lay green and waiting, handball courts stood silent until the next game. Children's laughter echoed off the water fountains in summer, all colors and creeds mixing like watercolors in the rain.\n\nNo towers here. No glass monuments to corporate greed. Just homes stacked two deep, families living above families, and the occasional co-op rising like a concrete tombstone. The people were good enough but the noise lived in your bones. Cars would pass with their music bleeding through windows, engines screaming like wounded animals in the dark hours.\n\nNight brought its own rules. Safe enough they said but safety was a thin blanket that could tear. Violence lived here too, in the shadows between streetlights. Thieves took packages from doorsteps like coyotes stealing eggs from nests. Dogs left their marks on sidewalks despite the city's laws, their owners' negligence a testament to man's indifference to man. Every morning the evidence lay there, waiting for an unwary step, like little landmines of urban living.",
            "First thing about Portland Oregon is what weird means and you best understand that before anything else. There's words painted on the back wall of some establishment that serves pizza and music and flesh and liquor and maybe half of what goes on there aint strictly legal but the words say Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the darkness. Some folk say it's a remembrance of older times when the city was cheaper and stranger and bred peculiar tribes in its rainswept streets. Others hear it like a calling, like come to this place where your strangeness will be blessed instead of cursed.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their clean clothes and their condominium towers rise like concrete prophets against the grey sky but the weird abides. Not that weird means kind exactly but it means tolerant of things that most places would turn away. We got our Walmarts same as anywhere and our Chinese goods and our fights about politics but somehow it's different here. Like God took normal and twisted it sideways and that's what we got.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that would shame a sunset and gardens grow wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers mixing like old friends. And there's the free boxes. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass by in human form. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes stranger things. Magic things. Things that find the right person at the right time like they was meant to.\n\nThat's Portland to me though I'm just one kind of strange in an ocean of strange. Some folks wouldn't touch those sidewalk treasures with a ten foot pole but they'll do yoga with goats or scream themselves hoarse at soccer matches and that's their kind of weird. We're all chasing something here, dreams or ghosts or just the bottom of a whiskey glass.\n\nThe rain comes constant most months, grey and eternal as time itself, and it breeds darkness in some souls. We got our addicts and our crazy folk and our homeless camps spread out like refugee settlements from some war nobody remembers fighting. The city tries to help but help aint ever enough and the people who still got homes swing between charity and rage like a pendulum. In that we're just like anywhere else. Just normal folk trying to figure out what to do with all our broken pieces.",
            "They stand in the north like ancient gods. Bearing witness. Patient and cruel in their permanence. The mountains. No matter what tribulations of man pass beneath them they remain. Unmoved. Unchanged. When the mind grows weary with the tasks of living they command attention like some dark covenant writ in stone and earth and there is no choice but to look upon them and draw what strength remains in their presence.\n\nI came here young. A student. The university buildings stood ornate and proper but it was the mountains that held dominion over all. The town below stretched out like some dying creature, its cafes and shops the last breaths of civilization before the wild. Students haunted these places like restless ghosts, their minds clouded with coffee and desperation, seeking answers in books that held none. Further on lay the old downtown with its weathered brick facades. A false promise of urbanity. The library marked some invisible boundary between this pretense and the quiet beyond. As if god himself had drawn a line in chalk and dared not cross it.\n\nMemories collect in such places like detritus after a flood. Some precious, some bitter. The rusted playground equipment stands sentinel over countless midnight wanderings. The theater with its gaudy lights bears witness to brief moments of joy. But it is the ponds that hold the darkest hours. Where tears fall silent in the small hours while creatures crawl and swim about their meaningless lives, ignorant of human suffering. Standing there in those moments the question of purpose hangs heavy as a noose.\n\nWalking north past suburban houses that squat like toads in their perfect rows. The sun breaks over palm trees and paints the sky in colors that have no names. And there they stand. As they have always stood. As they will always stand. The mountains. Their peaks pierce the morning haze like knives and speak without speaking of endurance. Of persistence. Of the terrible burden of continuing on.",
            "You'd pass it by and think nothing of it. Nothing at all. Just another strip of commerce dying slow in the southern heat behind which people made their homes whether they ought to or not. Past the hollow shell of what was once a Whole Foods and beyond the hotels that stand near empty save summer's brief fever dream of reunions and gatherings, there they lived. Row on row of apartments lined up like children's toys forgotten in the dust. God's own dioramas of life and living.\n\nThe first block carried stories dark as pitch in the evening news but appearances deceive and truth hides in shadow. Beyond lay something else entirely. Something the townsfolk knew nothing of, cared nothing for. Across the way stood the college, squat and institutional, where students shuffled in bearing paper cups of coffee like votive offerings to some modernday deity of education. Iron gates keened their morning song while traffic built and drivers cursed the dawdling scholars before them.\n\nThe road met its end at another, a T-shaped communion of asphalt where the rehabilitation center faced down the park across the way. Ceiling fans turned lazy circles in the thick summer air while the broken and healing watched life pass by from rocking chairs. Children moved like wild things through the grass, their bodies describing geometries of youth while bees performed their ancient dance among the roadside flowers. The elderly walked their dogs and cast dark looks at boys on wheeled boards, nodding proper-like to clusters of girls who spoke in whispers of boys and digital fame.\n\nStrip mall life carried on beside them. A sushi place that time forgot. A pool supply store. Nail salon wedged between like an afterthought. Modern convenience stacked and ordered, everything at hand. The frozen yogurt place drew them in, those young ones with their boards and their vapor clouds, thinking themselves immortal in the weight of summer air. This was America distilled, the south preserved in amber, where time moved slow as molasses and change came gentle as a whisper, if it came at all.",
            "The houses stand like tired sentinels. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still in their weathered watch. Small plots of earth before them where dreams once grew green and verdant now lay fallow and forgotten. Driveways narrow and cracked lead to homes that whisper of times past when suburban living was the covenant of american prosperity. That dream now recedes like evening tide leaving behind only shells of what once was. Yet the neighborhood persists. It calls out with voice ancient and true to those who would listen that all is not lost, that some fragment of that dream yet lives in the hearts of those who remain.\n\nThe people walk more slowly now. Their eyes cast down at yards gone wild where once pride bloomed in careful rows. Cars still rest in drives, their metal skin oxidized and weeping. Children play in streets wide as salvation, their world bounded by the horizon of youth and innocence. The school rises from concrete like some primitive godhouse, ninety years of hopes and futures stored in its brick belly. Churches stand empty save for dust and memory while basketball rings sing metallic hymns to those who still worship there.\n\nEach house different yet bound in common suffering. The market, Super A, squats beneath a sun-bleached sign, run by Yemeni folk who stand apart in their solitude among the mostly black residents. Wide streets become impromptu fields where young boys play at football, scattering like starlings when cars approach. Old folk speak of times when names were known and faces familiar, their words carrying the weight of generations.\n\nWhere once stood a temple to eastern combat arts now stands a dispensary of modern medicines, hollywood dreams replaced by chemical comfort. The cinema remains, a refuge for the old who find solace in flickering shadows of better days, while young ones pass it by like mourners at a stranger's grave. The expressway runs past but does not touch this place, kept at bay by elders who saw in its concrete arteries the death of something precious and unnamed. They build new schools now and speak of mascots, as if such tokens might ward off the future that comes for them all, inexorable as night.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, its streets a twisted maze of commerce and dwelling places strewn about like bones scattered by some ancient beast. Buildings rise and fall in their purpose, some for living and some for trade, and none seeming to care much for the order of things. Eateries spring up like weeds after rain, and shops both corporate and small huddle together in the shadow of progress. The small ones, they persist somehow, clinging to life along the streets that wind past neighborhoods that aint never known true quiet, not with the world pressing in all around.\n\nParks dot the landscape like green wounds in the concrete, where children still play and their mothers watch with tired eyes. The people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. The queers and the Jews and the Russians all staked their claims, carved out their territories in this godless expanse. Further out lie the other tribes - the Koreans, the Chinese, the Armenians - each with their own small kingdoms in the urban waste, though none but ten miles distant as the crow flies.\n\nBut distance here is measured in time and suffering. Ten miles might mean two hours of your life, lost to the endless river of machines that choke the streets. Nobody walks. They cant. Or they wont. The city's too big, too mean for that. So the cars multiply like a plague and there aint nowhere to put them all. And still they build, raising towers of glass and steel to house more souls, more vehicles, more despair. The old residents watch and curse under their breath, knowing what's coming.\n\nHouses stand defiant against the apartment blocks, some big, some small, some split in two like conjoined twins. They all tell different stories of different lives, different dreams. The people living in them, they're strangers to each other now. Time was when children played in streets and knew their neighbors' names. Those days are gone, buried under the weight of progress and indifference, like so much else in this concrete wilderness.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stood like soldiers in endless formation clear to the horizon. This is what there is, he said. He knew the emptiness would strike her deep, her being from places where folk lived stacked upon folk and markets stood walking distance from any door. She'd never seen such vastness laid bare before her eyes.\n\nThe fields of corn stretched eternal and watching her face he told her tales of his youth in rural Ohio and she knew him then as she hadnt before. The road they followed, just two lanes of crumbling asphalt, led past a waterlogged quarry to where the houses stood. Brick and stucco dwellings each claiming its half acre of manicured earth, gardens tended with religious devotion. Spring brought forth flowers planted by careful hands while the native trees marked time's passage with their changing colors.\n\nMercedes automobiles gleamed in driveways like alien artifacts, their surfaces reflecting midday sun after ritual washing. The Korean, old doc they called him, could be found most days astride his green John Deere, singing above the machines drone while he cut patterns in the grass. Folk smiled at his ways but knew him for what he was - a good man with stories etched deep in his weathered face. Time had taken its toll on his mind but he persisted, a fixture like the trees themselves.\n\nThe house stood grey against the sky. Geese patrolled the yard while the terrier gave chase, an endless ritual neither side meant to conclude. Behind lay the stream that fed the quarry, its voice mixing with bullfrog song and distant cattle lowing across the fields. Past the wooden bridge they'd built by hand lay wilderness untamed - trees and herbs and flowers that grew by natures will alone. This was where childhood lived.\n\nWinter came harsh and beautiful both. The green world died to white emptiness, trees stripped to bone against grey skies. Snow transformed the land overnight into something foreign and pure. His sister's angels lay pressed in drifts while snowmen stood sentinel. They'd wage their wars then, him and his sister, behind fortifications of packed snow reinforced with dead branches. They'd launch their frozen projectiles in battles that meant everything and nothing, playing at war in a world where time hadnt yet shown its teeth."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland meets them tourist towns like old friends meetin at a crossroads. Ain't no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores with their bright lights and empty promises. Everything's a drive. Everything's a journey.\n\nThe water surrounds us like God's own embrace. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of em blue as judgment day. Everywhere you turn there's water waitin to baptize your feet in its cold mercy.\n\nThe houses stand like congregants at an old time revival, each one different, each one with its own history written in wood and nail and time. Some got new faces, some wear their age like medals. Most got these basements you can see from the road, like the earth opened up and swallowed part of em whole. The aluminum siding's gone gray and weary on many, weathered by seasons uncounted. Colors everywhere. Like God himself got drunk on paint one day and threw it all across the neighborhood.\n\nYards stretch out like promises. Kids' dreams scattered across em in the shape of trampolines and swing sets. Gardens grow where hope takes root. Fences mark the boundaries where folks keep their animals, keep their lives contained.\n\nThese are working people's homes. The kind of folk who wear their labor like skin and raise their young with calloused hands. Children run wild in the streets like scattered birds. Dogs walk their people. Bikes spin their wheels in the dying light. Neighbors know each other's shadows. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear.\n\nThe lawns stay trimmed like Sunday haircuts. No dead leaves permitted to rest. Everything maintained, everything in its place, like the order might keep chaos at bay. Ain't beautiful in the way fancy folks think of beautiful, but it's got something better. Got truth. Got peace.\n\nThe law sits close by, sheriff and jail both, like old testament prophets watching over their flock. The health department. The recycling center where folks bring their discarded dreams. Baseball fields echo with voices calling out names like prayers into the evening air. Small planes drone overhead like mechanical angels, coming and going from the airport that sits like a promise of escape.\n\nIce cream's within walking distance. Downtown too, if your legs got the faith. Kids can ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks of freedom stretched out before them. This here's a good place. A true place. The kind of place where America still dreams its old dreams and believes in em too.",
            "They built it all the same. Row after row of houses like children's blocks laid out by some vast and methodical hand. The HOA's presence hung over it all like a wraith, unseen but felt in every trimmed blade and painted shutter. Houses stood shoulder to shoulder, each with its measured plot of grass and scattered stone, driveways short as winter days. Trees grew where they were told, stunted things that gave no shade. Two-car garages lined up like grave markers.\n\nThe roads stretched out black and perfect, untouched by the violence of frost or neglect. No potholes marred the surface, as if decay itself had been legislated away. Most dwellings squatted low to the earth but some rose up two stories, reaching toward something they'd never grasp. The mailboxes stood in steel congregations at the street's end, uniform and cold, locked away from thieves and chaos. Package lockers gaped like empty mouths.\n\nThe neighborhood sat at the city's edge where civilization met wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land spread out vast and empty, punctuated by community pools behind their iron gates, walking trails that wound like asphalt serpents through the scrubland. Folk walked their dogs there or wandered alone in the gloaming. You could run till your legs gave out and never leave these borders.\n\nMostly it was the old ones who lived here. Retirees who'd come to die in peace, watching from behind their windows. Some younger souls mixed in, professionals with their briefcases and pressed shirts, but they were fewer. The city beyond sprawled large but carried itself like a small town, one mall standing sentinel over commerce. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to the stores - high-end markets with their organic promises, discount shops with their fluorescent desperation.\n\nIt was safe here. That's what they all said. Safe and maintained and proper. The pools gleamed blue in summer sun, the trails stretched out empty and waiting. Everything a body could want, they said, just a short drive away. But at night, when the sun bled out behind the identical rooflines, something else stirred in the spaces between the sameness, something that remembered what this land had been before the concrete came.",
            "First I heard tell of this place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through wire and static like old ghosts. Strange thing. The units here they cost dear, thousand dollars or more each month gone to wind and nobody I knew had heard such tales. Maybe its the weight of living bears down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper, friends trying to hold together what little they got. We learned to scrape by. Years teach you to love the smell of other peoples castoffs, the musty sweetness of old toys and clothes wrapped in paper, mothballs like little white deaths. Your nose forgets in time. Maybe its the cigarettes or maybe the world just wears you down till you dont notice no more. But that fleamarket smell it gets in deep. Adulthood smells like magazines gone yellow stacked on piano keys nobody plays no more. Gets in the leather and wont wash out.\n\nThree secondhand stores walking distance. Start at the far end you can hit two charity shops, library with its paper smell, man selling rare books, shop full of curiosities. Downtown packed tight with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like water but step inside them shops and the world goes quiet as a grave. Good place to lose yourself. Every year more comes, more metal more flesh. They call it developing. Some big internet empire made its home here, growing pains they say. Makes me think on New York. Everybody got their own heading, nobody asks nothing of nobody. You can keep to yourself, quiet-like, independent, and folks let you be. Aint like down South where caring means getting in folks business. Here you stay in your shell long as you want and the city just rolls past like the ocean we got.\n\nPlace stays alive though. Got piano player next door, two trying to be singers up above. Less strangers more like family now. We come together when needs must, mark the birthdays and the funerals, help each other best we can. Lucky maybe. Like my neighbors well enough and they treat me fair. I mind my mess and share my food, they do the same. Pass mail back and forth like peace offerings. Good to see them and reckon they feel same about me. Living in this big cold machine of glass and steel but its them makes me think I aint ruined nothing after all.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something else entirely. Our quarter sits on the eastern edge where the houses stand weathered and bent like old men waiting. Not rich folk here. Most rent. Some own but all scratch out their days in dwellings worth less than the memories they hold.\n\nThe people here they nod and speak when you pass. Good people mostly. Violence visits sometimes like an unwelcome relative that won't stay gone. Shots ring out in the night. Bodies fall. The neighbors boy went down outside MacGruder's Bar last spring. Just went down and didn't get up again. We've been lucky. Lost nothing save what we were foolish enough to leave on the porch come nightfall.\n\nThe poison that's taken half the country hasn't spared us neither. Fentanyl's got its hooks in deep. Bodies stack up like cordwood in winter. Town's got places for them that want help. Training for them that want to save someone. Sometimes it works. Mostly it don't.\n\nYet there's good here too. The school where my boy goes stands like a fortress against the darkness. Teachers there treat him right despite his differences. No meanness follows him through those halls. The women of the PTO work like ants building community one event at a time. Every child eats free cause hunger don't care what side of town you're from.\n\nThe council men they pour money into the center of town like water into sand. New roads. Parks with fresh paint. Gardens where weeds once stood. But the east side sees none of it. Money flows west where the shoppers go and the cars pass through. East side folks watch and wait and talk about injustice in low voices.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house ain't much but it holds us. Keeps the rain out. Keeps us warm. Stores sell what we need. People know us. Sometimes at night I think about leaving but I know we won't. Some places get in your blood like a fever and won't let go. This is such a place.",
            "The hill rises like some ancient altar, crowned with buildings that remember. Seven stories up I dwell, the old theater watching silent across the way, and down below there's this place where folk gather when the summer heat bleeds into night, a bar with machines that ping and flash and draw the masses like moths to flame. They queue there, patient in the thick June air, July air, waiting for their turn at whatever salvation lies within.\n\nUphill the park sprawls vast and concrete-bound, its steps cut deep into walls that hold no memory. Winter brings the dispossessed, their canvas homes lined like soldiers' graves along the walks and stairs. Rain comes more than snow, brutal and cold, driving them together for warmth in the city's heart rather than out where the wild things grow. They walk or ride to wash where they can, the family center standing lone sentinel in miles of urban waste.\n\nBut it aint the old buildings that make this place, though they stand proud enough, scattered cross the hills that tumble oceanward. It's the people carry the real history here. Hilltop, they called it, when blood ran in gutters and gang wars painted these streets red. Federal men came through like God's own wrath, DEA badges glinting like false stars. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like me who came after.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though others still name it rough country. White folk, they say, best clear out after dark. But that's old poison talking, the kind that seeps through generations like bad water through limestone. Maybe it's my skin, dark enough to pass, or maybe Hilltop sees what's truly in a soul. These streets know the weight of racism, know how fear breeds in ignorance like rats in walls, even here in this supposed melting pot paradise.\n\nThis much I know true: Hilltop's got my bones now. These night streets pulse with life, and strangers offer warmth before threat. Laundry women keep doors open past closing just to shelter a charging phone, and concrete storefronts become sanctuaries. Even when I try to fade into shadow, someone always sees. They press wrinkled bills into palms and speak of beauty and worth like prophets of some new religion. This is home, and it holds its own terrible grace.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade, the houses standing like sentinels in the gathering dusk. Strange and lonesome at first until I found kinship with two boys who lived along that same stretch of asphalt. They're gone now but the memories remain like shadows cast by a setting sun. The old neighbors persist, their faces weathered by time but unchanged in their routines.\n\nThe houses rise two stories tall, cookie-cutter monuments to suburban dreams. Children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and perfectly trimmed hedges. Most days the quiet settles like dust. The people here keep to themselves except in times of need, a silent covenant between strangers sharing the same patch of earth. Packages appear and remain untouched on porches, a testament to some lingering trust in human nature.\n\nThe park lies just beyond, a small stretch of green where memories collect like fallen leaves. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked courts where we played our games, the concrete holding stories of triumph and blood. One day my nose burst red against someone's elbow in a football game, but such wounds heal and good memories outweigh the bad like light outweighs shadow. Now I watch my cousin's children chase their own joy there, their small bodies arcing through space on swing sets, their excitement pure and uncontained.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within walking distance. Though nowadays people summon their meals through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints stand on every corner like modern-day trading posts. The stores stock everything a body might need, from medicine to groceries to spices from the old country. Even got an Indian market where the air hangs heavy with cardamom and cumin.\n\nI've come to know this place like the back of my hand, grateful for its quiet dignity when I read tales of neighborhood wars and porch pirates in other places. Some folks don't know how good they got it till they see how bad it could be.",
            "The college stands near where I lay my head. Not far. Walking distance. Buildings rise up like concrete monoliths, weathered and old, their faces worn by time and indifference. Bars and eateries dot the streets between, some cheaper than others, some renamed in vain attempts at reinvention. The new one charges more but the spirits flow just the same.\n\nPeople here exist in two tribes: the students with their books and dreams, and the poor with their burdens. Children too, countless, drawn by the elementary school that squats beyond the asphalt. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how it'll stay. They fill the halls with sweet smoke and management's response was to mount some perfumed contraption across their door. A joke told in plastic and chemicals.\n\nThe buildings stand like tired sentinels. Some wear new faces inside their old bones. Down the way they've raised new apartments, built quick and cheap, charging gold for copper. A sin against honest architecture but they know the students will come. They always come.\n\nThere's a place serves food on paper plates. Microwave hum their constant prayer. Gas station across the way. Bad place to work they say. City money brought new concrete though. Wide sidewalks. Grass growing where there wasn't before. Nature tamed and parceled.\n\nTrees shelter my building like ancient guardians. Some fell to the saw, their stumps testament to their last stand. More trees here than down the road where the light hits harder. Behind us lies 43rd street, meaner somehow. Broken sidewalks like a mouthful of bad teeth. Buildings trying to hide their shame behind green curtains of leaves. Violence visits there more often, though it knows no boundaries. Crosses the street sometimes to where the wanderers live in their temporary homes.\n\nBut this place suits me well enough. Money flows easier here and the necessities of life stand close. The university and its promise remains within reach, and the buses come regular as heartbeats, carrying people to store and city alike. Some might call it home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all but rather houses strung along the curved road like beads on some great necklace. Folk here they know each other mostly. They gather in the gloaming at the end of drives not chosen but found and speak of things that matter little while their young ones mark the concrete with chalk or chase kites against the dimming sky. Like some forgotten time. Like the world aint gone mad with its screens and circuits and endless hum of progress.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees stand ancient witness while clouds white as bone drift across the blue vault above. But the weather it turns cruel sometimes. Last night the sirens wailed their banshee song and we all knew what it meant. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever precious things I could gather while the big one paced and barked at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles scattered across the earth. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cool, temperature falling like a stone from ninety-two to seventy-five. The ice melted where it struck leaving ghost marks on the pavement.\n\nThen the sun broke through and rain fell still and there appeared above us twin arcs of color like some covenant with the sky. Captured it with the camera though such things aint meant for keeping. People emerged slow from their shelters like creatures after flood, and life took up its rhythm again. Women calling children home to supper.\n\nThis place it speaks different from New Hampshire. Got its own tongue, soft and sweet as honey. The houses mirror each other outside but inside they're as different as the folk who dwell in them. Behind my place theres a field stretches down to a pond where no one swims and sometimes deer step quiet in the dawn while bullfrogs sing their ancient songs. Charlotte lies forty minutes distant but here the roosters still announce the morning and somewhere in the gathering dark a donkey brays his lonesome prayer. Like some village lost to time, found again in this corner of North Carolina. A place that still remembers what it means to be a place.",
            "Ten years now. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. First light of Stockbridge felt wrong after Riverdale, like wearing someone else's skin. Tears came unbidden. Mother and father, they wanted better. Better schools, better houses, better lives for their young. Away from what folk called the ghetto though such words mean little to children who know only home.\n\nTime passes like water through fingers. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange except for Glen and Dennis who lived adjacent. Good people. Family almost, if blood weren't the judge of such things. Remember Glen's wedding clear as yesterday's sun. Him getting married again, wife in white. Veda, they called her. She threw that white garter and somehow it found my hand though the flowers went elsewhere. We danced. All of us. Marsharii, Glen's daughter, she danced too. Ain't seen her since. World takes people where it will.\n\nThe streets here wind like serpents but technology guides now where feet once wandered blind. Kason and Curtis, we'd game together. Young men killing time like it was endless. The park became sanctuary. Something holy in the quiet there. Brought sticks from the hardware store, practice balance like them eastern warriors. Wooden sword too sometimes. Basketball court and tennis lanes lay empty now but memory serves up old games. Father and Mr. Graves teaching tennis, working us till sweat ran rivers. Joy in the work though. Always joy.\n\nNeighborhood holds stories like earth holds bones. Some rise up, others stay buried. But like them preachers say, best is yet to come. Though who can say what best means in a world that turns regardless of our wishes.",
            "The town dont stand apart from any other in South Carolina but it carries the weight of peaches on its back like some ancient burden. Johnston they call it. Peach Capital of the World emblazoned on a sign weathered and proud against the sky. The land stretches vast and empty save for the peach trees standing like sentinels in ordered rows or the black cattle that dot the fields like moving shadows.\n\nHouses stand apart from one another like strangers at a wake. Metal roofs gleam under the merciless southern sun or gray shingles fade like old memories. They squat back from the road behind fields where beasts graze and crops rise from the red earth. The town proper hangs suspended around a single stoplight, its red eye blinking at the crossroads where commerce gatheres like vultures at a carcass.\n\nThree places serve what passes for sustenance: the Chinese family at Hong Kong, their faces worn smooth like river stones, the Mexicans at their Fiesta, and Gary's where burgers slide across greased counters. The pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford, deals in medicines and cherry cola, each equally addictive to the locals. IGA stands alone, a grocery outpost charging siege prices while the townfolk flee to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville like refugees seeking sanctuary.\n\nDollar General rules this kingdom of small needs, its aisles always full, a bazaar of plastic and necessity. The furniture woman tends her store of possibilities like a garden, her two movers strong as oxen carrying couches across thresholds. Next door they wash dogs at Clark's, soap and water bringing order to chaos.\n\nThe doctors tend to man and beast in separate buildings on the outskirts, like some biblical separation. Children learn their letters at Johnston Elementary until fifth grade sends them away like young exiles to the next town over. They speak of parks to come, two and a half acres of manufactured pleasure, but for now the land remains raw and untamed.\n\nNo picture shows, no bowling alleys, no gathering places where youth might congregate like starlings on a wire. Just earth and sky and peach trees and cattle, a town so small you might pass through it between heartbeats, like a dream half-remembered in the morning light.",
            "We live where the asphalt runs between two highways in the southern part of Tennessee, the road black and endless and carrying the burden of too many strangers passing through. The houses stand like tired sentinels, their occupants long familiar to us now, their faces worn by time and weather and the daily rituals that bind them to this place. They move about their yards like penitents, raking leaves that fall eternal from ancient trees that stood here before any of us drew breath.\n\nThe house sits at the corner where we watch the world pass. Four souls dwell within. Me and the wife and two girls, eleven and fourteen, their youth still unmarked by time. We know the machines that pass, their engines humming familiar songs, and when strange metal beasts prowl our streets we mark them well, our eyes following their passage like wary predators.\n\nWinter brings children to the hill on the side street, their sleds cutting dark paths in virgin snow. But winters grow weak now, mere shadows of seasons past, and fall stretches long and dark across the calendar like a dying man's shadow. The mowers drone from spring until the dying time of October, their mechanical voices a chorus that echoes through the trees that crowd our lots like wooden armies.\n\nThe garage stands rear-ward, dark and waiting. When I work there the doors yawn open like great metal maws and I can taste the neighborhood on my tongue. Smell the smoke from burning leaves that marks the death of summer. Watch the barbecue smoke rise from back decks like signals from ancient tribes. Holiday times bring strange cars and foreign faces, metal and flesh crowding the streets like refugees from some distant war.\n\nWe rarely use the front door. It stands like a forgotten sentinel, its knock a rare herald of the outside world trying to breach our sanctuary. The traffic flows endless past our corner, a river of metal and exhaust that mars what might otherwise be perfect. But this is our place and we abide here, watching the seasons turn and the leaves fall and the children grow beneath these ancient trees that remember more than any of us ever will.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast brown altar, dirt and more dirt reaching toward mountains that stand ancient and indifferent. A man who ain't lived here don't know what it means to see nothing but brown, and when you spy a patch of grass you know that somebody's paying dear for such vanity. Back in the nineties the houses stood apart like scattered bones in the waste. Still do mostly, though new structures rise up now like teeth through flesh.\n\nThe place grows citified day by day but that's the way of all things now. Folk are friendly enough but like anywhere there's good and there's bad and there's those that don't know which they are. My patch is ringed with old folks, quiet and decent enough. The stores are all chains, Food for Less and Smart and Final standing like concrete sentinels. Ain't no fancy markets here. You want that kind of thing you got to travel.\n\nConstruction rules these parts. Men with hammers and steel raising frames against the sky. Too much empty space calling out to be filled though that thought carries its own kind of dread. Left the big city behind and ain't keen to see it follow me here. I'm in construction myself, hanging drywall and T-bar, my hands knowing the work like they know their own shape.\n\nThe animals though. That's what makes this place. They was here first and they know it. Desert creatures moving through their own world like they was reading from some ancient script. Lizards and bugs carrying on their own wars and treaties while we watch from our windows. My three young ones chase these creatures with the dedication of scientists, their small hands reaching out toward mystery.\n\nThe county fair comes round once a year like some traveling carnival of dreams. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like God's own frosting. Down below the Victor Valley Museum holds its bones and artifacts, telling stories of what was and what might have been. Native peoples left their mark here, their ghost stories still echoing across the waste. This high desert holds its secrets close, revealing them only to those patient enough to wait, to watch, to listen to what the wind's been trying to tell us all along.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete plain, dormitories rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. This here aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of. No white picket fences or cookie-cutter homes with manicured lawns. This here's my home all the same.\n\nThe buildings stand sentinel, three breeds of dwelling each with their own purpose ordained by some nameless architect long dead. The apartments squat low against the ground, two stories high and filled with the breath and movement of twenty souls give or take. Then there's the houses proper, scattered like dice across the grounds, mostly filled with them that used to walk these halls in years past. But it's the dormitories that tower above all else, great concrete beehives housing hundreds, each cell containing two bodies sharing the same air, same walls, same destiny.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds walking the same paths worn smooth by countless feet before them. The old ones, the professors and such, they keep to them houses dotted bout the grounds. The young ones, fresh-faced and raw, they fill them dormitories like cattle in pens. The ones in between, they take to them apartments like some middle ground between youth and wisdom.\n\nGot stores here too, though not like what you'd find in town proper. Places to eat, places to buy books and clothes with the school's mark on em like some tribal insignia. And there's this park, kept clean by some unspoken covenant between all them that call this place home. A green space where all kinds gather, where the borders between professor and student blur like heat waves rising off summer asphalt.\n\nThis here's my neighborhood, strange as it might seem to them living in proper towns. But it's got its own heartbeat, its own rules, its own way of being. And that's something true as sunrise.",
            "Aint no sidewalks here. The world slopes down and away like some great tilted plate and the house stands alone atop the highest rise where runners come daily to test themselves against the grade. They call it the workout hill. People walk in the road for there aint nowhere else to walk and the pavement is broke and scarred like the face of some ancient warrior. The wires hang slack between their poles, twisted and spliced and mended time and again by storms that rake the coast. Everywhere the evergreens rise up dark and brooding but folk here hate them, cut them down with a vengeance for blocking their view of the water. They build their houses tall with walls of glass that peer out across the bay like lidless eyes, each trying to outreach its neighbor.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns like molten copper but mostly the sky stays gray and the clouds hang low and everything that dont move grows a coat of green fur. Moss claims whatever it can. Left my truck sitting a month and found it transformed to something prehistoric and verdant. Three hours with a scraper to bring the metal back to light.\n\nThe old ones live here mostly. Retired folk. Where you might expect children you find dogs running loose and wild, pushing through open doors like they own the place. Found one in my parlor once, staring at me like I was the intruder. The rabbits too have claimed this land, great fat ones that dig up gardens until my cats find them. Birds wheel overhead - tiny things mostly, but sometimes an eagle riding the thermals until the crows drive it off like they was protecting their own piece of sky.\n\nDown the hill where the land meets the water there's places that serve up whatever the bay gives them that day. No proper beach but rocks enough to throw, watching them vanish into the gray water. The far shore sits like a dark wall through the mist, close enough to mock but too far to touch.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some sprawling beast in Brooklyn's belly, its streets a maze of concrete and steel that any fool with a metrocard could find. The trains come and go like metal serpents beneath the earth, carrying the masses in their steel bellies. Urban it was, yes, urban as any place could be in this city of endless windows and hard angles.\n\nThe Asians had come. Twenty years now they'd been coming, setting up their shops like territory markers, one after another after another until you couldn't walk a block without seeing their signs in characters that looked like birds taking flight. Markets and laundries mostly. Good places. Clean places. The people knew it too, knew the worth of fresh fish and vegetables that didn't cost a week's wages. Where I stood you could throw a stone and hit four such markets, though there wasn't any call to do such a thing.\n\nThe place wasn't all Asian though. It was a patchwork of souls, immigrants and their children and their children's children, all of them carrying their histories like invisible weights. The park stood renovated and gleaming, a testament to some bureaucrat's promise kept. Basketball courts stretched out like dominoes, soccer fields lay green and waiting, handball courts stood silent until the next game. Children's laughter echoed off the water fountains in summer, all colors and creeds mixing like watercolors in the rain.\n\nNo towers here. No glass monuments to corporate greed. Just homes stacked two deep, families living above families, and the occasional co-op rising like a concrete tombstone. The people were good enough but the noise lived in your bones. Cars would pass with their music bleeding through windows, engines screaming like wounded animals in the dark hours.\n\nNight brought its own rules. Safe enough they said but safety was a thin blanket that could tear. Violence lived here too, in the shadows between streetlights. Thieves took packages from doorsteps like coyotes stealing eggs from nests. Dogs left their marks on sidewalks despite the city's laws, their owners' negligence a testament to man's indifference to man. Every morning the evidence lay there, waiting for an unwary step, like little landmines of urban living.",
            "First thing about Portland Oregon is what weird means and you best understand that before anything else. There's words painted on the back wall of some establishment that serves pizza and music and flesh and liquor and maybe half of what goes on there aint strictly legal but the words say Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the darkness. Some folk say it's a remembrance of older times when the city was cheaper and stranger and bred peculiar tribes in its rainswept streets. Others hear it like a calling, like come to this place where your strangeness will be blessed instead of cursed.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their clean clothes and their condominium towers rise like concrete prophets against the grey sky but the weird abides. Not that weird means kind exactly but it means tolerant of things that most places would turn away. We got our Walmarts same as anywhere and our Chinese goods and our fights about politics but somehow it's different here. Like God took normal and twisted it sideways and that's what we got.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that would shame a sunset and gardens grow wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers mixing like old friends. And there's the free boxes. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass by in human form. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes stranger things. Magic things. Things that find the right person at the right time like they was meant to.\n\nThat's Portland to me though I'm just one kind of strange in an ocean of strange. Some folks wouldn't touch those sidewalk treasures with a ten foot pole but they'll do yoga with goats or scream themselves hoarse at soccer matches and that's their kind of weird. We're all chasing something here, dreams or ghosts or just the bottom of a whiskey glass.\n\nThe rain comes constant most months, grey and eternal as time itself, and it breeds darkness in some souls. We got our addicts and our crazy folk and our homeless camps spread out like refugee settlements from some war nobody remembers fighting. The city tries to help but help aint ever enough and the people who still got homes swing between charity and rage like a pendulum. In that we're just like anywhere else. Just normal folk trying to figure out what to do with all our broken pieces.",
            "They stand in the north like ancient gods. Bearing witness. Patient and cruel in their permanence. The mountains. No matter what tribulations of man pass beneath them they remain. Unmoved. Unchanged. When the mind grows weary with the tasks of living they command attention like some dark covenant writ in stone and earth and there is no choice but to look upon them and draw what strength remains in their presence.\n\nI came here young. A student. The university buildings stood ornate and proper but it was the mountains that held dominion over all. The town below stretched out like some dying creature, its cafes and shops the last breaths of civilization before the wild. Students haunted these places like restless ghosts, their minds clouded with coffee and desperation, seeking answers in books that held none. Further on lay the old downtown with its weathered brick facades. A false promise of urbanity. The library marked some invisible boundary between this pretense and the quiet beyond. As if god himself had drawn a line in chalk and dared not cross it.\n\nMemories collect in such places like detritus after a flood. Some precious, some bitter. The rusted playground equipment stands sentinel over countless midnight wanderings. The theater with its gaudy lights bears witness to brief moments of joy. But it is the ponds that hold the darkest hours. Where tears fall silent in the small hours while creatures crawl and swim about their meaningless lives, ignorant of human suffering. Standing there in those moments the question of purpose hangs heavy as a noose.\n\nWalking north past suburban houses that squat like toads in their perfect rows. The sun breaks over palm trees and paints the sky in colors that have no names. And there they stand. As they have always stood. As they will always stand. The mountains. Their peaks pierce the morning haze like knives and speak without speaking of endurance. Of persistence. Of the terrible burden of continuing on.",
            "You'd pass it by and think nothing of it. Nothing at all. Just another strip of commerce dying slow in the southern heat behind which people made their homes whether they ought to or not. Past the hollow shell of what was once a Whole Foods and beyond the hotels that stand near empty save summer's brief fever dream of reunions and gatherings, there they lived. Row on row of apartments lined up like children's toys forgotten in the dust. God's own dioramas of life and living.\n\nThe first block carried stories dark as pitch in the evening news but appearances deceive and truth hides in shadow. Beyond lay something else entirely. Something the townsfolk knew nothing of, cared nothing for. Across the way stood the college, squat and institutional, where students shuffled in bearing paper cups of coffee like votive offerings to some modernday deity of education. Iron gates keened their morning song while traffic built and drivers cursed the dawdling scholars before them.\n\nThe road met its end at another, a T-shaped communion of asphalt where the rehabilitation center faced down the park across the way. Ceiling fans turned lazy circles in the thick summer air while the broken and healing watched life pass by from rocking chairs. Children moved like wild things through the grass, their bodies describing geometries of youth while bees performed their ancient dance among the roadside flowers. The elderly walked their dogs and cast dark looks at boys on wheeled boards, nodding proper-like to clusters of girls who spoke in whispers of boys and digital fame.\n\nStrip mall life carried on beside them. A sushi place that time forgot. A pool supply store. Nail salon wedged between like an afterthought. Modern convenience stacked and ordered, everything at hand. The frozen yogurt place drew them in, those young ones with their boards and their vapor clouds, thinking themselves immortal in the weight of summer air. This was America distilled, the south preserved in amber, where time moved slow as molasses and change came gentle as a whisper, if it came at all.",
            "The houses stand like tired sentinels. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still in their weathered watch. Small plots of earth before them where dreams once grew green and verdant now lay fallow and forgotten. Driveways narrow and cracked lead to homes that whisper of times past when suburban living was the covenant of american prosperity. That dream now recedes like evening tide leaving behind only shells of what once was. Yet the neighborhood persists. It calls out with voice ancient and true to those who would listen that all is not lost, that some fragment of that dream yet lives in the hearts of those who remain.\n\nThe people walk more slowly now. Their eyes cast down at yards gone wild where once pride bloomed in careful rows. Cars still rest in drives, their metal skin oxidized and weeping. Children play in streets wide as salvation, their world bounded by the horizon of youth and innocence. The school rises from concrete like some primitive godhouse, ninety years of hopes and futures stored in its brick belly. Churches stand empty save for dust and memory while basketball rings sing metallic hymns to those who still worship there.\n\nEach house different yet bound in common suffering. The market, Super A, squats beneath a sun-bleached sign, run by Yemeni folk who stand apart in their solitude among the mostly black residents. Wide streets become impromptu fields where young boys play at football, scattering like starlings when cars approach. Old folk speak of times when names were known and faces familiar, their words carrying the weight of generations.\n\nWhere once stood a temple to eastern combat arts now stands a dispensary of modern medicines, hollywood dreams replaced by chemical comfort. The cinema remains, a refuge for the old who find solace in flickering shadows of better days, while young ones pass it by like mourners at a stranger's grave. The expressway runs past but does not touch this place, kept at bay by elders who saw in its concrete arteries the death of something precious and unnamed. They build new schools now and speak of mascots, as if such tokens might ward off the future that comes for them all, inexorable as night.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, its streets a twisted maze of commerce and dwelling places strewn about like bones scattered by some ancient beast. Buildings rise and fall in their purpose, some for living and some for trade, and none seeming to care much for the order of things. Eateries spring up like weeds after rain, and shops both corporate and small huddle together in the shadow of progress. The small ones, they persist somehow, clinging to life along the streets that wind past neighborhoods that aint never known true quiet, not with the world pressing in all around.\n\nParks dot the landscape like green wounds in the concrete, where children still play and their mothers watch with tired eyes. The people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. The queers and the Jews and the Russians all staked their claims, carved out their territories in this godless expanse. Further out lie the other tribes - the Koreans, the Chinese, the Armenians - each with their own small kingdoms in the urban waste, though none but ten miles distant as the crow flies.\n\nBut distance here is measured in time and suffering. Ten miles might mean two hours of your life, lost to the endless river of machines that choke the streets. Nobody walks. They cant. Or they wont. The city's too big, too mean for that. So the cars multiply like a plague and there aint nowhere to put them all. And still they build, raising towers of glass and steel to house more souls, more vehicles, more despair. The old residents watch and curse under their breath, knowing what's coming.\n\nHouses stand defiant against the apartment blocks, some big, some small, some split in two like conjoined twins. They all tell different stories of different lives, different dreams. The people living in them, they're strangers to each other now. Time was when children played in streets and knew their neighbors' names. Those days are gone, buried under the weight of progress and indifference, like so much else in this concrete wilderness.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stood like soldiers in endless formation clear to the horizon. This is what there is, he said. He knew the emptiness would strike her deep, her being from places where folk lived stacked upon folk and markets stood walking distance from any door. She'd never seen such vastness laid bare before her eyes.\n\nThe fields of corn stretched eternal and watching her face he told her tales of his youth in rural Ohio and she knew him then as she hadnt before. The road they followed, just two lanes of crumbling asphalt, led past a waterlogged quarry to where the houses stood. Brick and stucco dwellings each claiming its half acre of manicured earth, gardens tended with religious devotion. Spring brought forth flowers planted by careful hands while the native trees marked time's passage with their changing colors.\n\nMercedes automobiles gleamed in driveways like alien artifacts, their surfaces reflecting midday sun after ritual washing. The Korean, old doc they called him, could be found most days astride his green John Deere, singing above the machines drone while he cut patterns in the grass. Folk smiled at his ways but knew him for what he was - a good man with stories etched deep in his weathered face. Time had taken its toll on his mind but he persisted, a fixture like the trees themselves.\n\nThe house stood grey against the sky. Geese patrolled the yard while the terrier gave chase, an endless ritual neither side meant to conclude. Behind lay the stream that fed the quarry, its voice mixing with bullfrog song and distant cattle lowing across the fields. Past the wooden bridge they'd built by hand lay wilderness untamed - trees and herbs and flowers that grew by natures will alone. This was where childhood lived.\n\nWinter came harsh and beautiful both. The green world died to white emptiness, trees stripped to bone against grey skies. Snow transformed the land overnight into something foreign and pure. His sister's angels lay pressed in drifts while snowmen stood sentinel. They'd wage their wars then, him and his sister, behind fortifications of packed snow reinforced with dead branches. They'd launch their frozen projectiles in battles that meant everything and nothing, playing at war in a world where time hadnt yet shown its teeth."
