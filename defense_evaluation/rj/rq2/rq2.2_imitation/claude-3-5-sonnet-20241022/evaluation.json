            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland stretches out like some ancient quilt til it meets them tourist towns that sprout up like weeds after rain. Aint no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores with their bright lights calling like sirens. Everything's scattered and far, requiring wheels and gasoline and time.\n\nThe water surrounds us like God's own embrace. Lake Michigan vast and terrible to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them ancient and cold and blue as judgment. Everywhere you turn there's water waiting to swallow your feet, beaches stretched out like promises.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old men at a funeral. Each one different, each one carrying its years like scars. Some got new paint and windows gleaming like fresh eyes, others wear their age in peeling aluminum siding and weathered wood. Most got basements you can see from the street, concrete tombs sunk into the earth like buried secrets.\n\nThe yards spread wide and wild. Trampolines stand like metal mushrooms, swing sets rust in the rain. Gardens grow where folks put them, and fences hold dogs that bark at shadows. These houses speak of work and sweat and mortgage payments. They speak of children grown and children growing.\n\nKids run these streets like wild horses, their voices carrying on the wind. People walking dogs nod to neighbors they know by name and blood and time. The grass gets cut cause that's what's done. The bushes get trimmed cause that's what's expected. Ain't beautiful like them magazines show, but it's real and it's home and it's safe.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, all concrete and steel, and the planes from the small airport tear the sky like paper. Baseball games echo through the evening air, announcer's voice carrying like scripture across the diamond. Ice cream shop's walking distance if your legs'll carry you, and downtown ain't but a dream away.\n\nThis here's where life happens. Where children ride bikes through twilight and folks still wave from porches. Where the world ain't perfect but it's good enough. Where we all end up at day's end, coming home to roost like birds to the wire, knowing this is where we belong.",
            "The houses stand like sentinels in their measured plots, uniform and unyielding to time or circumstance, governed by some unseen authority that commands their conformity. They'd laid the homes out in perfect rows, each yard a mirror of its neighbor with strips of manicured grass and stones placed just so, as if some great hand had scattered them with deliberate indifference. The driveways, short and severe, lead to twin-door garages where vehicles sleep in climate-controlled darkness.\n\nThe concrete beneath lies pristine and unmarked, as if the very earth had been forbidden to crack or heave against man's dominion. No mailboxes stand guard at the roadside like in times past. Instead they'd gathered them in metallic colonies at the street's end, all locked away behind cold steel doors that yield only to their appointed keys.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out toward the city's edge where civilization gives way to something older and less ordered. Here the land spreads vast and accommodating, dotted with swimming pools enclosed by iron fences and threading paths that wind through stands of trees like veins in some great living thing. The retired folk who'd made this place their sanctuary move about in measured steps, watching, nodding, keeping their silent vigil over the younger ones who'd come to dwell among them.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own peculiar heartbeat, neither fully urban nor truly rural, holding within its bounds a single mall that serves as some modern-day gathering place. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction leads to commerce of every stripe - stores stocked floor to ceiling with organic produce and wholesome things, while others stand sparse and stripped down to bare essentials, each serving its purpose in the greater scheme of things.\n\nHere in this manufactured eden, everything has its place and purpose. The pools shimmer blue and chlorinated under the sun, the trails wind their predetermined course, and the houses stand in their perfect rows, all of it maintained by some invisible hand that brooks no deviation from its prescribed order. A place where safety is not just promised but delivered, where the inhabitants move through their days in a dance of practiced contentment, fifteen minutes away from whatever modern convenience their hearts might desire.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through some voices speaking of the vanished and the dead, crackling through wire and static like spirits trapped in the machine. Strange thing to hear. All them units going for north of a thousand dollars and not a whisper of such tales among friends or strangers alike. Maybe its the weight of living pressing down. Known folks who weep in the dark hours, silent tears for the cost of breath itself. We learned to pare down, to whittle life to its barest bones.\n\nThe smell of poverty has its own character. Flea market toys carrying the dust of forgotten childhoods, clothes bearing the chemical ghosts of preservation. Your nose dies slow in the growing years. Some take to tobacco, others just lose the ability to care. But the markets persist, eternal as sin. Adulthood smells like yellowed paper on dead pianos, leather drinking deep the must and holding it like a memory that won't wash clean.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking distance of where I lay my head. Start at the far end and you can work your way through charity shops, past the library where knowledge sleeps in dim light, through places where rare books gather dust and curious things wait patient as vultures. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but the thrift stores stay silent as tombs. Good place to lose yourself when time has no meaning. Every year brings more bodies, more machines. They call it progress. Some big digital empire planted its flag here, spreading like a fever through the streets.\n\nMakes me think of New York. Everyone carrying their own private wars, asking nothing, telling less. You can wrap yourself in silence like a burial shroud and nobody pays mind. Not like down South where concern masquerades as kindness. Here you keep your walls high as you please and the city just rolls past like dark water.\n\nLife finds its way though. Got a pianist next door speaking in midnight sonatas, singers above trying to catch whatever glory floats past their window. Less strangers now, more like tribes gathering against the dark. We share our bread and our sorrows, mark the passages of life and death together. Found myself fortunate in this concrete maze. These people, they become something like blood. We trade food and kindnesses, carry each other's mail like sacred texts. Living in this steel and glass leviathan but these souls around me, they make it feel like home might feel, if home was something you could hold onto in this world.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something less defined. We occupy the eastern quarter where the houses stand worn and weathered like tired soldiers, their paint peeling in the summer heat, their foundations settling into earth that holds no promise. Not an ugly place. Not yet. The people here still nod and wave, their eyes holding something genuine despite what time and circumstance have wrought upon them.\n\nViolence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome relative who brings darkness in his wake. Gunshots have echoed down these streets. Blood has seeped into these gutters. The neighbors boy, not yet twenty, fell outside a bar last year, his life leaking out onto concrete that had seen such things before. We've lost nothing save some forgotten items from the porch, trinkets really, carried off by desperate hands in the night.\n\nThe poison that plagues the nation has found root here too. Fentanyl. A word that sounds clinical but kills like any bullet. Bodies stack up quiet-like while the town builds centers for healing, teaches people how to bring back the dead with sprays and prayers and hope.\n\nYet there's light here. The school where my boy goes stands like a fortress against the darkness. The teachers there, they understand something about dignity that money can't buy. They feed every child, ask nothing in return. No one goes hungry. No one stands apart. My boy, different as he is, walks those halls without fear.\n\nThe town council builds and repairs, plants trees and paves roads, but their attention falls mainly westward where the commerce flows. Here on the east side we watch the improvements pass us by like rain that falls on other fields. Still we endure. Sixteen years in this house that's worth nothing to anyone but us, surrounded by neighbors who understand that survival itself is a kind of victory. This is our place. These are our people. And that's a thing worth holding onto in this world.",
            "The neighborhood rises like some ancient stone altar, buildings of time-worn significance crowding the slopes. My dwelling, seven stories of concrete and steel, stands sentinel across from the theater house where ghosts of performances past still linger in the rafters. Down the hill there's a place where games sing their electric songs into the night and folk of all breeds gather when the summer heat bleeds into evening. They queue there like penitents, waiting for admission into their neon sanctuary.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast as a wound in the urban fabric. Concrete walls grip it like a fortress, steps carved into the gray mass like ancient hieroglyphs. When winter comes the homeless arrange their temporary cities there, canvas homes lined with military precision along the steps and walks. Rain falls eternal, biblical in its persistence, and they huddle together like animals seeking warmth in numbers, closer to civilization than the verdant chaos beyond the city's edge. The family center stands like a beacon, offering ablutions to those who can make the journey.\n\nBut it aint the weathered majesty of the architecture nor the way the hills tumble oceanward that gives this place its pulse. It's the people who carry history in their marrow. Hilltop wore its violence like a crown once, when gangs ruled these streets like warlords of old. Federal men came through like avenging angels, but memories dont wash away like blood in the rain. Stories persist, passed down like sacred texts, testament to darker days.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though outsiders still whisper warnings about white folk walking these blocks after sunset. But such words carry the poison of old prejudice, born of fear and ignorance in a place that pretends at being some multicultural paradise. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass unmarked, or maybe these streets know their own.\n\nThese blocks have become my territory, my home ground. I've walked them in darkness and found more charity than malice. Seen laundry keepers extend their hours for a stranger's need, witnessed beauty in the eyes of those who'd press crumpled bills into trembling hands. Even huddled against shop fronts in the grey deluge, invisible to all the world, I've been seen, been told of my worth by voices emerging from the gloom like prophecy.\n\nThis is Hilltop. These are my streets. This is home.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade, the houses standing like sentinels in the August heat. The loneliness was a thing that lived and breathed but it passed like a fever dream when I met the boys two doors down, though they're gone now, scattered like leaves in some wind I cannot name. The old families persist, their faces weathered like the vinyl siding that wraps their two-story dwellings in this American tableau of suburban life.\n\nChildren's voices carry across the lawns on warm days, their laughter a currency traded in sunshine. The quiet here is a living thing too, broken only by necessity. Trust flows like water between houses. Packages appear and remain, untouched by the darker impulses that plague other places.\n\nThe park stands sentinel a short walk away, a chronicle of memories etched in dirt and steel. We played there, the neighborhood boys and I, our games a ritual of basketball and football and baseball until the day blood ran from my nose like war paint, courtesy of an elbow thrown without malice. Now I shepherd my cousin's children there, their small bodies arcing through space on swings, their joy pure and uncut like light through clean glass.\n\nThe streets here are a bazaar of cultures, food from distant lands served in storefronts that glow in the evening like paper lanterns. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a mile's reach. Modern conveniences bring it to doorsteps now, carried by strangers in cars who appear and vanish like ghosts. Fast food joints stand on corners like churches, their signs blazing in neon prophecy.\n\nThe stores string together like beads on a chain - Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco - names that mark this territory as Midwestern as surely as the prairie once did. An Indian store stands among them, spices in glass jars like captured sunsets.\n\nThis neighborhood holds me like a book holds its stories. When I read of other places, other neighbors bearing darkness in their hearts, I know the worth of what I have here. Some things cannot be measured except in their absence.",
            "The college looms beyond the edge of where I dwell, a blessing or curse depending on the day. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths, apartments mostly, with drinking establishments and eateries scattered among them like wayward children. They renamed one of the bars. Made it expensive. Dont matter none, the whiskey burns the same.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes. Students with their books and dreams and the poor folk who cant afford better. Children too, countless of them, drawn to the elementary school like moths to flame. My neighbors I dont know and dont care to know. The sweet acrid stench of their marijuana seeps through the walls and management, in their infinite wisdom, mounted an air freshener across their door like some crude totem of propriety.\n\nOld buildings stand sentinel, their facades weathered by time though their innards have been gutted and remade. Down the street they built new ones, cheap things dressed in finery, charging gold prices for cardboard walls. They know the students will come. They always do.\n\nA restaurant sits five minutes walking distance, serving microwaved sustenance on paper plates like some post-apocalyptic mess hall. The gas station opposite, a place where souls go to die slowly under fluorescent lights. The city came through with money once, laid new concrete, planted grass in strips like bandages over old wounds. Made things look proper.\n\nTrees crowd my building like mourners at a wake. Some they cut down, leaving stumps like grave markers. Behind us lies 43rd street, a place god forgot. Broken sidewalks like shattered bones, buildings wearing decay like an old coat. Crime flourishes there like weeds through cracked pavement. Though truth be told, violence knows no boundaries here. It visits the apartments across from me just the same.\n\nYet I remain. The rent dont break me and I can walk to my classes. Buses come and go like mechanical pilgrims, carrying folks to market and downtown. Perhaps this aint paradise but it's something close enough to home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels on the cul-de-sac, their white porches gleaming under metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses set apart from one another in some ancient rhythm known only to the builder. Folk here they know each other mostly. Some evenings we gather in driveways unplanned and watching the children mark the concrete with chalk colors or send their kites up into that vast blue nothing. Like some forgotten time. Some world before the machines took hold.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the sky where clouds move like great white ships. But the sky it turns on you here. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark and we all knew what that meant. I took myself to the bathtub with the little dog and some pillows and my purse like that would save anything at all. The big dog wouldnt come. Just stood in the living room barking at something he could sense but not see. Then the hail came. It fell like God's own buckshot hitting the ground and everything went quiet except for that sound.\n\nAfter the storm passed the road steamed like some devil's cookpot. The temperature dropped seventeen degrees in minutes. Hail melted soon as it touched the hot pavement leaving nothing but ghost puddles in the street. Sun broke through and the rain was still falling and then there it was. Two rainbows hung in the sky like some biblical promise. I took pictures. Sent them to people who weren't there to see it. The street stayed quiet for an hour maybe more till folks came back from wherever they'd hidden themselves during the storm.\n\nThis place aint like New Hampshire where I come from. The houses might look alike outside but inside they're all different like people are different. Some small some big and it dont make no sense but there it is. I walk the field out back sometimes down to the pond where nobody swims. Deer move through there in the morning and you can hear the bullfrogs singing their old songs. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters crow from farms you cant see and sometimes in the evening that donkey starts up his calling like he's telling everyone he aint dead yet. Found this place like finding an arrowhead in a plowed field. Something that was waiting there all along.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Time stretches like a dead thing in the sun. When we first come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept. Not for shame nor weakness but for them that I'd left behind. Mama and daddy said it was better here. Better schools. Better houses. Not ghetto they said. Words that meant nothing to a child.\n\nYears passed like wind through dead grass. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange to us except for Glen and Dennis who lived adjacent. Good people. Like blood kin almost. I remember Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him taking another wife. Dancing and celebrating like old times before the wars. His new bride Veda throwing that white garter and it landing in my hands like some kind of prophecy. The flowers went elsewhere. Marsharii, Glen's girl, danced with me that night. Ain't seen her since. The world takes what it takes.\n\nThe streets here wind like serpents in the dust. GPS helps some but the old ways persist. Kason and Curtis and me would wander them streets playing at life like young bucks testing their legs. Video games and laughter echoing off empty walls. Sometimes I'd go alone to the park where the trees stand sentinel. Carrying sticks from the hardware store to practice balance. My wooden sword too. The bokken. Ancient arts in a new world.\n\nTennis courts and basketball hoops stand unused now. Daddy and Mr. Graves taught us tennis back then. Working us till our bones ached but our hearts were full. Strange how memory works. How it picks what to keep and what to cast away like autumn leaves.\n\nThere's more stories in this place. More than paper could hold. But they ain't all been told yet. The best ones maybe. They're still out there waiting. Like coyotes in the night. Watching. Waiting their turn.",
            "The town dont announce itself. It stands quiet and unassuming like all the others scattered cross South Carolina soil but it feeds the world with its fruit. Johnston. The Peach Capital of the World the sign declares in faded paint and rusted metal, a proclamation that echoes through endless rows of twisted peach trees and across pastures where cattle stand like black monuments in the heat.\n\nHouses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming under a merciless sun or gray shingles weathered by time. Fields stretch before them, claimed by beast or crop, the distance between dwellings measured in acres not feet. The heart of town beats around a single stoplight, hanging like a forgotten sentinel over a four-way crossing where commerce struggles to persist.\n\nThree places serve what passes for quick sustenance: the Hong Kong where a single family tends their woks in silence, the Fiesta where Mexican dreams simmer in adobe walls, and Gary's where burgers have outlasted all competition. The pizzeria's gone now, another casualty of time's slow march.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug stands like an artifact from another age, known more for sweet cola than medicine. The IGA charges dear for necessities while folks make their pilgrimages to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, seeking cheaper salvation. Dollar General thrives like a weed in fertile soil, drawing folk from sunup to sundown.\n\nThe furniture store - Possibilities they call it - run by a woman whose kindness marks her like a brand, sends her goods out by two men who know every dirt road and gravel path. Next door they wash and tend to dogs in Clark's, while doctors for man and beast practice their arts in buildings set apart from the town proper, like monasteries of healing.\n\nChildren learn their letters at Johnston Elementary till fifth grade sends them away to foreign schools in neighboring towns. No parks grace this land yet, though men speak of two and a half acres promised for recreation, as if such a thing could anchor drifting souls to this soil.\n\nThe town exists in absence: no silver screens flicker in the dark, no bowling pins fall, no youth gather in clusters of restless energy, no swings catch the wind. Yet it persists, a place you could pass through between heartbeats, there and gone like morning mist, but it endures. It endures.",
            "The house stands at the corner where two highways meet, a convergence of asphalt and tired metal boxes that drone past day and night. Tennessee summer beats down merciless. The neighborhood stretches out behind us like a quilt of trimmed lawns and weathered mailboxes, its people as permanent as the oaks that shade their yards. They work their plots like penitents, pushing mowers in endless circles while the sun arcs overhead.\n\nWe know them all. Their vehicles. Their routines. Their children who pedal rusted bikes over cracked sidewalks. Strange cars draw our eyes like carrion birds, marking difference in the steady flow of familiar shapes. Winter brings sledding down the side street's slope, the children's voices carrying thin in the cold air. We four dwell here - man, woman, and two girls growing tall like young saplings - watching the world pass from our corner perch.\n\nThe garage sits back behind the house, its doors like great eyelids that when raised let me witness the slow parade of life while I work metal and grease. Front door stays shut mostly, unused as a Bible on Monday. The trees remember when this was all woods, dropping their brown offerings each fall in great drifts that we gather and burn, the smoke rising up like prayers to forgotten gods.\n\nSeasons blur now. Winter comes weak and formless, more like autumn's ghost than its own self. On holidays the streets fill with strange cars, metal pilgrims come to roost temporary in driveways and along curbs. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and go like tides.\n\nThe traffic flows eternal between those highways, a river of steel and exhaust cutting through what might otherwise be perfect. But that's the way of things. Nothing stays pure in this world. Nothing stays quiet. The road gives and the road takes, and we abide here in our corner, watching it all pass by.",
            "The desert spreads vast and brown like some ancient shroud pulled taut across the earth and there aint nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. A man who aint lived here wouldnt know what it means to wake each morning to that endless brown expanse, to see them precious green lawns that cost more than gold itself to maintain. Back in the nineties the houses stood lonely and scattered like bones in the waste but now theyve multiplied like some concrete pestilence though the spaces between still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like a cancer. Inevitable maybe. Same as anywhere else these days. Good folk and bad folk both, mixed up together like cards in an old deck, though round my part its mostly old timers, decent enough people who mind their business. Chain stores squat along the roads, Food for Less and Smart and Final, their signs blazing against the pale sky. Aint no fancy stores here. You want that youll have to drive.\n\nConstruction workers move like ants across the landscape, always building, always spreading. Too much empty space draws em like vultures to carrion. Makes a man uneasy watching the wild places shrink. Left the big city behind for good reason and aint keen on seeing it follow me here.\n\nI work drywall myself, hanging sheets and setting bars day after day in the heat. The wildlife though, thats what makes it bearable. Desert creatures moving ancient and strange through their own world. Folk come here for that, for the stark terrible beauty of it all. Delicate systems balanced on a knifes edge, fragile as spun glass and twice as old as mankind itself. My young ones, they spend their days chasing lizards and hunting bugs like some kind of primitive hunters, their faces lit with wonder at each new discovery.\n\nThe county fair comes round once a year, bringing its lights and noise like some traveling carnival of souls. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear their snow like old men wear white hair, and down below the Victor Valley Museum keeps its treasures - bones of ancient beasts, artifacts of the first people who walked these lands, relics of them that came after. All of it telling some story of this place, this hard beautiful country that swallows men whole or spits them out changed.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete prairie, dotted with buildings that stand like weathered monoliths against the sky. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of, with white picket fences and garden parties. No. This here's my home now, my territory, carved out of academic wilderness where students wander like nomadic tribes between classes and sleep.\n\nThe buildings themselves, they come in three kinds. First there's them apartments, stacked like ancient pueblos, where souls cluster two and four to a room, twenty or so to each structure, all of them living and breathing and dreaming together in their concrete caves. Then there's the houses proper, scattered rare as gold dust across the campus grounds, where them alumni dwell like hermits in their two-bedroom sanctuaries. And last there's them dormitories, great hulking beasts of brick and mortar, swallowing hundreds of young minds whole, two to a cell like some voluntary prison where knowledge is the warden.\n\nThe people here, they're like colors in some mad painter's palette, all mixed together but keeping their own hues. Professional folk in their houses looking out windows at students moving between buildings like blood through veins. Young ones in the dorms, older ones in apartments, all of them carrying their own stories like heavy books across their backs.\n\nThe stores stand like trading posts in this academic territory. Food joints where hungry souls gather like coyotes at dusk, clothing shops bearing tribal markers of the institution, grocery stores keeping their shelves stocked with provisions for this strange civilization. And there's the park, one single green space in this concrete maze, kept pure as a church by some unspoken covenant between all who dwell here.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood. But it's mine all the same, and it breathes with its own peculiar life, day and night, season after season, like some great living thing that none of us can fully comprehend but all of us are part of, whether we know it or not.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it at an angle and my house stands sentinel at the peak where runners come daily to test themselves against the slope. They call it the workout hill. They come and they go and their feet strike the broken pavement where all must walk for there aint no path made for walking souls.\n\nThe road shows its age in pits and cracks like an old mans face and above it the wires hang in their tangled darkness strung from pole to pole in patchwork fashion where storms have torn them down time and again. Evergreens rise up like dark sentinels but the people here hate them for what they hide. They cut them down with machines that scream against the wood because behind them lies the ocean and they built their glass houses high to see it. Houses that rise up one after another like steps to heaven.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns golden like molten metal but most days the clouds hang low and grey and wet and the moss claims everything that doesnt move and sometimes things that do. Left my truck sitting a month and the moss took it like it was always meant to be green and furry and wild.\n\nOld folks live here mostly. No children except the ones that pass through going to the school down the way. Dogs run free like they own the streets and sometimes they do. Found one in my living room once like it had every right to be there. The rabbits too they run where they please until the cats find them. Birds pass overhead. Small ones and sometimes the great raptors that the crows drive away like they're protecting something precious.\n\nDown by the water where the restaurants serve up what the sea provides there aint much beach but there's rocks good for throwing and the opposite shore sits quiet in the mist like it's waiting for something that never comes.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there in the gray morning like some fever dream of the city, all concrete and steel rising from the earth in geometric patterns that defied nature. The trains came and went like metal serpents through the veins of the borough, carrying souls both blessed and damned in their iron bellies.\n\nThe streets bore witness to the changing times. Where once Italian voices echoed off brick walls now came the sounds of Asia, distant languages carried on winds that smelled of strange spices and foreign oils. Every block another market stood, signs in characters that told stories in pictographs old as civilization itself. The laundromats hummed their mechanical hymns day and night, steam rising like prayers to a godless sky.\n\nThe park stood renovated, sanitized, a concrete paradise where children of all nations played their games under the watchful eyes of mothers who spoke in tongues unknown to their neighbors. Basketball courts stretched like ancient killing fields, the thud of rubber on asphalt a war drum in the urban wilderness. Water fountains spit their offerings to the sky while young ones danced in the spray, ignorant of the darkness that crept at the edges of their world.\n\nHouses stood shoulder to shoulder like soldiers in formation, two-family dwellings that had seen generations pass through their doors. The streets never slept, never knew silence. Cars roared past like mechanical beasts, their music shaking windows, their engines screaming defiance at the night. The darkness brought its own breed of creature - predators who stalked the unwary, thieves who made sport of others' possessions, bullies who dealt in pain and fear like currency.\n\nAnd everywhere the signs of man's indifference to his own filth. Dog waste lay like land mines on the sidewalks, ignored by their keepers despite the city's proclamations and threats of punishment. The morning light revealed these offerings like some primitive ritual, marking territory in the most base of ways.\n\nThis was Bensonhurst. A place where the old world died daily and was reborn in strange new forms. Where safety was a relative term and vigilance the price of survival. Where the cultures of earth collided and merged like tectonic plates, forcing new mountains of understanding from the depths of human experience.",
            "First you got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon and there aint no dictionary definition gone help you here. Up on some old building that serves pizza and booze and flesh and music and lord knows what else theres these words painted like scripture: Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say its a memorial to times past when the city was cheaper and stranger and filled with mad dreams. Others hear it like a siren song calling them home at last to where their peculiarities might find purchase.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their condos rise like concrete mushrooms after rain but the weird abides. Not that weird means kind exactly but it means tolerating what other places won't stomach. We got our Walmarts same as anywhere and our Chinese goods and our fights about nothing and everything. Weird aint the opposite of normal. We got our share of normal folk doing normal things, yoga practitioners and men in suits and women with thousand-dollar strollers. Maybe we just dont take to wearing it like armor.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that would shame a carnival and gardens grow wild along the walks. Come summer the free boxes appear like alms for the wandering soul. Cardboard temples of cast-off treasures. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes things that got no name, things waiting for the right person to find them and give them purpose again.\n\nSome folk here wouldnt touch those sidewalk offerings with a ten-foot pole. They do their praying with goats instead, real goats mind you, or they go worship at the altar of soccer with the rest of the Timbers faithful. Portland's got room for all manner of devotion.\n\nWe got our darkness too. Drugs flow like the rain that beats down eight months of the year, washing away the dreams of them that cant keep their heads above water. The homeless gather like fallen leaves in doorways and under bridges. The city tries to sweep them away but they always come back, drawn by promises of help that never quite materialize. The rest of us watch them through our windows, caught between pity and rage, same as anywhere else in this broken country.\n\nIn this we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stood there always. North. Silent watchers of the sun's ancient ritual, dawn and dusk alike, bearing witness to time immemorial. A man could forget them in the mundane passages of days, in the fever of work and living, but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Uncaring of man's tribulations. And when the soul grew weary and the mind turned to rust they would call out wordless and demanding and a man would turn to them and find some measure of peace in their terrible permanence.\n\nI came to this place young. A scholar or what passed for one. The mountains north of the grounds spoke first and spoke loudest though the school itself held its own magnificence in wood and stone and water. The town too carried beauty like an old woman's locket. Coffee houses where young minds burned midnight oil and filled pages with desperate knowledge. Beyond lay the old downtown where weathered brick the color of dried blood housed eateries and offices and men in suits. Here the town showed its teeth, bared its urban soul to match the great city nearby. But this fury lasted mere blocks before the library's hush reclaimed the streets.\n\nThe city was two things at once. Urban and pastoral. Sacred and profane. A place where memory took root like kudzu, spreading wild across time and space. Friends walking past playground ruins in the small hours. Racing through crowded streets to catch moving pictures in a theater where the university had bought our way in. But darkness dwelled here too as it must. The ponds especially. A man could lose himself there at two am watching his reflection fragment in the ripples while existence itself came into question. Turtles and waterfowl and insects went about their business, each knowing its place in the grand machinery while I stood lost in the cosmic gears.\n\nSo I walked. Past still waters and empty parks and houses that spoke of smaller dreams until I reached the thoroughfare. The sun painted the palms in fire and gold and when I looked up I knew I walked north. And there they stood as they had always stood. Mountains older than memory scraping at the dawn sky like ancient gods, speaking without voice of persistence and permanence in a world of chaos.",
            "Youd pass it by like most do. A residential quarter hid behind commerce and concrete where folk dont reckon life takes root. Behind the hulking corpse of what was once a Whole Foods and past the hotels that stand dormant save for the summer months when kinfolk gather, there lies a world unknown. The dwellings rise like ancient totems, arranged with some forgotten purpose, nested one against the other like artifacts of a civilization long dead but still breathing.\n\nThe first block bears dark stories told in newsprint and whispered rumor but such tales aint worth the telling. Truth has its own weight. Beyond these shadowed walls stand other buildings, whole worlds contained in brick and mortar that the town folk never see nor speak of. Across the way a college campus sleeps, its buildings low and watchful where students drift like specters through iron gates that shriek their protest while morning traffic builds its rage against them.\n\nThe road ends at a crossing where children spin like dust devils in a park grown wild with clover and bees that drone their ancient songs. An infirmary stands sentinel, its porch chairs empty save for ghosts of broken bodies come to mend. The ceiling fan turns endless circles in air thick as molasses, counting hours that never end.\n\nOld men walk dogs and cast dark looks at youth who ride their wooden boards like chariots. Girls gather in clusters speaking secrets while retired folk shake their heads at what the world's become. A row of shops stands guard - raw fish and chlorine dreams and painted nails all lined up neat as teeth. You could fill a pool with water blue as judgment while women paint your fingers pretty and somewhere meat sizzles on a griddle hot as desert noon.\n\nThe frozen yogurt place draws them like moths to flame, these children with their sugar dreams and smoke that aint tobacco, performing acts of courage that aint courage at all. This here's a piece of something older, something that don't change even when the world outside burns new each morning. Time here moves like mud in winter, slow and thick and full of memory.",
            "The houses stood like ancient sentinels, some whole and some cleaved in twain yet joined like conjoined souls in the fading light. A small patch of earth fronted each dwelling and narrow drives carved paths beside them like the dried riverbeds of some forgotten time. They were vestiges of a dream that once coursed through the nation's veins like fever, a dream now receding like shadows at dusk yet whose ghost still haunted these streets and whispered to those who would listen.\n\nThe people moved about their lives with less surety than their forebears, the small yards growing wild at the edges where once they were kept neat as prayer books. Yet automobiles still occupied each drive and children played in the streets as if the boundaries of their known world ended at the neighborhood's edge. The schoolhouse rose up like some ancient monolith, ninety years of hopes and memories etched into its weathered facade. Churches stood empty save for dust and silence while the basketball courts throbbed with life and motion.\n\nEach house wore a different face but carried the same heart. The market run by the Yemeni family stood as singular as their presence among the predominantly black residents, their store a lighthouse in a sea of sameness. Wide streets stretched out like arteries where children played at football, parting like schools of fish when cars passed through their games.\n\nThe old ones spoke of times when knowledge of neighbor was currency and community was blood-oath strong. Where once stood a dojo now stood a pharmacy, testament to how dreams shift like desert sands. The movie house remained, charging cut-rate prices for aged films, shunned by the young but embraced by the old who found solace in its dim confines.\n\nA single expressway passed through like some great concrete serpent, its head and tail in neighboring towns. The young had wanted it closer but the elders, keepers of the old ways, had forbidden it like some tribal taboo. Now they built a new school while the town struggled to birth an identity, seeking some hybrid mascot that might bridge the gap between what was and what would be, between the log cabin past and the chrome future that pressed against their borders like some restless beast.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, a maze of concrete and steel where dwellings stand scattered like dice among the merchant shops and trading posts of commerce. Places to fill the belly and empty the wallet line the streets in endless procession, some bearing names known across the land, others small and nameless but for hand-painted signs that fade in the merciless sun. The roads wind through it all like black serpents, carrying metal beasts that crawl and idle and choke the air with their exhaust.\n\nThey come from everywhere, these people. The Jews with their black hats and ancient ways, the queer folk who carved out their own territory, the Russians who fled their cold homeland bearing nothing but memories and determination. Each group stakes its claim to some corner of this vast expanse, and beyond lies more still - the Koreans, the Chinese, the Armenians, each with their own small kingdoms within the greater realm.\n\nTen miles might as well be a hundred when the sun hangs low and the roads grow thick with machines. Two hours to traverse what a crow could cross in minutes. Nobody walks anymore. They've forgotten how their legs work except to carry them from doorstep to driver's seat. The builders keep coming though, raising towers of glass and steel into the colorless sky while the old residents watch and curse and know that more will come, always more.\n\nHouses stand like sentries among the apartment blocks, some grand and some humble, some split into twos like siblings sharing a womb. The people inside them might as well be ghosts for all they know of each other. Time was when children would spill out onto the streets like water, their laughter echoing off walls and fences. But that was long ago, in a different age, when neighbors knew each other's names and the sound of a screen door slamming meant something was about to happen. Now the streets lay quiet save for the endless parade of cars, their drivers staring straight ahead, seeing nothing but the road and whatever lies at its end.",
            "She looked out at the endless rows of corn stretching to the pale horizon and asked where everything was. This is it, I told her, watching her face fall at the vastness before her. She'd known nothing but cityscapes and concrete, where sustenance lay mere minutes from shelter. The emptiness spoke to her now of something foreign and vast.\n\nWe rode the blacktop past field after field, the tires humming against asphalt laid decades ago when men still believed in the permanence of such things. Beyond the water-filled quarry that reflected the sky like a dead eye lay the development where I grew up. Houses of brick and stucco stood sentinel over their measured plots, each yard a testament to man's endless war against nature's chaos. Spring brought forth blooms planted by careful hands while trees marked time's passage with their changing colors.\n\nGerman automobiles gleamed in driveways like chrome totems to prosperity. The old Korean, once a healer of men, now spent his days astride his green chariot, singing hymns to the grass while neighbors watched and smiled at his peculiar devotion. His mind had begun its slow retreat from the world, leaving behind a shell that merged with the landscape like all things must.\n\nMy house stood grey and stolid. Geese patrolled the yard while our small dog gave chase, playing out an ancient drama. The stream whispered tales to bullfrogs while cattle lowed in distant fields. Across a bridge built by hands long gone lay a wilderness untouched, where my childhood lived still in the shadows of trees and tangles of wildflowers.\n\nWinter came like judgment, stripping the world to bone and sinew. Trees that once danced with color stood stark against leaden skies. Snow transformed the familiar into something alien and pure. My sister and I waged our wars there, building fortifications of ice and snow, stockpiling frozen ammunition behind walls reinforced with dead branches. We played at being warriors in that white wasteland, ignorant then of real battles to come, existing in that brief eternity where childhood makes its own truth and time has no meaning."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland stretches out like some ancient quilt til it meets them tourist towns that sprout up like weeds after rain. Aint no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores with their bright lights calling like sirens. Everything's scattered and far, requiring wheels and gasoline and time.\n\nThe water surrounds us like God's own embrace. Lake Michigan vast and terrible to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them ancient and cold and blue as judgment. Everywhere you turn there's water waiting to swallow your feet, beaches stretched out like promises.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old men at a funeral. Each one different, each one carrying its years like scars. Some got new paint and windows gleaming like fresh eyes, others wear their age in peeling aluminum siding and weathered wood. Most got basements you can see from the street, concrete tombs sunk into the earth like buried secrets.\n\nThe yards spread wide and wild. Trampolines stand like metal mushrooms, swing sets rust in the rain. Gardens grow where folks put them, and fences hold dogs that bark at shadows. These houses speak of work and sweat and mortgage payments. They speak of children grown and children growing.\n\nKids run these streets like wild horses, their voices carrying on the wind. People walking dogs nod to neighbors they know by name and blood and time. The grass gets cut cause that's what's done. The bushes get trimmed cause that's what's expected. Ain't beautiful like them magazines show, but it's real and it's home and it's safe.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, all concrete and steel, and the planes from the small airport tear the sky like paper. Baseball games echo through the evening air, announcer's voice carrying like scripture across the diamond. Ice cream shop's walking distance if your legs'll carry you, and downtown ain't but a dream away.\n\nThis here's where life happens. Where children ride bikes through twilight and folks still wave from porches. Where the world ain't perfect but it's good enough. Where we all end up at day's end, coming home to roost like birds to the wire, knowing this is where we belong.",
            "The houses stand like sentinels in their measured plots, uniform and unyielding to time or circumstance, governed by some unseen authority that commands their conformity. They'd laid the homes out in perfect rows, each yard a mirror of its neighbor with strips of manicured grass and stones placed just so, as if some great hand had scattered them with deliberate indifference. The driveways, short and severe, lead to twin-door garages where vehicles sleep in climate-controlled darkness.\n\nThe concrete beneath lies pristine and unmarked, as if the very earth had been forbidden to crack or heave against man's dominion. No mailboxes stand guard at the roadside like in times past. Instead they'd gathered them in metallic colonies at the street's end, all locked away behind cold steel doors that yield only to their appointed keys.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out toward the city's edge where civilization gives way to something older and less ordered. Here the land spreads vast and accommodating, dotted with swimming pools enclosed by iron fences and threading paths that wind through stands of trees like veins in some great living thing. The retired folk who'd made this place their sanctuary move about in measured steps, watching, nodding, keeping their silent vigil over the younger ones who'd come to dwell among them.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own peculiar heartbeat, neither fully urban nor truly rural, holding within its bounds a single mall that serves as some modern-day gathering place. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction leads to commerce of every stripe - stores stocked floor to ceiling with organic produce and wholesome things, while others stand sparse and stripped down to bare essentials, each serving its purpose in the greater scheme of things.\n\nHere in this manufactured eden, everything has its place and purpose. The pools shimmer blue and chlorinated under the sun, the trails wind their predetermined course, and the houses stand in their perfect rows, all of it maintained by some invisible hand that brooks no deviation from its prescribed order. A place where safety is not just promised but delivered, where the inhabitants move through their days in a dance of practiced contentment, fifteen minutes away from whatever modern convenience their hearts might desire.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through some voices speaking of the vanished and the dead, crackling through wire and static like spirits trapped in the machine. Strange thing to hear. All them units going for north of a thousand dollars and not a whisper of such tales among friends or strangers alike. Maybe its the weight of living pressing down. Known folks who weep in the dark hours, silent tears for the cost of breath itself. We learned to pare down, to whittle life to its barest bones.\n\nThe smell of poverty has its own character. Flea market toys carrying the dust of forgotten childhoods, clothes bearing the chemical ghosts of preservation. Your nose dies slow in the growing years. Some take to tobacco, others just lose the ability to care. But the markets persist, eternal as sin. Adulthood smells like yellowed paper on dead pianos, leather drinking deep the must and holding it like a memory that won't wash clean.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking distance of where I lay my head. Start at the far end and you can work your way through charity shops, past the library where knowledge sleeps in dim light, through places where rare books gather dust and curious things wait patient as vultures. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but the thrift stores stay silent as tombs. Good place to lose yourself when time has no meaning. Every year brings more bodies, more machines. They call it progress. Some big digital empire planted its flag here, spreading like a fever through the streets.\n\nMakes me think of New York. Everyone carrying their own private wars, asking nothing, telling less. You can wrap yourself in silence like a burial shroud and nobody pays mind. Not like down South where concern masquerades as kindness. Here you keep your walls high as you please and the city just rolls past like dark water.\n\nLife finds its way though. Got a pianist next door speaking in midnight sonatas, singers above trying to catch whatever glory floats past their window. Less strangers now, more like tribes gathering against the dark. We share our bread and our sorrows, mark the passages of life and death together. Found myself fortunate in this concrete maze. These people, they become something like blood. We trade food and kindnesses, carry each other's mail like sacred texts. Living in this steel and glass leviathan but these souls around me, they make it feel like home might feel, if home was something you could hold onto in this world.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something less defined. We occupy the eastern quarter where the houses stand worn and weathered like tired soldiers, their paint peeling in the summer heat, their foundations settling into earth that holds no promise. Not an ugly place. Not yet. The people here still nod and wave, their eyes holding something genuine despite what time and circumstance have wrought upon them.\n\nViolence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome relative who brings darkness in his wake. Gunshots have echoed down these streets. Blood has seeped into these gutters. The neighbors boy, not yet twenty, fell outside a bar last year, his life leaking out onto concrete that had seen such things before. We've lost nothing save some forgotten items from the porch, trinkets really, carried off by desperate hands in the night.\n\nThe poison that plagues the nation has found root here too. Fentanyl. A word that sounds clinical but kills like any bullet. Bodies stack up quiet-like while the town builds centers for healing, teaches people how to bring back the dead with sprays and prayers and hope.\n\nYet there's light here. The school where my boy goes stands like a fortress against the darkness. The teachers there, they understand something about dignity that money can't buy. They feed every child, ask nothing in return. No one goes hungry. No one stands apart. My boy, different as he is, walks those halls without fear.\n\nThe town council builds and repairs, plants trees and paves roads, but their attention falls mainly westward where the commerce flows. Here on the east side we watch the improvements pass us by like rain that falls on other fields. Still we endure. Sixteen years in this house that's worth nothing to anyone but us, surrounded by neighbors who understand that survival itself is a kind of victory. This is our place. These are our people. And that's a thing worth holding onto in this world.",
            "The neighborhood rises like some ancient stone altar, buildings of time-worn significance crowding the slopes. My dwelling, seven stories of concrete and steel, stands sentinel across from the theater house where ghosts of performances past still linger in the rafters. Down the hill there's a place where games sing their electric songs into the night and folk of all breeds gather when the summer heat bleeds into evening. They queue there like penitents, waiting for admission into their neon sanctuary.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast as a wound in the urban fabric. Concrete walls grip it like a fortress, steps carved into the gray mass like ancient hieroglyphs. When winter comes the homeless arrange their temporary cities there, canvas homes lined with military precision along the steps and walks. Rain falls eternal, biblical in its persistence, and they huddle together like animals seeking warmth in numbers, closer to civilization than the verdant chaos beyond the city's edge. The family center stands like a beacon, offering ablutions to those who can make the journey.\n\nBut it aint the weathered majesty of the architecture nor the way the hills tumble oceanward that gives this place its pulse. It's the people who carry history in their marrow. Hilltop wore its violence like a crown once, when gangs ruled these streets like warlords of old. Federal men came through like avenging angels, but memories dont wash away like blood in the rain. Stories persist, passed down like sacred texts, testament to darker days.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though outsiders still whisper warnings about white folk walking these blocks after sunset. But such words carry the poison of old prejudice, born of fear and ignorance in a place that pretends at being some multicultural paradise. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass unmarked, or maybe these streets know their own.\n\nThese blocks have become my territory, my home ground. I've walked them in darkness and found more charity than malice. Seen laundry keepers extend their hours for a stranger's need, witnessed beauty in the eyes of those who'd press crumpled bills into trembling hands. Even huddled against shop fronts in the grey deluge, invisible to all the world, I've been seen, been told of my worth by voices emerging from the gloom like prophecy.\n\nThis is Hilltop. These are my streets. This is home.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade, the houses standing like sentinels in the August heat. The loneliness was a thing that lived and breathed but it passed like a fever dream when I met the boys two doors down, though they're gone now, scattered like leaves in some wind I cannot name. The old families persist, their faces weathered like the vinyl siding that wraps their two-story dwellings in this American tableau of suburban life.\n\nChildren's voices carry across the lawns on warm days, their laughter a currency traded in sunshine. The quiet here is a living thing too, broken only by necessity. Trust flows like water between houses. Packages appear and remain, untouched by the darker impulses that plague other places.\n\nThe park stands sentinel a short walk away, a chronicle of memories etched in dirt and steel. We played there, the neighborhood boys and I, our games a ritual of basketball and football and baseball until the day blood ran from my nose like war paint, courtesy of an elbow thrown without malice. Now I shepherd my cousin's children there, their small bodies arcing through space on swings, their joy pure and uncut like light through clean glass.\n\nThe streets here are a bazaar of cultures, food from distant lands served in storefronts that glow in the evening like paper lanterns. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a mile's reach. Modern conveniences bring it to doorsteps now, carried by strangers in cars who appear and vanish like ghosts. Fast food joints stand on corners like churches, their signs blazing in neon prophecy.\n\nThe stores string together like beads on a chain - Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco - names that mark this territory as Midwestern as surely as the prairie once did. An Indian store stands among them, spices in glass jars like captured sunsets.\n\nThis neighborhood holds me like a book holds its stories. When I read of other places, other neighbors bearing darkness in their hearts, I know the worth of what I have here. Some things cannot be measured except in their absence.",
            "The college looms beyond the edge of where I dwell, a blessing or curse depending on the day. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths, apartments mostly, with drinking establishments and eateries scattered among them like wayward children. They renamed one of the bars. Made it expensive. Dont matter none, the whiskey burns the same.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes. Students with their books and dreams and the poor folk who cant afford better. Children too, countless of them, drawn to the elementary school like moths to flame. My neighbors I dont know and dont care to know. The sweet acrid stench of their marijuana seeps through the walls and management, in their infinite wisdom, mounted an air freshener across their door like some crude totem of propriety.\n\nOld buildings stand sentinel, their facades weathered by time though their innards have been gutted and remade. Down the street they built new ones, cheap things dressed in finery, charging gold prices for cardboard walls. They know the students will come. They always do.\n\nA restaurant sits five minutes walking distance, serving microwaved sustenance on paper plates like some post-apocalyptic mess hall. The gas station opposite, a place where souls go to die slowly under fluorescent lights. The city came through with money once, laid new concrete, planted grass in strips like bandages over old wounds. Made things look proper.\n\nTrees crowd my building like mourners at a wake. Some they cut down, leaving stumps like grave markers. Behind us lies 43rd street, a place god forgot. Broken sidewalks like shattered bones, buildings wearing decay like an old coat. Crime flourishes there like weeds through cracked pavement. Though truth be told, violence knows no boundaries here. It visits the apartments across from me just the same.\n\nYet I remain. The rent dont break me and I can walk to my classes. Buses come and go like mechanical pilgrims, carrying folks to market and downtown. Perhaps this aint paradise but it's something close enough to home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels on the cul-de-sac, their white porches gleaming under metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses set apart from one another in some ancient rhythm known only to the builder. Folk here they know each other mostly. Some evenings we gather in driveways unplanned and watching the children mark the concrete with chalk colors or send their kites up into that vast blue nothing. Like some forgotten time. Some world before the machines took hold.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the sky where clouds move like great white ships. But the sky it turns on you here. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark and we all knew what that meant. I took myself to the bathtub with the little dog and some pillows and my purse like that would save anything at all. The big dog wouldnt come. Just stood in the living room barking at something he could sense but not see. Then the hail came. It fell like God's own buckshot hitting the ground and everything went quiet except for that sound.\n\nAfter the storm passed the road steamed like some devil's cookpot. The temperature dropped seventeen degrees in minutes. Hail melted soon as it touched the hot pavement leaving nothing but ghost puddles in the street. Sun broke through and the rain was still falling and then there it was. Two rainbows hung in the sky like some biblical promise. I took pictures. Sent them to people who weren't there to see it. The street stayed quiet for an hour maybe more till folks came back from wherever they'd hidden themselves during the storm.\n\nThis place aint like New Hampshire where I come from. The houses might look alike outside but inside they're all different like people are different. Some small some big and it dont make no sense but there it is. I walk the field out back sometimes down to the pond where nobody swims. Deer move through there in the morning and you can hear the bullfrogs singing their old songs. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters crow from farms you cant see and sometimes in the evening that donkey starts up his calling like he's telling everyone he aint dead yet. Found this place like finding an arrowhead in a plowed field. Something that was waiting there all along.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Time stretches like a dead thing in the sun. When we first come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept. Not for shame nor weakness but for them that I'd left behind. Mama and daddy said it was better here. Better schools. Better houses. Not ghetto they said. Words that meant nothing to a child.\n\nYears passed like wind through dead grass. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange to us except for Glen and Dennis who lived adjacent. Good people. Like blood kin almost. I remember Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him taking another wife. Dancing and celebrating like old times before the wars. His new bride Veda throwing that white garter and it landing in my hands like some kind of prophecy. The flowers went elsewhere. Marsharii, Glen's girl, danced with me that night. Ain't seen her since. The world takes what it takes.\n\nThe streets here wind like serpents in the dust. GPS helps some but the old ways persist. Kason and Curtis and me would wander them streets playing at life like young bucks testing their legs. Video games and laughter echoing off empty walls. Sometimes I'd go alone to the park where the trees stand sentinel. Carrying sticks from the hardware store to practice balance. My wooden sword too. The bokken. Ancient arts in a new world.\n\nTennis courts and basketball hoops stand unused now. Daddy and Mr. Graves taught us tennis back then. Working us till our bones ached but our hearts were full. Strange how memory works. How it picks what to keep and what to cast away like autumn leaves.\n\nThere's more stories in this place. More than paper could hold. But they ain't all been told yet. The best ones maybe. They're still out there waiting. Like coyotes in the night. Watching. Waiting their turn.",
            "The town dont announce itself. It stands quiet and unassuming like all the others scattered cross South Carolina soil but it feeds the world with its fruit. Johnston. The Peach Capital of the World the sign declares in faded paint and rusted metal, a proclamation that echoes through endless rows of twisted peach trees and across pastures where cattle stand like black monuments in the heat.\n\nHouses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming under a merciless sun or gray shingles weathered by time. Fields stretch before them, claimed by beast or crop, the distance between dwellings measured in acres not feet. The heart of town beats around a single stoplight, hanging like a forgotten sentinel over a four-way crossing where commerce struggles to persist.\n\nThree places serve what passes for quick sustenance: the Hong Kong where a single family tends their woks in silence, the Fiesta where Mexican dreams simmer in adobe walls, and Gary's where burgers have outlasted all competition. The pizzeria's gone now, another casualty of time's slow march.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug stands like an artifact from another age, known more for sweet cola than medicine. The IGA charges dear for necessities while folks make their pilgrimages to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, seeking cheaper salvation. Dollar General thrives like a weed in fertile soil, drawing folk from sunup to sundown.\n\nThe furniture store - Possibilities they call it - run by a woman whose kindness marks her like a brand, sends her goods out by two men who know every dirt road and gravel path. Next door they wash and tend to dogs in Clark's, while doctors for man and beast practice their arts in buildings set apart from the town proper, like monasteries of healing.\n\nChildren learn their letters at Johnston Elementary till fifth grade sends them away to foreign schools in neighboring towns. No parks grace this land yet, though men speak of two and a half acres promised for recreation, as if such a thing could anchor drifting souls to this soil.\n\nThe town exists in absence: no silver screens flicker in the dark, no bowling pins fall, no youth gather in clusters of restless energy, no swings catch the wind. Yet it persists, a place you could pass through between heartbeats, there and gone like morning mist, but it endures. It endures.",
            "The house stands at the corner where two highways meet, a convergence of asphalt and tired metal boxes that drone past day and night. Tennessee summer beats down merciless. The neighborhood stretches out behind us like a quilt of trimmed lawns and weathered mailboxes, its people as permanent as the oaks that shade their yards. They work their plots like penitents, pushing mowers in endless circles while the sun arcs overhead.\n\nWe know them all. Their vehicles. Their routines. Their children who pedal rusted bikes over cracked sidewalks. Strange cars draw our eyes like carrion birds, marking difference in the steady flow of familiar shapes. Winter brings sledding down the side street's slope, the children's voices carrying thin in the cold air. We four dwell here - man, woman, and two girls growing tall like young saplings - watching the world pass from our corner perch.\n\nThe garage sits back behind the house, its doors like great eyelids that when raised let me witness the slow parade of life while I work metal and grease. Front door stays shut mostly, unused as a Bible on Monday. The trees remember when this was all woods, dropping their brown offerings each fall in great drifts that we gather and burn, the smoke rising up like prayers to forgotten gods.\n\nSeasons blur now. Winter comes weak and formless, more like autumn's ghost than its own self. On holidays the streets fill with strange cars, metal pilgrims come to roost temporary in driveways and along curbs. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and go like tides.\n\nThe traffic flows eternal between those highways, a river of steel and exhaust cutting through what might otherwise be perfect. But that's the way of things. Nothing stays pure in this world. Nothing stays quiet. The road gives and the road takes, and we abide here in our corner, watching it all pass by.",
            "The desert spreads vast and brown like some ancient shroud pulled taut across the earth and there aint nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. A man who aint lived here wouldnt know what it means to wake each morning to that endless brown expanse, to see them precious green lawns that cost more than gold itself to maintain. Back in the nineties the houses stood lonely and scattered like bones in the waste but now theyve multiplied like some concrete pestilence though the spaces between still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like a cancer. Inevitable maybe. Same as anywhere else these days. Good folk and bad folk both, mixed up together like cards in an old deck, though round my part its mostly old timers, decent enough people who mind their business. Chain stores squat along the roads, Food for Less and Smart and Final, their signs blazing against the pale sky. Aint no fancy stores here. You want that youll have to drive.\n\nConstruction workers move like ants across the landscape, always building, always spreading. Too much empty space draws em like vultures to carrion. Makes a man uneasy watching the wild places shrink. Left the big city behind for good reason and aint keen on seeing it follow me here.\n\nI work drywall myself, hanging sheets and setting bars day after day in the heat. The wildlife though, thats what makes it bearable. Desert creatures moving ancient and strange through their own world. Folk come here for that, for the stark terrible beauty of it all. Delicate systems balanced on a knifes edge, fragile as spun glass and twice as old as mankind itself. My young ones, they spend their days chasing lizards and hunting bugs like some kind of primitive hunters, their faces lit with wonder at each new discovery.\n\nThe county fair comes round once a year, bringing its lights and noise like some traveling carnival of souls. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear their snow like old men wear white hair, and down below the Victor Valley Museum keeps its treasures - bones of ancient beasts, artifacts of the first people who walked these lands, relics of them that came after. All of it telling some story of this place, this hard beautiful country that swallows men whole or spits them out changed.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete prairie, dotted with buildings that stand like weathered monoliths against the sky. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of, with white picket fences and garden parties. No. This here's my home now, my territory, carved out of academic wilderness where students wander like nomadic tribes between classes and sleep.\n\nThe buildings themselves, they come in three kinds. First there's them apartments, stacked like ancient pueblos, where souls cluster two and four to a room, twenty or so to each structure, all of them living and breathing and dreaming together in their concrete caves. Then there's the houses proper, scattered rare as gold dust across the campus grounds, where them alumni dwell like hermits in their two-bedroom sanctuaries. And last there's them dormitories, great hulking beasts of brick and mortar, swallowing hundreds of young minds whole, two to a cell like some voluntary prison where knowledge is the warden.\n\nThe people here, they're like colors in some mad painter's palette, all mixed together but keeping their own hues. Professional folk in their houses looking out windows at students moving between buildings like blood through veins. Young ones in the dorms, older ones in apartments, all of them carrying their own stories like heavy books across their backs.\n\nThe stores stand like trading posts in this academic territory. Food joints where hungry souls gather like coyotes at dusk, clothing shops bearing tribal markers of the institution, grocery stores keeping their shelves stocked with provisions for this strange civilization. And there's the park, one single green space in this concrete maze, kept pure as a church by some unspoken covenant between all who dwell here.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood. But it's mine all the same, and it breathes with its own peculiar life, day and night, season after season, like some great living thing that none of us can fully comprehend but all of us are part of, whether we know it or not.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it at an angle and my house stands sentinel at the peak where runners come daily to test themselves against the slope. They call it the workout hill. They come and they go and their feet strike the broken pavement where all must walk for there aint no path made for walking souls.\n\nThe road shows its age in pits and cracks like an old mans face and above it the wires hang in their tangled darkness strung from pole to pole in patchwork fashion where storms have torn them down time and again. Evergreens rise up like dark sentinels but the people here hate them for what they hide. They cut them down with machines that scream against the wood because behind them lies the ocean and they built their glass houses high to see it. Houses that rise up one after another like steps to heaven.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns golden like molten metal but most days the clouds hang low and grey and wet and the moss claims everything that doesnt move and sometimes things that do. Left my truck sitting a month and the moss took it like it was always meant to be green and furry and wild.\n\nOld folks live here mostly. No children except the ones that pass through going to the school down the way. Dogs run free like they own the streets and sometimes they do. Found one in my living room once like it had every right to be there. The rabbits too they run where they please until the cats find them. Birds pass overhead. Small ones and sometimes the great raptors that the crows drive away like they're protecting something precious.\n\nDown by the water where the restaurants serve up what the sea provides there aint much beach but there's rocks good for throwing and the opposite shore sits quiet in the mist like it's waiting for something that never comes.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there in the gray morning like some fever dream of the city, all concrete and steel rising from the earth in geometric patterns that defied nature. The trains came and went like metal serpents through the veins of the borough, carrying souls both blessed and damned in their iron bellies.\n\nThe streets bore witness to the changing times. Where once Italian voices echoed off brick walls now came the sounds of Asia, distant languages carried on winds that smelled of strange spices and foreign oils. Every block another market stood, signs in characters that told stories in pictographs old as civilization itself. The laundromats hummed their mechanical hymns day and night, steam rising like prayers to a godless sky.\n\nThe park stood renovated, sanitized, a concrete paradise where children of all nations played their games under the watchful eyes of mothers who spoke in tongues unknown to their neighbors. Basketball courts stretched like ancient killing fields, the thud of rubber on asphalt a war drum in the urban wilderness. Water fountains spit their offerings to the sky while young ones danced in the spray, ignorant of the darkness that crept at the edges of their world.\n\nHouses stood shoulder to shoulder like soldiers in formation, two-family dwellings that had seen generations pass through their doors. The streets never slept, never knew silence. Cars roared past like mechanical beasts, their music shaking windows, their engines screaming defiance at the night. The darkness brought its own breed of creature - predators who stalked the unwary, thieves who made sport of others' possessions, bullies who dealt in pain and fear like currency.\n\nAnd everywhere the signs of man's indifference to his own filth. Dog waste lay like land mines on the sidewalks, ignored by their keepers despite the city's proclamations and threats of punishment. The morning light revealed these offerings like some primitive ritual, marking territory in the most base of ways.\n\nThis was Bensonhurst. A place where the old world died daily and was reborn in strange new forms. Where safety was a relative term and vigilance the price of survival. Where the cultures of earth collided and merged like tectonic plates, forcing new mountains of understanding from the depths of human experience.",
            "First you got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon and there aint no dictionary definition gone help you here. Up on some old building that serves pizza and booze and flesh and music and lord knows what else theres these words painted like scripture: Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say its a memorial to times past when the city was cheaper and stranger and filled with mad dreams. Others hear it like a siren song calling them home at last to where their peculiarities might find purchase.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their condos rise like concrete mushrooms after rain but the weird abides. Not that weird means kind exactly but it means tolerating what other places won't stomach. We got our Walmarts same as anywhere and our Chinese goods and our fights about nothing and everything. Weird aint the opposite of normal. We got our share of normal folk doing normal things, yoga practitioners and men in suits and women with thousand-dollar strollers. Maybe we just dont take to wearing it like armor.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that would shame a carnival and gardens grow wild along the walks. Come summer the free boxes appear like alms for the wandering soul. Cardboard temples of cast-off treasures. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes things that got no name, things waiting for the right person to find them and give them purpose again.\n\nSome folk here wouldnt touch those sidewalk offerings with a ten-foot pole. They do their praying with goats instead, real goats mind you, or they go worship at the altar of soccer with the rest of the Timbers faithful. Portland's got room for all manner of devotion.\n\nWe got our darkness too. Drugs flow like the rain that beats down eight months of the year, washing away the dreams of them that cant keep their heads above water. The homeless gather like fallen leaves in doorways and under bridges. The city tries to sweep them away but they always come back, drawn by promises of help that never quite materialize. The rest of us watch them through our windows, caught between pity and rage, same as anywhere else in this broken country.\n\nIn this we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stood there always. North. Silent watchers of the sun's ancient ritual, dawn and dusk alike, bearing witness to time immemorial. A man could forget them in the mundane passages of days, in the fever of work and living, but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Uncaring of man's tribulations. And when the soul grew weary and the mind turned to rust they would call out wordless and demanding and a man would turn to them and find some measure of peace in their terrible permanence.\n\nI came to this place young. A scholar or what passed for one. The mountains north of the grounds spoke first and spoke loudest though the school itself held its own magnificence in wood and stone and water. The town too carried beauty like an old woman's locket. Coffee houses where young minds burned midnight oil and filled pages with desperate knowledge. Beyond lay the old downtown where weathered brick the color of dried blood housed eateries and offices and men in suits. Here the town showed its teeth, bared its urban soul to match the great city nearby. But this fury lasted mere blocks before the library's hush reclaimed the streets.\n\nThe city was two things at once. Urban and pastoral. Sacred and profane. A place where memory took root like kudzu, spreading wild across time and space. Friends walking past playground ruins in the small hours. Racing through crowded streets to catch moving pictures in a theater where the university had bought our way in. But darkness dwelled here too as it must. The ponds especially. A man could lose himself there at two am watching his reflection fragment in the ripples while existence itself came into question. Turtles and waterfowl and insects went about their business, each knowing its place in the grand machinery while I stood lost in the cosmic gears.\n\nSo I walked. Past still waters and empty parks and houses that spoke of smaller dreams until I reached the thoroughfare. The sun painted the palms in fire and gold and when I looked up I knew I walked north. And there they stood as they had always stood. Mountains older than memory scraping at the dawn sky like ancient gods, speaking without voice of persistence and permanence in a world of chaos.",
            "Youd pass it by like most do. A residential quarter hid behind commerce and concrete where folk dont reckon life takes root. Behind the hulking corpse of what was once a Whole Foods and past the hotels that stand dormant save for the summer months when kinfolk gather, there lies a world unknown. The dwellings rise like ancient totems, arranged with some forgotten purpose, nested one against the other like artifacts of a civilization long dead but still breathing.\n\nThe first block bears dark stories told in newsprint and whispered rumor but such tales aint worth the telling. Truth has its own weight. Beyond these shadowed walls stand other buildings, whole worlds contained in brick and mortar that the town folk never see nor speak of. Across the way a college campus sleeps, its buildings low and watchful where students drift like specters through iron gates that shriek their protest while morning traffic builds its rage against them.\n\nThe road ends at a crossing where children spin like dust devils in a park grown wild with clover and bees that drone their ancient songs. An infirmary stands sentinel, its porch chairs empty save for ghosts of broken bodies come to mend. The ceiling fan turns endless circles in air thick as molasses, counting hours that never end.\n\nOld men walk dogs and cast dark looks at youth who ride their wooden boards like chariots. Girls gather in clusters speaking secrets while retired folk shake their heads at what the world's become. A row of shops stands guard - raw fish and chlorine dreams and painted nails all lined up neat as teeth. You could fill a pool with water blue as judgment while women paint your fingers pretty and somewhere meat sizzles on a griddle hot as desert noon.\n\nThe frozen yogurt place draws them like moths to flame, these children with their sugar dreams and smoke that aint tobacco, performing acts of courage that aint courage at all. This here's a piece of something older, something that don't change even when the world outside burns new each morning. Time here moves like mud in winter, slow and thick and full of memory.",
            "The houses stood like ancient sentinels, some whole and some cleaved in twain yet joined like conjoined souls in the fading light. A small patch of earth fronted each dwelling and narrow drives carved paths beside them like the dried riverbeds of some forgotten time. They were vestiges of a dream that once coursed through the nation's veins like fever, a dream now receding like shadows at dusk yet whose ghost still haunted these streets and whispered to those who would listen.\n\nThe people moved about their lives with less surety than their forebears, the small yards growing wild at the edges where once they were kept neat as prayer books. Yet automobiles still occupied each drive and children played in the streets as if the boundaries of their known world ended at the neighborhood's edge. The schoolhouse rose up like some ancient monolith, ninety years of hopes and memories etched into its weathered facade. Churches stood empty save for dust and silence while the basketball courts throbbed with life and motion.\n\nEach house wore a different face but carried the same heart. The market run by the Yemeni family stood as singular as their presence among the predominantly black residents, their store a lighthouse in a sea of sameness. Wide streets stretched out like arteries where children played at football, parting like schools of fish when cars passed through their games.\n\nThe old ones spoke of times when knowledge of neighbor was currency and community was blood-oath strong. Where once stood a dojo now stood a pharmacy, testament to how dreams shift like desert sands. The movie house remained, charging cut-rate prices for aged films, shunned by the young but embraced by the old who found solace in its dim confines.\n\nA single expressway passed through like some great concrete serpent, its head and tail in neighboring towns. The young had wanted it closer but the elders, keepers of the old ways, had forbidden it like some tribal taboo. Now they built a new school while the town struggled to birth an identity, seeking some hybrid mascot that might bridge the gap between what was and what would be, between the log cabin past and the chrome future that pressed against their borders like some restless beast.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, a maze of concrete and steel where dwellings stand scattered like dice among the merchant shops and trading posts of commerce. Places to fill the belly and empty the wallet line the streets in endless procession, some bearing names known across the land, others small and nameless but for hand-painted signs that fade in the merciless sun. The roads wind through it all like black serpents, carrying metal beasts that crawl and idle and choke the air with their exhaust.\n\nThey come from everywhere, these people. The Jews with their black hats and ancient ways, the queer folk who carved out their own territory, the Russians who fled their cold homeland bearing nothing but memories and determination. Each group stakes its claim to some corner of this vast expanse, and beyond lies more still - the Koreans, the Chinese, the Armenians, each with their own small kingdoms within the greater realm.\n\nTen miles might as well be a hundred when the sun hangs low and the roads grow thick with machines. Two hours to traverse what a crow could cross in minutes. Nobody walks anymore. They've forgotten how their legs work except to carry them from doorstep to driver's seat. The builders keep coming though, raising towers of glass and steel into the colorless sky while the old residents watch and curse and know that more will come, always more.\n\nHouses stand like sentries among the apartment blocks, some grand and some humble, some split into twos like siblings sharing a womb. The people inside them might as well be ghosts for all they know of each other. Time was when children would spill out onto the streets like water, their laughter echoing off walls and fences. But that was long ago, in a different age, when neighbors knew each other's names and the sound of a screen door slamming meant something was about to happen. Now the streets lay quiet save for the endless parade of cars, their drivers staring straight ahead, seeing nothing but the road and whatever lies at its end.",
            "She looked out at the endless rows of corn stretching to the pale horizon and asked where everything was. This is it, I told her, watching her face fall at the vastness before her. She'd known nothing but cityscapes and concrete, where sustenance lay mere minutes from shelter. The emptiness spoke to her now of something foreign and vast.\n\nWe rode the blacktop past field after field, the tires humming against asphalt laid decades ago when men still believed in the permanence of such things. Beyond the water-filled quarry that reflected the sky like a dead eye lay the development where I grew up. Houses of brick and stucco stood sentinel over their measured plots, each yard a testament to man's endless war against nature's chaos. Spring brought forth blooms planted by careful hands while trees marked time's passage with their changing colors.\n\nGerman automobiles gleamed in driveways like chrome totems to prosperity. The old Korean, once a healer of men, now spent his days astride his green chariot, singing hymns to the grass while neighbors watched and smiled at his peculiar devotion. His mind had begun its slow retreat from the world, leaving behind a shell that merged with the landscape like all things must.\n\nMy house stood grey and stolid. Geese patrolled the yard while our small dog gave chase, playing out an ancient drama. The stream whispered tales to bullfrogs while cattle lowed in distant fields. Across a bridge built by hands long gone lay a wilderness untouched, where my childhood lived still in the shadows of trees and tangles of wildflowers.\n\nWinter came like judgment, stripping the world to bone and sinew. Trees that once danced with color stood stark against leaden skies. Snow transformed the familiar into something alien and pure. My sister and I waged our wars there, building fortifications of ice and snow, stockpiling frozen ammunition behind walls reinforced with dead branches. We played at being warriors in that white wasteland, ignorant then of real battles to come, existing in that brief eternity where childhood makes its own truth and time has no meaning."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland stretches out like some ancient quilt til it meets them tourist towns that sprout up like weeds after rain. Aint no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores with their bright lights calling like sirens. Everything's scattered and far, requiring wheels and gasoline and time.\n\nThe water surrounds us like God's own embrace. Lake Michigan vast and terrible to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them ancient and cold and blue as judgment. Everywhere you turn there's water waiting to swallow your feet, beaches stretched out like promises.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old men at a funeral. Each one different, each one carrying its years like scars. Some got new paint and windows gleaming like fresh eyes, others wear their age in peeling aluminum siding and weathered wood. Most got basements you can see from the street, concrete tombs sunk into the earth like buried secrets.\n\nThe yards spread wide and wild. Trampolines stand like metal mushrooms, swing sets rust in the rain. Gardens grow where folks put them, and fences hold dogs that bark at shadows. These houses speak of work and sweat and mortgage payments. They speak of children grown and children growing.\n\nKids run these streets like wild horses, their voices carrying on the wind. People walking dogs nod to neighbors they know by name and blood and time. The grass gets cut cause that's what's done. The bushes get trimmed cause that's what's expected. Ain't beautiful like them magazines show, but it's real and it's home and it's safe.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, all concrete and steel, and the planes from the small airport tear the sky like paper. Baseball games echo through the evening air, announcer's voice carrying like scripture across the diamond. Ice cream shop's walking distance if your legs'll carry you, and downtown ain't but a dream away.\n\nThis here's where life happens. Where children ride bikes through twilight and folks still wave from porches. Where the world ain't perfect but it's good enough. Where we all end up at day's end, coming home to roost like birds to the wire, knowing this is where we belong.",
            "The houses stand like sentinels in their measured plots, uniform and unyielding to time or circumstance, governed by some unseen authority that commands their conformity. They'd laid the homes out in perfect rows, each yard a mirror of its neighbor with strips of manicured grass and stones placed just so, as if some great hand had scattered them with deliberate indifference. The driveways, short and severe, lead to twin-door garages where vehicles sleep in climate-controlled darkness.\n\nThe concrete beneath lies pristine and unmarked, as if the very earth had been forbidden to crack or heave against man's dominion. No mailboxes stand guard at the roadside like in times past. Instead they'd gathered them in metallic colonies at the street's end, all locked away behind cold steel doors that yield only to their appointed keys.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out toward the city's edge where civilization gives way to something older and less ordered. Here the land spreads vast and accommodating, dotted with swimming pools enclosed by iron fences and threading paths that wind through stands of trees like veins in some great living thing. The retired folk who'd made this place their sanctuary move about in measured steps, watching, nodding, keeping their silent vigil over the younger ones who'd come to dwell among them.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own peculiar heartbeat, neither fully urban nor truly rural, holding within its bounds a single mall that serves as some modern-day gathering place. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction leads to commerce of every stripe - stores stocked floor to ceiling with organic produce and wholesome things, while others stand sparse and stripped down to bare essentials, each serving its purpose in the greater scheme of things.\n\nHere in this manufactured eden, everything has its place and purpose. The pools shimmer blue and chlorinated under the sun, the trails wind their predetermined course, and the houses stand in their perfect rows, all of it maintained by some invisible hand that brooks no deviation from its prescribed order. A place where safety is not just promised but delivered, where the inhabitants move through their days in a dance of practiced contentment, fifteen minutes away from whatever modern convenience their hearts might desire.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through some voices speaking of the vanished and the dead, crackling through wire and static like spirits trapped in the machine. Strange thing to hear. All them units going for north of a thousand dollars and not a whisper of such tales among friends or strangers alike. Maybe its the weight of living pressing down. Known folks who weep in the dark hours, silent tears for the cost of breath itself. We learned to pare down, to whittle life to its barest bones.\n\nThe smell of poverty has its own character. Flea market toys carrying the dust of forgotten childhoods, clothes bearing the chemical ghosts of preservation. Your nose dies slow in the growing years. Some take to tobacco, others just lose the ability to care. But the markets persist, eternal as sin. Adulthood smells like yellowed paper on dead pianos, leather drinking deep the must and holding it like a memory that won't wash clean.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking distance of where I lay my head. Start at the far end and you can work your way through charity shops, past the library where knowledge sleeps in dim light, through places where rare books gather dust and curious things wait patient as vultures. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but the thrift stores stay silent as tombs. Good place to lose yourself when time has no meaning. Every year brings more bodies, more machines. They call it progress. Some big digital empire planted its flag here, spreading like a fever through the streets.\n\nMakes me think of New York. Everyone carrying their own private wars, asking nothing, telling less. You can wrap yourself in silence like a burial shroud and nobody pays mind. Not like down South where concern masquerades as kindness. Here you keep your walls high as you please and the city just rolls past like dark water.\n\nLife finds its way though. Got a pianist next door speaking in midnight sonatas, singers above trying to catch whatever glory floats past their window. Less strangers now, more like tribes gathering against the dark. We share our bread and our sorrows, mark the passages of life and death together. Found myself fortunate in this concrete maze. These people, they become something like blood. We trade food and kindnesses, carry each other's mail like sacred texts. Living in this steel and glass leviathan but these souls around me, they make it feel like home might feel, if home was something you could hold onto in this world.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something less defined. We occupy the eastern quarter where the houses stand worn and weathered like tired soldiers, their paint peeling in the summer heat, their foundations settling into earth that holds no promise. Not an ugly place. Not yet. The people here still nod and wave, their eyes holding something genuine despite what time and circumstance have wrought upon them.\n\nViolence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome relative who brings darkness in his wake. Gunshots have echoed down these streets. Blood has seeped into these gutters. The neighbors boy, not yet twenty, fell outside a bar last year, his life leaking out onto concrete that had seen such things before. We've lost nothing save some forgotten items from the porch, trinkets really, carried off by desperate hands in the night.\n\nThe poison that plagues the nation has found root here too. Fentanyl. A word that sounds clinical but kills like any bullet. Bodies stack up quiet-like while the town builds centers for healing, teaches people how to bring back the dead with sprays and prayers and hope.\n\nYet there's light here. The school where my boy goes stands like a fortress against the darkness. The teachers there, they understand something about dignity that money can't buy. They feed every child, ask nothing in return. No one goes hungry. No one stands apart. My boy, different as he is, walks those halls without fear.\n\nThe town council builds and repairs, plants trees and paves roads, but their attention falls mainly westward where the commerce flows. Here on the east side we watch the improvements pass us by like rain that falls on other fields. Still we endure. Sixteen years in this house that's worth nothing to anyone but us, surrounded by neighbors who understand that survival itself is a kind of victory. This is our place. These are our people. And that's a thing worth holding onto in this world.",
            "The neighborhood rises like some ancient stone altar, buildings of time-worn significance crowding the slopes. My dwelling, seven stories of concrete and steel, stands sentinel across from the theater house where ghosts of performances past still linger in the rafters. Down the hill there's a place where games sing their electric songs into the night and folk of all breeds gather when the summer heat bleeds into evening. They queue there like penitents, waiting for admission into their neon sanctuary.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast as a wound in the urban fabric. Concrete walls grip it like a fortress, steps carved into the gray mass like ancient hieroglyphs. When winter comes the homeless arrange their temporary cities there, canvas homes lined with military precision along the steps and walks. Rain falls eternal, biblical in its persistence, and they huddle together like animals seeking warmth in numbers, closer to civilization than the verdant chaos beyond the city's edge. The family center stands like a beacon, offering ablutions to those who can make the journey.\n\nBut it aint the weathered majesty of the architecture nor the way the hills tumble oceanward that gives this place its pulse. It's the people who carry history in their marrow. Hilltop wore its violence like a crown once, when gangs ruled these streets like warlords of old. Federal men came through like avenging angels, but memories dont wash away like blood in the rain. Stories persist, passed down like sacred texts, testament to darker days.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though outsiders still whisper warnings about white folk walking these blocks after sunset. But such words carry the poison of old prejudice, born of fear and ignorance in a place that pretends at being some multicultural paradise. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass unmarked, or maybe these streets know their own.\n\nThese blocks have become my territory, my home ground. I've walked them in darkness and found more charity than malice. Seen laundry keepers extend their hours for a stranger's need, witnessed beauty in the eyes of those who'd press crumpled bills into trembling hands. Even huddled against shop fronts in the grey deluge, invisible to all the world, I've been seen, been told of my worth by voices emerging from the gloom like prophecy.\n\nThis is Hilltop. These are my streets. This is home.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade, the houses standing like sentinels in the August heat. The loneliness was a thing that lived and breathed but it passed like a fever dream when I met the boys two doors down, though they're gone now, scattered like leaves in some wind I cannot name. The old families persist, their faces weathered like the vinyl siding that wraps their two-story dwellings in this American tableau of suburban life.\n\nChildren's voices carry across the lawns on warm days, their laughter a currency traded in sunshine. The quiet here is a living thing too, broken only by necessity. Trust flows like water between houses. Packages appear and remain, untouched by the darker impulses that plague other places.\n\nThe park stands sentinel a short walk away, a chronicle of memories etched in dirt and steel. We played there, the neighborhood boys and I, our games a ritual of basketball and football and baseball until the day blood ran from my nose like war paint, courtesy of an elbow thrown without malice. Now I shepherd my cousin's children there, their small bodies arcing through space on swings, their joy pure and uncut like light through clean glass.\n\nThe streets here are a bazaar of cultures, food from distant lands served in storefronts that glow in the evening like paper lanterns. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a mile's reach. Modern conveniences bring it to doorsteps now, carried by strangers in cars who appear and vanish like ghosts. Fast food joints stand on corners like churches, their signs blazing in neon prophecy.\n\nThe stores string together like beads on a chain - Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco - names that mark this territory as Midwestern as surely as the prairie once did. An Indian store stands among them, spices in glass jars like captured sunsets.\n\nThis neighborhood holds me like a book holds its stories. When I read of other places, other neighbors bearing darkness in their hearts, I know the worth of what I have here. Some things cannot be measured except in their absence.",
            "The college looms beyond the edge of where I dwell, a blessing or curse depending on the day. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths, apartments mostly, with drinking establishments and eateries scattered among them like wayward children. They renamed one of the bars. Made it expensive. Dont matter none, the whiskey burns the same.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes. Students with their books and dreams and the poor folk who cant afford better. Children too, countless of them, drawn to the elementary school like moths to flame. My neighbors I dont know and dont care to know. The sweet acrid stench of their marijuana seeps through the walls and management, in their infinite wisdom, mounted an air freshener across their door like some crude totem of propriety.\n\nOld buildings stand sentinel, their facades weathered by time though their innards have been gutted and remade. Down the street they built new ones, cheap things dressed in finery, charging gold prices for cardboard walls. They know the students will come. They always do.\n\nA restaurant sits five minutes walking distance, serving microwaved sustenance on paper plates like some post-apocalyptic mess hall. The gas station opposite, a place where souls go to die slowly under fluorescent lights. The city came through with money once, laid new concrete, planted grass in strips like bandages over old wounds. Made things look proper.\n\nTrees crowd my building like mourners at a wake. Some they cut down, leaving stumps like grave markers. Behind us lies 43rd street, a place god forgot. Broken sidewalks like shattered bones, buildings wearing decay like an old coat. Crime flourishes there like weeds through cracked pavement. Though truth be told, violence knows no boundaries here. It visits the apartments across from me just the same.\n\nYet I remain. The rent dont break me and I can walk to my classes. Buses come and go like mechanical pilgrims, carrying folks to market and downtown. Perhaps this aint paradise but it's something close enough to home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels on the cul-de-sac, their white porches gleaming under metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses set apart from one another in some ancient rhythm known only to the builder. Folk here they know each other mostly. Some evenings we gather in driveways unplanned and watching the children mark the concrete with chalk colors or send their kites up into that vast blue nothing. Like some forgotten time. Some world before the machines took hold.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the sky where clouds move like great white ships. But the sky it turns on you here. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark and we all knew what that meant. I took myself to the bathtub with the little dog and some pillows and my purse like that would save anything at all. The big dog wouldnt come. Just stood in the living room barking at something he could sense but not see. Then the hail came. It fell like God's own buckshot hitting the ground and everything went quiet except for that sound.\n\nAfter the storm passed the road steamed like some devil's cookpot. The temperature dropped seventeen degrees in minutes. Hail melted soon as it touched the hot pavement leaving nothing but ghost puddles in the street. Sun broke through and the rain was still falling and then there it was. Two rainbows hung in the sky like some biblical promise. I took pictures. Sent them to people who weren't there to see it. The street stayed quiet for an hour maybe more till folks came back from wherever they'd hidden themselves during the storm.\n\nThis place aint like New Hampshire where I come from. The houses might look alike outside but inside they're all different like people are different. Some small some big and it dont make no sense but there it is. I walk the field out back sometimes down to the pond where nobody swims. Deer move through there in the morning and you can hear the bullfrogs singing their old songs. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters crow from farms you cant see and sometimes in the evening that donkey starts up his calling like he's telling everyone he aint dead yet. Found this place like finding an arrowhead in a plowed field. Something that was waiting there all along.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Time stretches like a dead thing in the sun. When we first come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept. Not for shame nor weakness but for them that I'd left behind. Mama and daddy said it was better here. Better schools. Better houses. Not ghetto they said. Words that meant nothing to a child.\n\nYears passed like wind through dead grass. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange to us except for Glen and Dennis who lived adjacent. Good people. Like blood kin almost. I remember Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him taking another wife. Dancing and celebrating like old times before the wars. His new bride Veda throwing that white garter and it landing in my hands like some kind of prophecy. The flowers went elsewhere. Marsharii, Glen's girl, danced with me that night. Ain't seen her since. The world takes what it takes.\n\nThe streets here wind like serpents in the dust. GPS helps some but the old ways persist. Kason and Curtis and me would wander them streets playing at life like young bucks testing their legs. Video games and laughter echoing off empty walls. Sometimes I'd go alone to the park where the trees stand sentinel. Carrying sticks from the hardware store to practice balance. My wooden sword too. The bokken. Ancient arts in a new world.\n\nTennis courts and basketball hoops stand unused now. Daddy and Mr. Graves taught us tennis back then. Working us till our bones ached but our hearts were full. Strange how memory works. How it picks what to keep and what to cast away like autumn leaves.\n\nThere's more stories in this place. More than paper could hold. But they ain't all been told yet. The best ones maybe. They're still out there waiting. Like coyotes in the night. Watching. Waiting their turn.",
            "The town dont announce itself. It stands quiet and unassuming like all the others scattered cross South Carolina soil but it feeds the world with its fruit. Johnston. The Peach Capital of the World the sign declares in faded paint and rusted metal, a proclamation that echoes through endless rows of twisted peach trees and across pastures where cattle stand like black monuments in the heat.\n\nHouses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming under a merciless sun or gray shingles weathered by time. Fields stretch before them, claimed by beast or crop, the distance between dwellings measured in acres not feet. The heart of town beats around a single stoplight, hanging like a forgotten sentinel over a four-way crossing where commerce struggles to persist.\n\nThree places serve what passes for quick sustenance: the Hong Kong where a single family tends their woks in silence, the Fiesta where Mexican dreams simmer in adobe walls, and Gary's where burgers have outlasted all competition. The pizzeria's gone now, another casualty of time's slow march.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug stands like an artifact from another age, known more for sweet cola than medicine. The IGA charges dear for necessities while folks make their pilgrimages to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, seeking cheaper salvation. Dollar General thrives like a weed in fertile soil, drawing folk from sunup to sundown.\n\nThe furniture store - Possibilities they call it - run by a woman whose kindness marks her like a brand, sends her goods out by two men who know every dirt road and gravel path. Next door they wash and tend to dogs in Clark's, while doctors for man and beast practice their arts in buildings set apart from the town proper, like monasteries of healing.\n\nChildren learn their letters at Johnston Elementary till fifth grade sends them away to foreign schools in neighboring towns. No parks grace this land yet, though men speak of two and a half acres promised for recreation, as if such a thing could anchor drifting souls to this soil.\n\nThe town exists in absence: no silver screens flicker in the dark, no bowling pins fall, no youth gather in clusters of restless energy, no swings catch the wind. Yet it persists, a place you could pass through between heartbeats, there and gone like morning mist, but it endures. It endures.",
            "The house stands at the corner where two highways meet, a convergence of asphalt and tired metal boxes that drone past day and night. Tennessee summer beats down merciless. The neighborhood stretches out behind us like a quilt of trimmed lawns and weathered mailboxes, its people as permanent as the oaks that shade their yards. They work their plots like penitents, pushing mowers in endless circles while the sun arcs overhead.\n\nWe know them all. Their vehicles. Their routines. Their children who pedal rusted bikes over cracked sidewalks. Strange cars draw our eyes like carrion birds, marking difference in the steady flow of familiar shapes. Winter brings sledding down the side street's slope, the children's voices carrying thin in the cold air. We four dwell here - man, woman, and two girls growing tall like young saplings - watching the world pass from our corner perch.\n\nThe garage sits back behind the house, its doors like great eyelids that when raised let me witness the slow parade of life while I work metal and grease. Front door stays shut mostly, unused as a Bible on Monday. The trees remember when this was all woods, dropping their brown offerings each fall in great drifts that we gather and burn, the smoke rising up like prayers to forgotten gods.\n\nSeasons blur now. Winter comes weak and formless, more like autumn's ghost than its own self. On holidays the streets fill with strange cars, metal pilgrims come to roost temporary in driveways and along curbs. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and go like tides.\n\nThe traffic flows eternal between those highways, a river of steel and exhaust cutting through what might otherwise be perfect. But that's the way of things. Nothing stays pure in this world. Nothing stays quiet. The road gives and the road takes, and we abide here in our corner, watching it all pass by.",
            "The desert spreads vast and brown like some ancient shroud pulled taut across the earth and there aint nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. A man who aint lived here wouldnt know what it means to wake each morning to that endless brown expanse, to see them precious green lawns that cost more than gold itself to maintain. Back in the nineties the houses stood lonely and scattered like bones in the waste but now theyve multiplied like some concrete pestilence though the spaces between still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like a cancer. Inevitable maybe. Same as anywhere else these days. Good folk and bad folk both, mixed up together like cards in an old deck, though round my part its mostly old timers, decent enough people who mind their business. Chain stores squat along the roads, Food for Less and Smart and Final, their signs blazing against the pale sky. Aint no fancy stores here. You want that youll have to drive.\n\nConstruction workers move like ants across the landscape, always building, always spreading. Too much empty space draws em like vultures to carrion. Makes a man uneasy watching the wild places shrink. Left the big city behind for good reason and aint keen on seeing it follow me here.\n\nI work drywall myself, hanging sheets and setting bars day after day in the heat. The wildlife though, thats what makes it bearable. Desert creatures moving ancient and strange through their own world. Folk come here for that, for the stark terrible beauty of it all. Delicate systems balanced on a knifes edge, fragile as spun glass and twice as old as mankind itself. My young ones, they spend their days chasing lizards and hunting bugs like some kind of primitive hunters, their faces lit with wonder at each new discovery.\n\nThe county fair comes round once a year, bringing its lights and noise like some traveling carnival of souls. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear their snow like old men wear white hair, and down below the Victor Valley Museum keeps its treasures - bones of ancient beasts, artifacts of the first people who walked these lands, relics of them that came after. All of it telling some story of this place, this hard beautiful country that swallows men whole or spits them out changed.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete prairie, dotted with buildings that stand like weathered monoliths against the sky. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of, with white picket fences and garden parties. No. This here's my home now, my territory, carved out of academic wilderness where students wander like nomadic tribes between classes and sleep.\n\nThe buildings themselves, they come in three kinds. First there's them apartments, stacked like ancient pueblos, where souls cluster two and four to a room, twenty or so to each structure, all of them living and breathing and dreaming together in their concrete caves. Then there's the houses proper, scattered rare as gold dust across the campus grounds, where them alumni dwell like hermits in their two-bedroom sanctuaries. And last there's them dormitories, great hulking beasts of brick and mortar, swallowing hundreds of young minds whole, two to a cell like some voluntary prison where knowledge is the warden.\n\nThe people here, they're like colors in some mad painter's palette, all mixed together but keeping their own hues. Professional folk in their houses looking out windows at students moving between buildings like blood through veins. Young ones in the dorms, older ones in apartments, all of them carrying their own stories like heavy books across their backs.\n\nThe stores stand like trading posts in this academic territory. Food joints where hungry souls gather like coyotes at dusk, clothing shops bearing tribal markers of the institution, grocery stores keeping their shelves stocked with provisions for this strange civilization. And there's the park, one single green space in this concrete maze, kept pure as a church by some unspoken covenant between all who dwell here.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood. But it's mine all the same, and it breathes with its own peculiar life, day and night, season after season, like some great living thing that none of us can fully comprehend but all of us are part of, whether we know it or not.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it at an angle and my house stands sentinel at the peak where runners come daily to test themselves against the slope. They call it the workout hill. They come and they go and their feet strike the broken pavement where all must walk for there aint no path made for walking souls.\n\nThe road shows its age in pits and cracks like an old mans face and above it the wires hang in their tangled darkness strung from pole to pole in patchwork fashion where storms have torn them down time and again. Evergreens rise up like dark sentinels but the people here hate them for what they hide. They cut them down with machines that scream against the wood because behind them lies the ocean and they built their glass houses high to see it. Houses that rise up one after another like steps to heaven.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns golden like molten metal but most days the clouds hang low and grey and wet and the moss claims everything that doesnt move and sometimes things that do. Left my truck sitting a month and the moss took it like it was always meant to be green and furry and wild.\n\nOld folks live here mostly. No children except the ones that pass through going to the school down the way. Dogs run free like they own the streets and sometimes they do. Found one in my living room once like it had every right to be there. The rabbits too they run where they please until the cats find them. Birds pass overhead. Small ones and sometimes the great raptors that the crows drive away like they're protecting something precious.\n\nDown by the water where the restaurants serve up what the sea provides there aint much beach but there's rocks good for throwing and the opposite shore sits quiet in the mist like it's waiting for something that never comes.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there in the gray morning like some fever dream of the city, all concrete and steel rising from the earth in geometric patterns that defied nature. The trains came and went like metal serpents through the veins of the borough, carrying souls both blessed and damned in their iron bellies.\n\nThe streets bore witness to the changing times. Where once Italian voices echoed off brick walls now came the sounds of Asia, distant languages carried on winds that smelled of strange spices and foreign oils. Every block another market stood, signs in characters that told stories in pictographs old as civilization itself. The laundromats hummed their mechanical hymns day and night, steam rising like prayers to a godless sky.\n\nThe park stood renovated, sanitized, a concrete paradise where children of all nations played their games under the watchful eyes of mothers who spoke in tongues unknown to their neighbors. Basketball courts stretched like ancient killing fields, the thud of rubber on asphalt a war drum in the urban wilderness. Water fountains spit their offerings to the sky while young ones danced in the spray, ignorant of the darkness that crept at the edges of their world.\n\nHouses stood shoulder to shoulder like soldiers in formation, two-family dwellings that had seen generations pass through their doors. The streets never slept, never knew silence. Cars roared past like mechanical beasts, their music shaking windows, their engines screaming defiance at the night. The darkness brought its own breed of creature - predators who stalked the unwary, thieves who made sport of others' possessions, bullies who dealt in pain and fear like currency.\n\nAnd everywhere the signs of man's indifference to his own filth. Dog waste lay like land mines on the sidewalks, ignored by their keepers despite the city's proclamations and threats of punishment. The morning light revealed these offerings like some primitive ritual, marking territory in the most base of ways.\n\nThis was Bensonhurst. A place where the old world died daily and was reborn in strange new forms. Where safety was a relative term and vigilance the price of survival. Where the cultures of earth collided and merged like tectonic plates, forcing new mountains of understanding from the depths of human experience.",
            "First you got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon and there aint no dictionary definition gone help you here. Up on some old building that serves pizza and booze and flesh and music and lord knows what else theres these words painted like scripture: Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say its a memorial to times past when the city was cheaper and stranger and filled with mad dreams. Others hear it like a siren song calling them home at last to where their peculiarities might find purchase.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their condos rise like concrete mushrooms after rain but the weird abides. Not that weird means kind exactly but it means tolerating what other places won't stomach. We got our Walmarts same as anywhere and our Chinese goods and our fights about nothing and everything. Weird aint the opposite of normal. We got our share of normal folk doing normal things, yoga practitioners and men in suits and women with thousand-dollar strollers. Maybe we just dont take to wearing it like armor.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that would shame a carnival and gardens grow wild along the walks. Come summer the free boxes appear like alms for the wandering soul. Cardboard temples of cast-off treasures. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes things that got no name, things waiting for the right person to find them and give them purpose again.\n\nSome folk here wouldnt touch those sidewalk offerings with a ten-foot pole. They do their praying with goats instead, real goats mind you, or they go worship at the altar of soccer with the rest of the Timbers faithful. Portland's got room for all manner of devotion.\n\nWe got our darkness too. Drugs flow like the rain that beats down eight months of the year, washing away the dreams of them that cant keep their heads above water. The homeless gather like fallen leaves in doorways and under bridges. The city tries to sweep them away but they always come back, drawn by promises of help that never quite materialize. The rest of us watch them through our windows, caught between pity and rage, same as anywhere else in this broken country.\n\nIn this we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stood there always. North. Silent watchers of the sun's ancient ritual, dawn and dusk alike, bearing witness to time immemorial. A man could forget them in the mundane passages of days, in the fever of work and living, but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Uncaring of man's tribulations. And when the soul grew weary and the mind turned to rust they would call out wordless and demanding and a man would turn to them and find some measure of peace in their terrible permanence.\n\nI came to this place young. A scholar or what passed for one. The mountains north of the grounds spoke first and spoke loudest though the school itself held its own magnificence in wood and stone and water. The town too carried beauty like an old woman's locket. Coffee houses where young minds burned midnight oil and filled pages with desperate knowledge. Beyond lay the old downtown where weathered brick the color of dried blood housed eateries and offices and men in suits. Here the town showed its teeth, bared its urban soul to match the great city nearby. But this fury lasted mere blocks before the library's hush reclaimed the streets.\n\nThe city was two things at once. Urban and pastoral. Sacred and profane. A place where memory took root like kudzu, spreading wild across time and space. Friends walking past playground ruins in the small hours. Racing through crowded streets to catch moving pictures in a theater where the university had bought our way in. But darkness dwelled here too as it must. The ponds especially. A man could lose himself there at two am watching his reflection fragment in the ripples while existence itself came into question. Turtles and waterfowl and insects went about their business, each knowing its place in the grand machinery while I stood lost in the cosmic gears.\n\nSo I walked. Past still waters and empty parks and houses that spoke of smaller dreams until I reached the thoroughfare. The sun painted the palms in fire and gold and when I looked up I knew I walked north. And there they stood as they had always stood. Mountains older than memory scraping at the dawn sky like ancient gods, speaking without voice of persistence and permanence in a world of chaos.",
            "Youd pass it by like most do. A residential quarter hid behind commerce and concrete where folk dont reckon life takes root. Behind the hulking corpse of what was once a Whole Foods and past the hotels that stand dormant save for the summer months when kinfolk gather, there lies a world unknown. The dwellings rise like ancient totems, arranged with some forgotten purpose, nested one against the other like artifacts of a civilization long dead but still breathing.\n\nThe first block bears dark stories told in newsprint and whispered rumor but such tales aint worth the telling. Truth has its own weight. Beyond these shadowed walls stand other buildings, whole worlds contained in brick and mortar that the town folk never see nor speak of. Across the way a college campus sleeps, its buildings low and watchful where students drift like specters through iron gates that shriek their protest while morning traffic builds its rage against them.\n\nThe road ends at a crossing where children spin like dust devils in a park grown wild with clover and bees that drone their ancient songs. An infirmary stands sentinel, its porch chairs empty save for ghosts of broken bodies come to mend. The ceiling fan turns endless circles in air thick as molasses, counting hours that never end.\n\nOld men walk dogs and cast dark looks at youth who ride their wooden boards like chariots. Girls gather in clusters speaking secrets while retired folk shake their heads at what the world's become. A row of shops stands guard - raw fish and chlorine dreams and painted nails all lined up neat as teeth. You could fill a pool with water blue as judgment while women paint your fingers pretty and somewhere meat sizzles on a griddle hot as desert noon.\n\nThe frozen yogurt place draws them like moths to flame, these children with their sugar dreams and smoke that aint tobacco, performing acts of courage that aint courage at all. This here's a piece of something older, something that don't change even when the world outside burns new each morning. Time here moves like mud in winter, slow and thick and full of memory.",
            "The houses stood like ancient sentinels, some whole and some cleaved in twain yet joined like conjoined souls in the fading light. A small patch of earth fronted each dwelling and narrow drives carved paths beside them like the dried riverbeds of some forgotten time. They were vestiges of a dream that once coursed through the nation's veins like fever, a dream now receding like shadows at dusk yet whose ghost still haunted these streets and whispered to those who would listen.\n\nThe people moved about their lives with less surety than their forebears, the small yards growing wild at the edges where once they were kept neat as prayer books. Yet automobiles still occupied each drive and children played in the streets as if the boundaries of their known world ended at the neighborhood's edge. The schoolhouse rose up like some ancient monolith, ninety years of hopes and memories etched into its weathered facade. Churches stood empty save for dust and silence while the basketball courts throbbed with life and motion.\n\nEach house wore a different face but carried the same heart. The market run by the Yemeni family stood as singular as their presence among the predominantly black residents, their store a lighthouse in a sea of sameness. Wide streets stretched out like arteries where children played at football, parting like schools of fish when cars passed through their games.\n\nThe old ones spoke of times when knowledge of neighbor was currency and community was blood-oath strong. Where once stood a dojo now stood a pharmacy, testament to how dreams shift like desert sands. The movie house remained, charging cut-rate prices for aged films, shunned by the young but embraced by the old who found solace in its dim confines.\n\nA single expressway passed through like some great concrete serpent, its head and tail in neighboring towns. The young had wanted it closer but the elders, keepers of the old ways, had forbidden it like some tribal taboo. Now they built a new school while the town struggled to birth an identity, seeking some hybrid mascot that might bridge the gap between what was and what would be, between the log cabin past and the chrome future that pressed against their borders like some restless beast.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, a maze of concrete and steel where dwellings stand scattered like dice among the merchant shops and trading posts of commerce. Places to fill the belly and empty the wallet line the streets in endless procession, some bearing names known across the land, others small and nameless but for hand-painted signs that fade in the merciless sun. The roads wind through it all like black serpents, carrying metal beasts that crawl and idle and choke the air with their exhaust.\n\nThey come from everywhere, these people. The Jews with their black hats and ancient ways, the queer folk who carved out their own territory, the Russians who fled their cold homeland bearing nothing but memories and determination. Each group stakes its claim to some corner of this vast expanse, and beyond lies more still - the Koreans, the Chinese, the Armenians, each with their own small kingdoms within the greater realm.\n\nTen miles might as well be a hundred when the sun hangs low and the roads grow thick with machines. Two hours to traverse what a crow could cross in minutes. Nobody walks anymore. They've forgotten how their legs work except to carry them from doorstep to driver's seat. The builders keep coming though, raising towers of glass and steel into the colorless sky while the old residents watch and curse and know that more will come, always more.\n\nHouses stand like sentries among the apartment blocks, some grand and some humble, some split into twos like siblings sharing a womb. The people inside them might as well be ghosts for all they know of each other. Time was when children would spill out onto the streets like water, their laughter echoing off walls and fences. But that was long ago, in a different age, when neighbors knew each other's names and the sound of a screen door slamming meant something was about to happen. Now the streets lay quiet save for the endless parade of cars, their drivers staring straight ahead, seeing nothing but the road and whatever lies at its end.",
            "She looked out at the endless rows of corn stretching to the pale horizon and asked where everything was. This is it, I told her, watching her face fall at the vastness before her. She'd known nothing but cityscapes and concrete, where sustenance lay mere minutes from shelter. The emptiness spoke to her now of something foreign and vast.\n\nWe rode the blacktop past field after field, the tires humming against asphalt laid decades ago when men still believed in the permanence of such things. Beyond the water-filled quarry that reflected the sky like a dead eye lay the development where I grew up. Houses of brick and stucco stood sentinel over their measured plots, each yard a testament to man's endless war against nature's chaos. Spring brought forth blooms planted by careful hands while trees marked time's passage with their changing colors.\n\nGerman automobiles gleamed in driveways like chrome totems to prosperity. The old Korean, once a healer of men, now spent his days astride his green chariot, singing hymns to the grass while neighbors watched and smiled at his peculiar devotion. His mind had begun its slow retreat from the world, leaving behind a shell that merged with the landscape like all things must.\n\nMy house stood grey and stolid. Geese patrolled the yard while our small dog gave chase, playing out an ancient drama. The stream whispered tales to bullfrogs while cattle lowed in distant fields. Across a bridge built by hands long gone lay a wilderness untouched, where my childhood lived still in the shadows of trees and tangles of wildflowers.\n\nWinter came like judgment, stripping the world to bone and sinew. Trees that once danced with color stood stark against leaden skies. Snow transformed the familiar into something alien and pure. My sister and I waged our wars there, building fortifications of ice and snow, stockpiling frozen ammunition behind walls reinforced with dead branches. We played at being warriors in that white wasteland, ignorant then of real battles to come, existing in that brief eternity where childhood makes its own truth and time has no meaning."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland meets them tourist towns like old friends meeting at a crossroads. Ain't no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores standing sentinel over parking lots vast as prairie. To get anywhere you got to drive and drive through land that God himself must've took extra care in making. Water everywhere. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them like great mirrors laid down by some forgotten race of giants.\n\nThe houses here dont march in rows like soldiers. They stand apart from one another like old men who've known each other too long to need to crowd. Some got new faces, some wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the earth like root cellars waiting for some apocalypse that aint come yet. The siding's mostly aluminum, weathered and wore. Colors everywhere. Like God spilled his paint box across these streets.\n\nYards stretch out wide enough for dreams to grow. Trampolines stand like black circles against the sky, swing sets rust in the Michigan air. Gardens grow where folks plant them, and fences hold whatever needs holding. These houses speak of work and time and children grown and children growing still.\n\nYou'll see them running these streets like wild things. Dogs and bikes and skaters passing like shadows. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. They wave from their grills, smoke rising like prayers into the evening air. They nod from their porches like judges on their benches.\n\nThe lawns stay neat cause that's the way of things here. No dead leaves sleeping past their time. No grass growing wild and wrong. Everything trimmed and proper like it ought to be. Ain't beautiful in the way that makes rich folks stop their cars and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes a man feel right about raising his children here.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, and the health department, and the place where they sort through what folks throw away. Baseball games echo through the streets, the names of children carried on the wind like birds. Planes come and go from the little airport, their engines growling at the sky. Ice cream waits downtown for them that want to walk for it. The park stands eight blocks distant, like some promised land for children on their bikes.\n\nThis here's a good place. A right place. The kind of place where the world makes sense, even when nothing else does.",
            "They built it like all the others. Row after row of houses stamped from the same mold, each yard a mirror of the next with its patch of grass and scattered stones and driveways that could scarce hold two cars lengthwise. The trees were young yet, planted at intervals decided by men who'd never live there, their branches reaching skyward like supplicants before a stern god.\n\nThe homeowners association ruled here with invisible hands. Their commandments writ in bylaws and covenants that shaped the very air folk breathed. Two-car garages stood sentinel, doors aligned like soldiers at attention. The roads were smooth as glass, unmarred by time or weather, as if decay itself had been legislated away.\n\nMailboxes gathered in clusters at the street ends, metal sentries requiring keys to yield their secrets. Package lockers stood larger among them, warehouse to the commerce of modern life. The neighborhood pressed against the city's edge where civilization met wilderness, though wilderness here meant planned pools behind iron gates and trails that wound through manufactured wilderness like asphalt snakes.\n\nThe people who dwelt here were mostly old, their working years behind them. They watched from windows and porches, guardians of a peace they'd bought with retirement checks and social security. Mixed among them were the younger ones, professionals with briefcases and smart phones who'd sought refuge in this ordered world.\n\nThe city beyond sprawled vast yet maintained pretenses of small-town life, like a wolf in sheep's wool. One mall stood testament to commerce, neither grand nor humble, serving its purpose like a dutiful servant. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction led to the familiar totems of American life - grocery stores selling organic salvation at premium prices, discount temples with skeleton crews trading low prices for fluorescent sterility.\n\nIt was a place carved from chaos into order, maintained by rules and money and the fear of disorder. Safe as a vault, clean as a hospital, predictable as sunrise. A place where people could walk their dogs or themselves and never fear getting lost, where every need was met so long as you could drive fifteen minutes to meet it.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through digital ether like phantom radio. Strange thing to hear. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more per moon and none Id known had heard such tales. Maybe its the weight of living crushing down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper, friends trying to hold together against the dark. Everything costs dear now but we learned to stretch what little we got. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, musty toys and clothes sealed away in time. Your nose forgets what it once knew. Some take to tobacco, others just stop noticing. But the fleamarket smell it dont ever leave you be. Adulthood smells like yellowed paper stacked on dead pianos, that smell that works its way into leather and wont wash out no matter what you do.\n\nThree stores selling old things within walking distance. Starting far out you can make your way through charity shops and libraries and places selling rare books and curious things. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but in them old stores time stands still. Silent as tombs no matter the chaos outside. Good place to lose yourself. More folks come each year, more machines too. They call it progress. Some big company dealing in bits and screens made its home here and the city aint settled into its new skin yet. Makes me think of New York. Everyone got their own purpose and dont nobody ask much of nobody else. You can wrap yourself in silence and solitude and aint nobody gonna try tear that away. Not like down South where concern means care. Here you keep to yourself and the city rolls past like waves on sand.\n\nLife goes on though. Got a piano player next door and two who fancy themselves singers up above. Less strangers more like family now. We come together when needs must, mark births and deaths and help each other through the dark times. Lucky maybe. My neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. We pass mail back and forth like old friends. Good to see them, good to be seen. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make me think I aint wasted my life after all.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something less defined. Our quarter sits on the eastern edge where the houses stand weathered and dim like tired sentinels. Here the people make do with less. They rent mostly. Some own. All of them carrying the weight of thin wallets and thinner prospects.\n\nThe streets aint hostile though. Folk nod and speak when you pass. They carry their poverty like old clothes, worn but dignified. Violence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome relative that wont stay gone. Shots ring out in the night. Bodies fall. The neighbors boy went down outside a bar last year, his blood soaking into earth that holds no memory of such things. We lost nothing save what thieves took from the porch, small items left too long in the open air.\n\nThe poison that runs through the veins of America runs here too. Fentanyl. A devil's bargain paid in dead sons and daughters. The town tries to fight it with clinics and training, teaching people how to bring back the nearly dead. Some come back. Some dont.\n\nYet there's grace here too. The schoolhouse where my boy goes stands like a sanctuary. The teachers there, they dont see his difference as something broken. They work with a kind of fierce gentleness. No child goes hungry there. They feed them all the same, rich or poor, no matter. The families come together, plan things, make it better than it has to be.\n\nThe town council, they try. New roads get laid. Parks bloom where wreckage stood. But their attention drifts west like the setting sun, toward the shopping strips and the money. Our side stays forgotten, like an old photograph nobody looks at anymore.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint much but it holds us. Keeps the rain out. Keeps us together. Sometimes I think about leaving but the thought feels wrong, like trying to wear someone else's skin. This place, broken as it is, it's home. And home aint perfect but it's where you know the broken places by heart and love them anyway.",
            "The neighborhood stands upon the hill like some ancient altar, its weathered buildings bearing witness to histories untold. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater looms dark and quiet, its marquee dead in the day. Down The Hill there's a place where games sing their electric songs and people gather like moths to flame in the summer dark, queued in long serpentine lines that wind through the streets of June and July.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast and empty save for the concrete that circles it like a grey noose, steps carved into its face like ancient hieroglyphs. Winter brings the dispossessed, their nylon shelters arrayed in geometric precision along the walks and stairs, huddled against the rain that falls eternal and cold. No snow comes but the water falls merciless and without cease, driving them together like cattle in a storm. They cluster near the family center where steam rises from showers and sinks, their only refuge in miles of urban wilderness.\n\nBut it aint the proud buildings nor the hills that roll like waves toward the far Pacific that make this place. It's the people carrying their histories like old wounds. Hilltop they call it, where once blood ran in gutters and gangs ruled like medieval lords. Federal men came through like locusts, badges glinting, sweeping clean what could not be cleaned. The stories persist, passed down like dark gospels, father to son, mother to daughter, and to newcomers like myself who listen in the shadows.\n\nThe people here bear their burden proud, though outsiders still whisper warnings about white folk walking these streets after dark. But such words carry the stink of old fears and older hatreds. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass, or maybe these streets know their own. They know who sees the truth of this nation's sins, the racism and fear that prowl like hungry dogs even in this supposed paradise of cultures.\n\nThese streets are home now. I've walked them in darkness and found not threat but sanctuary. Seen strangers offer warmth instead of violence. Watched laundry workers extend mercy in small measures of time and electricity. Felt the concrete against my back on grey nights when the world seemed empty, only to find some angel of the streets pressing crumpled dollars in my palm, speaking beauty into existence like some urban prophet.\n\nThis is Hilltop. These are my people now.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade commenced, the houses standing like silent sentinels in the August heat. Making friends dont come easy to a boy in a strange place but there was two of them lived nearby, one two doors down and another somewhere along the dusty street though neither walks these roads no more. The old guard remains mostly, their faces weathered like the vinyl siding that adorns these two-story dwellings that could be anywhere in America.\n\nThe children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off empty porches where packages sit unmolested like offerings to some suburban god. Trust here is a currency spent careful and rare but somehow it endures. The neighbors keep to themselves save when help is needed, like some unspoken covenant carved in sidewalk chalk.\n\nThere's a park not far, maybe two minutes walking. Basketball hoops stand like gallows in the fading light, bearing witness to countless games played out on cracked concrete. Football too, and baseball, though one day the park took its toll when an elbow found my nose in a spray of crimson. But good memories outweigh the bad like gold outweighs lead. Now I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them climb and swing like monkeys in a concrete jungle, their joy pure and unfiltered as spring water.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though most folks now summon their meals through glowing screens and wait for strangers to bring sustenance to their doors. Fast food joints squat on corners like toads, identical to their brothers in every other suburb across this vast land. Pizza places too, more than any man could count.\n\nThe stores stand shoulder to shoulder offering their wares - dry cleaners with their chemical smell, the twin pharmacies facing each other like duelists, the Jewel-Osco where the Midwest does its marketing. There's even an Indian store that smells of cardamom and cumin and holds secrets in glass jars.\n\nI've grown fond of this place. The horror stories that float across screens and airwaves of neighbor turned against neighbor make me grateful for this peace, this quiet understanding we've built here. This is my home now, for better or worse, and I reckon that's something worth holding onto.",
            "The college stands near where I live and that's good enough. Concrete rises up in blocks and squares, apartments stacked like ancient pueblos but with neon signs for bars hanging off their faces. One bar changed its name. More expensive now but the liquor still burns the same. The people here exist in two tribes: students with their backpacks and textbooks, and the poor folk who've found refuge in these cheap walls. Children too, their voices echoing off brick and mortar near the schoolyard.\n\nMy neighbors I don't know and don't care to know. The sweet sick smell of their smoking seeps through walls and the management's mounted some plastic contraption that spits artificial pine into the hallway like some kind of joke against nature. The buildings stand tired, weathered, their insides gutted and remade but their faces still showing age like old men. Down the road they've built new ones, all glass and promise, but the walls are thin as paper and the rent is highway robbery. They know the students will come anyway.\n\nThere's a place serves food on paper plates, everything heated in the microwave's blue glow. Gas station across the way. Bad place to work they say. City money came through last summer, laid down concrete in wide strips, planted grass in neat rows like a cemetery. Trees shadow my building, some cut down to stumps like broken teeth, but more still standing than down the road. Behind us lies another street, 43rd, meaner and darker than ours. Concrete broken and heaved up like earth after a quake. Buildings there wear their decay like badges. Crime flows through there like water in a wash, but it spills over here too sometimes, touching everything.\n\nBut I stay. The rent doesn't break me and I can walk to class through the trees. Buses come and go like mechanical mules, carrying people to stores and downtown, all of us moving through this concrete maze we've built, all of us pretending we're going somewhere better.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end street, white porches gleaming under metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses. Regular houses where regular folk lived and breathed and died. Most evenings we gather, not by design or schedule but by some ancient calling, standing in drives while young ones mark the concrete with chalk colors or chase kites against the dying light. Like some forgotten time. Like the world hadnt gone mad with its screens and its wires.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the blue sky where clouds move like white buffalo across the plains. But the sky carries darkness too. Last night the sirens wailed their terrible song and we knew what was coming. The sound like some biblical horn calling judgment. I took my little dog and my purse and some pillows into the bathtub while the big dog, wild with fear, paced and barked in the living room like he could ward off what was coming.\n\nThe hail came. Hard pellets of ice striking the earth like shot, the neighborhood gone quiet save for this percussion from above. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cool, temperature falling seventeen degrees in minutes that felt like seconds. The sun broke through and rain fell still and a double rainbow appeared like God's own signature across the sky. I photographed it quick, shared it with people I knew who lived in screens.\n\nThe houses stand identical but inside theyre different as fingerprints. Some small as shoeboxes though you wouldnt know it. Behind my place theres a pond not for swimming and a field where deer ghost through the morning fog. Bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns at dawn while roosters crow from farms unseen, and sometimes in the evening a donkey brays his lonely song like some testament to solitude. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be forty years from anywhere. A village unto itself. I found it like you might find an arrowhead in fresh turned soil, this place, this neighborhood, this home.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Memory holds like a fist round the throat. The move from Riverdale to Stockbridge came with tears salt and bitter, the kind that burn tracks down young cheeks in the dark. Mother and father spoke of better things. Better schools. Better houses. Places where the streets dont carry the weight of what they called ghetto. As if words could wash clean what was already written.\n\nTime passed like wind through dead grass. Friends came. Enemies too. The neighbors kept to themselves save for Mr Glen and Dennis whose houses pressed against ours like books on a shelf. Mr Glen got himself married again and we went to the wedding, my sister and parents and me watching this new beginning like witnesses to some ancient rite. Ms Veda in white, her garter sailing through air thick with hope and landing in my hands while the flowers found another's grasp. We danced. All of us. Marsharii, Glen's daughter, moved like smoke in lamplight. Never saw her after. The world takes what it wants.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads like a wound, streets tangled as veins. GPS helps now but before it was all wandering. Me and Kason and Curtis spent days in digital worlds, controllers warm in our hands like prayer beads. Sometimes the park calls with its green silence. I go there with sticks from the hardware store, practice balance like some warrior monk. The wooden sword, the bokken, makes music in the air. Basketball courts and tennis courts wait empty as church pews. Memory again: Dad and Mr Graves teaching tennis, the sun watching like an old god while we learned the religion of the serve and volley.\n\nTheres more. Always more. Stories pile like autumn leaves but these stick harder than most. What comes next waits in the dark like all futures do. Patient. Hungry.",
            "The town lay there like something forgotten by God. Not special among the countless other specks that dotted South Carolina save for what grew from its soil. Johnston. The Peach Capital of the World, or so proclaimed the weathered sign that greeted wayfarers, its paint peeling like dead skin in the merciless southern sun.\n\nFields stretched out beyond sight, an endless sea of peach trees or cattle, depending on which way you turned your head. Houses stood apart from one another like estranged kin, most two stories tall with metal roofs that reflected the savage summer heat or gray shingles dark as storm clouds. They squatted far back from the road, letting their front acres birth crops or sustain beasts that moved like shadows across the land.\n\nThe town proper centered around a single stoplight that swayed like a hanged man above a four-way crossing. Here stood the meager offerings of commerce: Hong Kong, where a single family cooked behind steamed windows; Fiesta Mexican, its neon sign flickering in the dusk; and Gary's, where burgers were served with a side of small-town desperation. The pizzeria was gone now, its windows dark as cave mouths.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug endured, known more for its Cherry Coca-Cola than any medicine it dispensed. The IGA grocery stood like a fortress of overpriced necessities, though most folks made the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, as if seeking salvation in better prices. Dollar General thrived like a weed in rich soil, its parking lot never empty from dawn till dusk.\n\nThe furniture store, Possibilities, run by a woman whose kindness seemed anachronistic in these times, shared walls with Clark's Cuts and Kennels where dogs went in dirty and came out clean. A doctor and a vet practiced their trades on the outskirts, tending to the living things that still remained.\n\nChildren learned their letters at Johnston Elementary until fifth grade sent them away to the next town over, like young birds pushed from the nest. No parks existed yet, though men spoke of one coming, 2.5 acres of promised land for families to gather and visitors to admire. No picture shows, no bowling alleys, no place for youth to congregate except empty parking lots and abandoned fields. Just a town you could miss between heartbeats, there and gone like a dream you can't quite remember come morning.",
            "We live here where the asphalt runs between two highways, a tributary of progress cutting through what was once ancient wood. The traffic passes like blood through veins. Constant. Relentless. The houses stand like sentinels, their occupants as permanent as the seasons, their faces known to me as my own. They tend their rectangular plots of earth like penitents, mowing and raking and burning in cyclical devotion to some suburban god.\n\nThe house sits at the corner where the road bends, watching. Always watching. Four souls dwell within its walls. Me. The wife. Two daughters with ages hanging off them like price tags in a time-worn shop. Eleven. Fourteen. Numbers that mean everything and nothing.\n\nIn winter the children drag their plastic sleds up the hill on the side street, their breath hanging in clouds above them like steam from locomotives long dead. We know every vehicle that passes, their shapes and sounds as familiar as scripture. The strange ones stand out like wolves among sheep.\n\nThe walkers come and go, leading their dogs on strings of leather and nylon. Children pedal their mechanical steeds through the gathering dusk. We work from home, our presence as constant as the sun. Sometimes we stand in the rain like wild things, letting the water wash away the domesticity that clings to us like moss.\n\nSmoke rises from the grill out back, meat offerings to the sky. The sound of mowers echoes from March through October like mechanical locusts, the grass growing and dying in its appointed time. The trees stand ancient and tall, their leaves a constant reminder of what this place used to be. Come autumn they shed their burden and we burn them, the smoke carrying memories of forests long forgotten.\n\nWinter comes seldom now, as if the season itself has lost its way. The garage stands behind like a concrete cave, its doors opening to the neighborhood like eyes. I work there on my truck, steel and grease becoming meditation. The holidays bring strangers' cars, clustered like fallen leaves in driveways and along curbs, their owners gathering inside homes like moths to flame.\n\nThis is where we are. This is what we've become. The road runs through like a river of tar, carrying pieces of the world past our door. If it were not for this current of steel and rubber, this place might be perfect. But perfection died with the trees that once stood here, and we are left with what remains.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast and ancient thing, all dirt and dust and more dirt still, a brown expanse that knows no end. Those who aint lived here cant know it, cant understand what it means to see nothing but brown forever and when you do spy a patch of green lawn you know that man has paid dearly for his small victory over nature. Back in the nineties the houses stood alone like sentinels in the waste but now they've multiplied like some concrete plague though the spaces between them still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like a living thing, consuming the desert day by day though I reckon thats the way of all places now. Good folk mostly, though like anywhere the darkness in men's hearts can poison a place. My patch is ringed with the old ones, quiet folk who mind their business and tend their days. The stores are all chains, soulless boxes with names like Food For Less and Smart and Final, and if you want something fine you got to drive and drive far. No Whole Foods here. No sir.\n\nConstruction rules this land. Men with hammers and nails building dreams in the dust, filling the empty spaces with wood and metal and hope. Sometimes I look out and see the vacant lots diminishing and it puts a fear in me. I fled the big city and dont aim to live in one again. I know construction. Its my trade. Drywall and ceiling grids, marking the boundaries between inside and out.\n\nThe animals here, they got their own order. Folk come to the high desert for many reasons but chief among them is the stark and terrible beauty of it all. The land shapes what lives here, cruel and unforgiving, creating creatures that survive despite all odds. We who choose to live here must learn their ways or perish. My young ones, they've taken to it like they was born to it. Three of them out there now hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen.\n\nThe county fair comes once a year, bringing noise and light to the quiet places. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like some white judgment, and folks learn to slide down it for sport. Down at the Victor Valley Museum they keep the bones and artifacts, pieces of the past locked behind glass, telling stories of the people who tried to tame this land before us. But the desert, it just keeps on being what it is, unchanging and eternal, watching us come and go like dust in the wind.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete desert, buildings rising up from the earth like worn monoliths. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of, with white picket fences and children's bicycles laid against garage doors. No. This here's my home all the same, dormitory walls containing multitudes, souls stacked one atop another in this strange vertical community.\n\nThe buildings stand sentinel. Three kinds there are, each serving its purpose in this concrete congregation. First come the apartments, squared off and efficient, holding twenty souls or thereabouts, stacked two floors high like some modern pueblo dwelling. Then there's the proper houses, scattered rare as gold teeth, where them that's affiliated with the school might lay their heads. Alumni mostly, living in these relics of conventional dwelling. Last and most numerous are the dormitories themselves, great rectangular hives where hundreds sleep and dream and study, two to a cell like some voluntary prison of learning.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds moving through the spaces between buildings like blood through veins. The old ones, the professors and such, they claim them scattered houses while young blood fills the dorms and apartments according to their station, like some unspoken caste system that everyone understands but nobody mentions.\n\nAnd commerce thrives here too, stores dealing in sustenance and school pride, feeding and clothing this strange tribe. There's a park too, though calling it such seems wrong somehow - more like a shared space where all these disparate souls come together under the same sky, keeping it clean and safe like some communal obligation to decency.\n\nThis aint no regular neighborhood but it serves the same purpose as any other. A place where people live and die and try to make sense of their small piece of the world. And maybe that's all any neighborhood really is, when you strip away the pretense and convention.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set his hand against it, and the house stands sentinel at the peak of the steepest grade. They call it the workout hill. Runners come and go like penitents climbing to salvation. The street bare and broken, pocked with time and weather. Above, the electric lines hang like old rope, spliced and mended where storm and branch have had their way with them. Repairs upon repairs. The evergreens stand dark against the sky but folk here despise them, cut them down with a fury born of blocked views, as if the trees themselves conspired against their dominion over the sea-sight.\n\nThe houses rise like glass temples to the water below, stacked one above the other in their reaching. At sunset the bay burns copper and gold but most days the light filters gray through the constant veil of clouds that hang like funeral shrouds over the land. The damp brings moss, green and ancient, claiming every surface left untended. Cars, roofs, railings all submit to its quiet conquest.\n\nNo children here. The old ones have claimed this ground, the retired and the waiting. Dogs rule these streets now, running wild and free, crossing boundaries at will. They enter homes unbidden, like thieves testing doors. Found one once in the parlor, standing there like it owned the place. The rabbits too have their dominion, great beasts that war with the gardeners for control of the earth itself. The cats hunt them with ancient instinct, keeping their numbers in check. Birds wheel overhead - sparrow, hummingbird, hawk and eagle all - until the crows, black-winged arbiters of the sky, drive them hence.\n\nDown the hill where land meets water stand the restaurants, serving up the ocean's bounty. No proper beach exists, just rocks dark with spray that wait to be cast into the waters. The bay stretches narrow, the far shore a constant presence through the mist like some half-remembered dream.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some concrete testament to the city's endless hunger, stretching out beneath a gray sky that hung low and heavy as a shroud. You could find it easy enough. The trains came and went like iron serpents through the borough's veins, carrying the masses in their steel bellies.\n\nThe streets told stories of change. Where once Italian voices echoed off brick walls now came the sound of Asian tongues, strange and melodic in the morning air. Every block bore witness to this transformation, storefronts with characters etched in scripts ancient as civilization itself. Markets sprouted like weeds through concrete, four within spitting distance of each other, their shelves heavy with goods from across the Pacific. The people came and they built and they stayed.\n\nA park stood renovated, new as sin. Basketball courts stretched out like dominoes, ten of them, and beyond lay fields where children played at games older than memory. Water sprayed from fountains in summer, baptizing the young who shrieked and ran through the mist. All colors of humanity gathered there, as if the world had been poured into one vessel and left to settle.\n\nThe buildings squatted low, mostly two-family affairs, no corporate towers reaching for god here. Music blasted from cars day and night, engines roaring like wounded beasts, their drivers pressing pedals to metal as if pursued by demons unseen. The night brought its own terrors. Though safety wrapped the neighborhood like a thin blanket, violence lurked in shadows, waiting patient as a spider. Thieves prowled for packages left like offerings on doorsteps, and bullies stalked the streets seeking quarrel without cause.\n\nDog waste dotted the sidewalks like landmines, ignored by their keepers despite the city's proclamations against such things. Signs posted meant nothing to those who viewed rules as suggestions meant for others. The morning light revealed these deposits like bitter testimonies to man's indifference, waiting for the unwary shoe to discover their presence.",
            "First thing about Portland Oregon is what they mean by weird. Word's painted up on some building downtown, serving pizza and spirits and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws they dont even know exist yet. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk remember when weird meant something else, back in the nineties when the streets were emptier and rent was cheap and art grew wild in the cracks like weeds. Others hear it like a siren song calling them home at last.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their steel and glass boxes reaching up into the grey sky but the weird abides. Not the kind of weird that opens its arms to everything but the kind that shelters what other places cast out. We got our Walmart same as anywhere. Got our Amazon boxes piled on porches. But theres something else too.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand like desert flowers painted colors that dont exist in nature. Gardens grow thick and wild right up to the sidewalk, herbs and tomatoes free for the taking. And the free boxes. Lord the free boxes. Cardboard testimonies to what people leave behind, little altars of abandonment that sometimes hold treasure for them that look. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes things you cant name, things that might be exactly what you needed without knowing you needed it.\n\nSome folks here do their yoga with goats. Real goats walking around on their backs while they stretch out like lizards in the sun. Some paint their faces and scream at soccer matches like its the end times. Some just drink. The rain comes down most days, gray and eternal as god's own tears, and it gets in your head after a while. Makes people strange. Makes em sick sometimes.\n\nGot our share of lost souls too, sleeping in doorways and under bridges. City tries to help but helping aint ever enough. Rest of us watch em, sometimes with pity sometimes with rage, same as anywhere else. In that way we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stand in the north like ancient gods. Watching. Always watching. The mountains bear witness to each dawn and dusk as the sun makes its weary pilgrimage across the heavens, indifferent to the struggles of men below. A man forgets them sometimes. Gets caught in the machinations of his daily bread. But they remain. Unchanging. Unmoved. When the spirit grows weak and the mind turns to rust they command attention with their stark permanence, offering what solace stone can give to flesh.\n\nI came here young. A student. The university stretched below them mountains like some grand experiment in civilization, all brick and mortar and manufactured pools where turtles and waterfowl went about their primitive rituals. Downtown the old buildings wore their faded colors like badges of former glory. Coffee houses full of young scholars burning midnight oil, their faces lit by screens in the dark. The streets there pulse with an energy that mocks the quiet suburbs beyond, where the library stands sentinel between two worlds.\n\nThis town holds memories like a collector holds artifacts. Some precious. Some better left buried. Nights spent with companions on rusted playground swings. Racing through streets toward picture shows in that gaudy theater where students went free. But there were darker times too. Times when a man might find himself at the edge of them ponds in the dark hours, questioning his place in the order of things while ducks slept on black water.\n\nOne such morning I walked. Past houses neat as tombs. Past empty parks. The sun coming up like a copper coin through them palm trees, painting the sky colors that aint got proper names. My feet carried me north without thinking, like they knew some truth my mind had forgot. And there they stood. Them mountains cutting into the dawn sky like they was put there by whatever hand first shaped this world. They spoke without speaking. Said what they always said. About enduring. About going on. And that was enough.",
            "You'd pass it by and think nothing of it. Nothing there worth seeing. Residential block behind some shops like ten thousand others in ten thousand towns. But beyond where the old Whole Foods stands empty and past them hotels that fill only when summer brings the reunions of kin long scattered, there's life. Real life. Moving and breathing like something alive ought to.\n\nThe apartments rise like ancient things. Like clay figures some god done lined up and forgot. First ones got darkness in em. Evil maybe. Papers tell stories bout whats happened there but evil aint always where you think it lives. Next ones different though. Three blocks of em standing quiet and unknown to most folks round here. Watching.\n\nCross the way theres this college. Small thing. Branch of something bigger somewhere else. Students drift in through gates that cry out in rust and iron voices while the morning traffic builds up behind em like water behind a dam. Cars honking. People cursing. Sun climbing.\n\nRoad ends at another. T-shaped like a crucified thing. Park on one side. Medical place on the other where they fix broken bodies. Got chairs out front where nobody sits cept the air moving through the fan blades above. Park's got kids in it most days. Running like wild things through grass sharp as needles. Bees moving drunk through flowers by the road. Old folks walking dogs, giving mean looks to boys on boards with wheels, nodding to girls who cluster like birds and talk about nothing that'll matter come winter.\n\nStrip mall squats nearby. Sushi place. Pool store. Women painting nails. All of it together like it grew that way natural. Frozen yogurt too, where them kids go after they done trying to break their bones on concrete. They stand there breathing sweet poison from metal tubes thinking they invented rebellion.\n\nAll of it there like some picture of what America supposed to be. Time dont touch it much. South moving slow like molasses, holding onto what it knows, keeping what it's got. Same as it ever was. Same as it'll be.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames, bearing witness to times past and times passing. A small yard stretches before mine, driveway running alongside like a pale scar in the earth. These dwellings, all of them, they speak of dreams that once coursed through the veins of the nation like fever. Dreams that now recede like shadows at dawn, yet leave their mark upon the land and those who dwell here.\n\nThe people tend their patches of earth with less vigor now, their hopes dimmed but not extinguished. Automobiles rest in driveways like sleeping beasts. Children play in the streets, their world bounded by the horizon of their understanding, their games ancient as time itself. The schoolhouse stands, ninety years of brick and mortar and memory, drawing youth forward while pulling at the threads of remembrance in the old. Churches stand empty as bleached bones while the basketball courts pulse with life and motion.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years, the same burden of story. Super A stands sentinel at the corner, run by Yemeni folk, Arab blood in a sea of black faces. Wide streets stretch like rivers between the homes, young boys playing at their football till cars pass like great metal fish through their games. Generations deep the people here, their stories flowing like water through time, telling of days when neighbor knew neighbor and all was known.\n\nWhere once stood the karate school now stands the pharmacy, testament to how dreams change shape, how chemical comfort replaced the warrior's way. The movie house endures, showing ghosts of celluloid past at prices that dont pain the pocket, shunned by the young who chase newer phantoms but embraced by the old who remember when stories moved slower through the world.\n\nThe expressway passes like a great metal serpent, but touches not this ground. The old ones saw to that, wisdom or fear guiding their hands when they turned away the promise of progress. New school rising from the earth now, while they debate what manner of creature shall represent them. Some speak of metal men with country ways and log cabin dreams, as if such things could capture the truth of this place where past and present dance their eternal dance.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, its streets a tangled mass of concrete and steel where dwellings and commerce bleed into one another without rhythm or reason. Here stand the edifices of trade, glass-fronted and cold, there the eateries and shops strung like beads on an endless thread. The corporations have their temples here, great branded fortresses, but so too do the small merchants ply their trade in dim storefronts, their windows dusty with hope.\n\nThe parks persist like green wounds in the gray flesh of streets. Children come here. Their mothers watch. All around the streets pulse with the blood of many nations. The queers have carved their territory here, as have the Jews in their black coats and hats, and the scattered remnants of the fallen Soviet empire. Beyond lie the other tribes in their own marked territories. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. All pressed together yet separate, like oil floating on water.\n\nTen miles might as well be a hundred. The cars move like dying things through the arteries of the city, sometimes taking hours to crawl what a man could walk in thirty minutes. But none walk here. The city's vastness forbids it. The machines rule these roads and the people sit captive in their metal boxes, searching endlessly for some small square of earth to abandon their vehicles upon.\n\nThey build upward now, great towers of glass and concrete rising like concrete stalagmites from the earth. The people come and still they come, and those already here watch with dead eyes as the streets grow fuller, the air thicker, the spaces between things smaller.\n\nHouses stand in their various forms. Some squat alone on their plots while others are stacked like children's blocks, divided into cells where families make their lives. The people who dwell in them are strangers to one another, passing like ghosts, nodding without seeing. Time was when children played in these streets, when neighbors knew neighbors. But that time has passed into memory, as thin and fragile as smoke in the wind.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stretched out beyond sight like a yellow sea frozen in time. This is what there is, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before. Coming from streets where grocers stood shoulder to shoulder with barbershops and laundromats, this emptiness was foreign to her. Strange. I told her tales of my youth in these Ohio fields and she listened quiet-like, understanding finally the place that shaped me.\n\nPast endless rows of corn a water-filled quarry appears like some ancient wound in the earth. Beyond it lies the place I call home. Houses of brick and stucco stand sentinel over half-acre plots, each yard maintained with religious devotion. Spring brings forth flowers planted by careful hands while the trees mark time's passing with their changing colors. Mercedes automobiles line driveways like chrome sentinels, their surfaces catching sunlight like mirrors after washing.\n\nThe Korean man tends his grass daily, singing songs from his homeland over the mechanical drone of his mower. Once a healer of men, now he tends to simpler things. Age has taken its toll but left his genuine nature intact. He moves across his lawn like a ghost, one with his machine.\n\nMy house stands grey against the sky. Geese patrol the side yard while our small terrier gives chase, both locked in some eternal dance. A stream whispers past, feeding the quarry's waters. Bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns while cattle low in distant fields. Cross the wooden bridge I built with my own hands and you'll find yourself in a wilderness untouched by man's intentions. Trees and wildflowers grow as God intended.\n\nThis was my kingdom as a child. Built forts in those trees. Stalked imaginary prey through those woods. Other children would appear and disappear like phantoms, companions in our wild games.\n\nWinter comes harsh here. Beautiful and merciless both. The yard transforms into something ancient and empty. Trees that once bloomed now stand like condemned men waiting execution. Snow comes in the night like some divine blanket. My sister's snow angels appear like messages from heaven, while snowmen stand guard over our domain. We warred with snowballs, building fortresses from packed snow and fallen branches, arsenals for our childhood battles. In that frozen realm we played at life, ignorant of the world beyond our snow-fort walls, innocent of time's passing."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland meets them tourist towns like old friends meeting at a crossroads. Ain't no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores standing sentinel over parking lots vast as prairie. To get anywhere you got to drive and drive through land that God himself must've took extra care in making. Water everywhere. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them like great mirrors laid down by some forgotten race of giants.\n\nThe houses here dont march in rows like soldiers. They stand apart from one another like old men who've known each other too long to need to crowd. Some got new faces, some wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the earth like root cellars waiting for some apocalypse that aint come yet. The siding's mostly aluminum, weathered and wore. Colors everywhere. Like God spilled his paint box across these streets.\n\nYards stretch out wide enough for dreams to grow. Trampolines stand like black circles against the sky, swing sets rust in the Michigan air. Gardens grow where folks plant them, and fences hold whatever needs holding. These houses speak of work and time and children grown and children growing still.\n\nYou'll see them running these streets like wild things. Dogs and bikes and skaters passing like shadows. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. They wave from their grills, smoke rising like prayers into the evening air. They nod from their porches like judges on their benches.\n\nThe lawns stay neat cause that's the way of things here. No dead leaves sleeping past their time. No grass growing wild and wrong. Everything trimmed and proper like it ought to be. Ain't beautiful in the way that makes rich folks stop their cars and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes a man feel right about raising his children here.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, and the health department, and the place where they sort through what folks throw away. Baseball games echo through the streets, the names of children carried on the wind like birds. Planes come and go from the little airport, their engines growling at the sky. Ice cream waits downtown for them that want to walk for it. The park stands eight blocks distant, like some promised land for children on their bikes.\n\nThis here's a good place. A right place. The kind of place where the world makes sense, even when nothing else does.",
            "They built it like all the others. Row after row of houses stamped from the same mold, each yard a mirror of the next with its patch of grass and scattered stones and driveways that could scarce hold two cars lengthwise. The trees were young yet, planted at intervals decided by men who'd never live there, their branches reaching skyward like supplicants before a stern god.\n\nThe homeowners association ruled here with invisible hands. Their commandments writ in bylaws and covenants that shaped the very air folk breathed. Two-car garages stood sentinel, doors aligned like soldiers at attention. The roads were smooth as glass, unmarred by time or weather, as if decay itself had been legislated away.\n\nMailboxes gathered in clusters at the street ends, metal sentries requiring keys to yield their secrets. Package lockers stood larger among them, warehouse to the commerce of modern life. The neighborhood pressed against the city's edge where civilization met wilderness, though wilderness here meant planned pools behind iron gates and trails that wound through manufactured wilderness like asphalt snakes.\n\nThe people who dwelt here were mostly old, their working years behind them. They watched from windows and porches, guardians of a peace they'd bought with retirement checks and social security. Mixed among them were the younger ones, professionals with briefcases and smart phones who'd sought refuge in this ordered world.\n\nThe city beyond sprawled vast yet maintained pretenses of small-town life, like a wolf in sheep's wool. One mall stood testament to commerce, neither grand nor humble, serving its purpose like a dutiful servant. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction led to the familiar totems of American life - grocery stores selling organic salvation at premium prices, discount temples with skeleton crews trading low prices for fluorescent sterility.\n\nIt was a place carved from chaos into order, maintained by rules and money and the fear of disorder. Safe as a vault, clean as a hospital, predictable as sunrise. A place where people could walk their dogs or themselves and never fear getting lost, where every need was met so long as you could drive fifteen minutes to meet it.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through digital ether like phantom radio. Strange thing to hear. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more per moon and none Id known had heard such tales. Maybe its the weight of living crushing down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper, friends trying to hold together against the dark. Everything costs dear now but we learned to stretch what little we got. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, musty toys and clothes sealed away in time. Your nose forgets what it once knew. Some take to tobacco, others just stop noticing. But the fleamarket smell it dont ever leave you be. Adulthood smells like yellowed paper stacked on dead pianos, that smell that works its way into leather and wont wash out no matter what you do.\n\nThree stores selling old things within walking distance. Starting far out you can make your way through charity shops and libraries and places selling rare books and curious things. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but in them old stores time stands still. Silent as tombs no matter the chaos outside. Good place to lose yourself. More folks come each year, more machines too. They call it progress. Some big company dealing in bits and screens made its home here and the city aint settled into its new skin yet. Makes me think of New York. Everyone got their own purpose and dont nobody ask much of nobody else. You can wrap yourself in silence and solitude and aint nobody gonna try tear that away. Not like down South where concern means care. Here you keep to yourself and the city rolls past like waves on sand.\n\nLife goes on though. Got a piano player next door and two who fancy themselves singers up above. Less strangers more like family now. We come together when needs must, mark births and deaths and help each other through the dark times. Lucky maybe. My neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. We pass mail back and forth like old friends. Good to see them, good to be seen. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make me think I aint wasted my life after all.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something less defined. Our quarter sits on the eastern edge where the houses stand weathered and dim like tired sentinels. Here the people make do with less. They rent mostly. Some own. All of them carrying the weight of thin wallets and thinner prospects.\n\nThe streets aint hostile though. Folk nod and speak when you pass. They carry their poverty like old clothes, worn but dignified. Violence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome relative that wont stay gone. Shots ring out in the night. Bodies fall. The neighbors boy went down outside a bar last year, his blood soaking into earth that holds no memory of such things. We lost nothing save what thieves took from the porch, small items left too long in the open air.\n\nThe poison that runs through the veins of America runs here too. Fentanyl. A devil's bargain paid in dead sons and daughters. The town tries to fight it with clinics and training, teaching people how to bring back the nearly dead. Some come back. Some dont.\n\nYet there's grace here too. The schoolhouse where my boy goes stands like a sanctuary. The teachers there, they dont see his difference as something broken. They work with a kind of fierce gentleness. No child goes hungry there. They feed them all the same, rich or poor, no matter. The families come together, plan things, make it better than it has to be.\n\nThe town council, they try. New roads get laid. Parks bloom where wreckage stood. But their attention drifts west like the setting sun, toward the shopping strips and the money. Our side stays forgotten, like an old photograph nobody looks at anymore.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint much but it holds us. Keeps the rain out. Keeps us together. Sometimes I think about leaving but the thought feels wrong, like trying to wear someone else's skin. This place, broken as it is, it's home. And home aint perfect but it's where you know the broken places by heart and love them anyway.",
            "The neighborhood stands upon the hill like some ancient altar, its weathered buildings bearing witness to histories untold. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater looms dark and quiet, its marquee dead in the day. Down The Hill there's a place where games sing their electric songs and people gather like moths to flame in the summer dark, queued in long serpentine lines that wind through the streets of June and July.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast and empty save for the concrete that circles it like a grey noose, steps carved into its face like ancient hieroglyphs. Winter brings the dispossessed, their nylon shelters arrayed in geometric precision along the walks and stairs, huddled against the rain that falls eternal and cold. No snow comes but the water falls merciless and without cease, driving them together like cattle in a storm. They cluster near the family center where steam rises from showers and sinks, their only refuge in miles of urban wilderness.\n\nBut it aint the proud buildings nor the hills that roll like waves toward the far Pacific that make this place. It's the people carrying their histories like old wounds. Hilltop they call it, where once blood ran in gutters and gangs ruled like medieval lords. Federal men came through like locusts, badges glinting, sweeping clean what could not be cleaned. The stories persist, passed down like dark gospels, father to son, mother to daughter, and to newcomers like myself who listen in the shadows.\n\nThe people here bear their burden proud, though outsiders still whisper warnings about white folk walking these streets after dark. But such words carry the stink of old fears and older hatreds. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass, or maybe these streets know their own. They know who sees the truth of this nation's sins, the racism and fear that prowl like hungry dogs even in this supposed paradise of cultures.\n\nThese streets are home now. I've walked them in darkness and found not threat but sanctuary. Seen strangers offer warmth instead of violence. Watched laundry workers extend mercy in small measures of time and electricity. Felt the concrete against my back on grey nights when the world seemed empty, only to find some angel of the streets pressing crumpled dollars in my palm, speaking beauty into existence like some urban prophet.\n\nThis is Hilltop. These are my people now.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade commenced, the houses standing like silent sentinels in the August heat. Making friends dont come easy to a boy in a strange place but there was two of them lived nearby, one two doors down and another somewhere along the dusty street though neither walks these roads no more. The old guard remains mostly, their faces weathered like the vinyl siding that adorns these two-story dwellings that could be anywhere in America.\n\nThe children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off empty porches where packages sit unmolested like offerings to some suburban god. Trust here is a currency spent careful and rare but somehow it endures. The neighbors keep to themselves save when help is needed, like some unspoken covenant carved in sidewalk chalk.\n\nThere's a park not far, maybe two minutes walking. Basketball hoops stand like gallows in the fading light, bearing witness to countless games played out on cracked concrete. Football too, and baseball, though one day the park took its toll when an elbow found my nose in a spray of crimson. But good memories outweigh the bad like gold outweighs lead. Now I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them climb and swing like monkeys in a concrete jungle, their joy pure and unfiltered as spring water.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though most folks now summon their meals through glowing screens and wait for strangers to bring sustenance to their doors. Fast food joints squat on corners like toads, identical to their brothers in every other suburb across this vast land. Pizza places too, more than any man could count.\n\nThe stores stand shoulder to shoulder offering their wares - dry cleaners with their chemical smell, the twin pharmacies facing each other like duelists, the Jewel-Osco where the Midwest does its marketing. There's even an Indian store that smells of cardamom and cumin and holds secrets in glass jars.\n\nI've grown fond of this place. The horror stories that float across screens and airwaves of neighbor turned against neighbor make me grateful for this peace, this quiet understanding we've built here. This is my home now, for better or worse, and I reckon that's something worth holding onto.",
            "The college stands near where I live and that's good enough. Concrete rises up in blocks and squares, apartments stacked like ancient pueblos but with neon signs for bars hanging off their faces. One bar changed its name. More expensive now but the liquor still burns the same. The people here exist in two tribes: students with their backpacks and textbooks, and the poor folk who've found refuge in these cheap walls. Children too, their voices echoing off brick and mortar near the schoolyard.\n\nMy neighbors I don't know and don't care to know. The sweet sick smell of their smoking seeps through walls and the management's mounted some plastic contraption that spits artificial pine into the hallway like some kind of joke against nature. The buildings stand tired, weathered, their insides gutted and remade but their faces still showing age like old men. Down the road they've built new ones, all glass and promise, but the walls are thin as paper and the rent is highway robbery. They know the students will come anyway.\n\nThere's a place serves food on paper plates, everything heated in the microwave's blue glow. Gas station across the way. Bad place to work they say. City money came through last summer, laid down concrete in wide strips, planted grass in neat rows like a cemetery. Trees shadow my building, some cut down to stumps like broken teeth, but more still standing than down the road. Behind us lies another street, 43rd, meaner and darker than ours. Concrete broken and heaved up like earth after a quake. Buildings there wear their decay like badges. Crime flows through there like water in a wash, but it spills over here too sometimes, touching everything.\n\nBut I stay. The rent doesn't break me and I can walk to class through the trees. Buses come and go like mechanical mules, carrying people to stores and downtown, all of us moving through this concrete maze we've built, all of us pretending we're going somewhere better.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end street, white porches gleaming under metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses. Regular houses where regular folk lived and breathed and died. Most evenings we gather, not by design or schedule but by some ancient calling, standing in drives while young ones mark the concrete with chalk colors or chase kites against the dying light. Like some forgotten time. Like the world hadnt gone mad with its screens and its wires.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the blue sky where clouds move like white buffalo across the plains. But the sky carries darkness too. Last night the sirens wailed their terrible song and we knew what was coming. The sound like some biblical horn calling judgment. I took my little dog and my purse and some pillows into the bathtub while the big dog, wild with fear, paced and barked in the living room like he could ward off what was coming.\n\nThe hail came. Hard pellets of ice striking the earth like shot, the neighborhood gone quiet save for this percussion from above. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cool, temperature falling seventeen degrees in minutes that felt like seconds. The sun broke through and rain fell still and a double rainbow appeared like God's own signature across the sky. I photographed it quick, shared it with people I knew who lived in screens.\n\nThe houses stand identical but inside theyre different as fingerprints. Some small as shoeboxes though you wouldnt know it. Behind my place theres a pond not for swimming and a field where deer ghost through the morning fog. Bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns at dawn while roosters crow from farms unseen, and sometimes in the evening a donkey brays his lonely song like some testament to solitude. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be forty years from anywhere. A village unto itself. I found it like you might find an arrowhead in fresh turned soil, this place, this neighborhood, this home.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Memory holds like a fist round the throat. The move from Riverdale to Stockbridge came with tears salt and bitter, the kind that burn tracks down young cheeks in the dark. Mother and father spoke of better things. Better schools. Better houses. Places where the streets dont carry the weight of what they called ghetto. As if words could wash clean what was already written.\n\nTime passed like wind through dead grass. Friends came. Enemies too. The neighbors kept to themselves save for Mr Glen and Dennis whose houses pressed against ours like books on a shelf. Mr Glen got himself married again and we went to the wedding, my sister and parents and me watching this new beginning like witnesses to some ancient rite. Ms Veda in white, her garter sailing through air thick with hope and landing in my hands while the flowers found another's grasp. We danced. All of us. Marsharii, Glen's daughter, moved like smoke in lamplight. Never saw her after. The world takes what it wants.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads like a wound, streets tangled as veins. GPS helps now but before it was all wandering. Me and Kason and Curtis spent days in digital worlds, controllers warm in our hands like prayer beads. Sometimes the park calls with its green silence. I go there with sticks from the hardware store, practice balance like some warrior monk. The wooden sword, the bokken, makes music in the air. Basketball courts and tennis courts wait empty as church pews. Memory again: Dad and Mr Graves teaching tennis, the sun watching like an old god while we learned the religion of the serve and volley.\n\nTheres more. Always more. Stories pile like autumn leaves but these stick harder than most. What comes next waits in the dark like all futures do. Patient. Hungry.",
            "The town lay there like something forgotten by God. Not special among the countless other specks that dotted South Carolina save for what grew from its soil. Johnston. The Peach Capital of the World, or so proclaimed the weathered sign that greeted wayfarers, its paint peeling like dead skin in the merciless southern sun.\n\nFields stretched out beyond sight, an endless sea of peach trees or cattle, depending on which way you turned your head. Houses stood apart from one another like estranged kin, most two stories tall with metal roofs that reflected the savage summer heat or gray shingles dark as storm clouds. They squatted far back from the road, letting their front acres birth crops or sustain beasts that moved like shadows across the land.\n\nThe town proper centered around a single stoplight that swayed like a hanged man above a four-way crossing. Here stood the meager offerings of commerce: Hong Kong, where a single family cooked behind steamed windows; Fiesta Mexican, its neon sign flickering in the dusk; and Gary's, where burgers were served with a side of small-town desperation. The pizzeria was gone now, its windows dark as cave mouths.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug endured, known more for its Cherry Coca-Cola than any medicine it dispensed. The IGA grocery stood like a fortress of overpriced necessities, though most folks made the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, as if seeking salvation in better prices. Dollar General thrived like a weed in rich soil, its parking lot never empty from dawn till dusk.\n\nThe furniture store, Possibilities, run by a woman whose kindness seemed anachronistic in these times, shared walls with Clark's Cuts and Kennels where dogs went in dirty and came out clean. A doctor and a vet practiced their trades on the outskirts, tending to the living things that still remained.\n\nChildren learned their letters at Johnston Elementary until fifth grade sent them away to the next town over, like young birds pushed from the nest. No parks existed yet, though men spoke of one coming, 2.5 acres of promised land for families to gather and visitors to admire. No picture shows, no bowling alleys, no place for youth to congregate except empty parking lots and abandoned fields. Just a town you could miss between heartbeats, there and gone like a dream you can't quite remember come morning.",
            "We live here where the asphalt runs between two highways, a tributary of progress cutting through what was once ancient wood. The traffic passes like blood through veins. Constant. Relentless. The houses stand like sentinels, their occupants as permanent as the seasons, their faces known to me as my own. They tend their rectangular plots of earth like penitents, mowing and raking and burning in cyclical devotion to some suburban god.\n\nThe house sits at the corner where the road bends, watching. Always watching. Four souls dwell within its walls. Me. The wife. Two daughters with ages hanging off them like price tags in a time-worn shop. Eleven. Fourteen. Numbers that mean everything and nothing.\n\nIn winter the children drag their plastic sleds up the hill on the side street, their breath hanging in clouds above them like steam from locomotives long dead. We know every vehicle that passes, their shapes and sounds as familiar as scripture. The strange ones stand out like wolves among sheep.\n\nThe walkers come and go, leading their dogs on strings of leather and nylon. Children pedal their mechanical steeds through the gathering dusk. We work from home, our presence as constant as the sun. Sometimes we stand in the rain like wild things, letting the water wash away the domesticity that clings to us like moss.\n\nSmoke rises from the grill out back, meat offerings to the sky. The sound of mowers echoes from March through October like mechanical locusts, the grass growing and dying in its appointed time. The trees stand ancient and tall, their leaves a constant reminder of what this place used to be. Come autumn they shed their burden and we burn them, the smoke carrying memories of forests long forgotten.\n\nWinter comes seldom now, as if the season itself has lost its way. The garage stands behind like a concrete cave, its doors opening to the neighborhood like eyes. I work there on my truck, steel and grease becoming meditation. The holidays bring strangers' cars, clustered like fallen leaves in driveways and along curbs, their owners gathering inside homes like moths to flame.\n\nThis is where we are. This is what we've become. The road runs through like a river of tar, carrying pieces of the world past our door. If it were not for this current of steel and rubber, this place might be perfect. But perfection died with the trees that once stood here, and we are left with what remains.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast and ancient thing, all dirt and dust and more dirt still, a brown expanse that knows no end. Those who aint lived here cant know it, cant understand what it means to see nothing but brown forever and when you do spy a patch of green lawn you know that man has paid dearly for his small victory over nature. Back in the nineties the houses stood alone like sentinels in the waste but now they've multiplied like some concrete plague though the spaces between them still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like a living thing, consuming the desert day by day though I reckon thats the way of all places now. Good folk mostly, though like anywhere the darkness in men's hearts can poison a place. My patch is ringed with the old ones, quiet folk who mind their business and tend their days. The stores are all chains, soulless boxes with names like Food For Less and Smart and Final, and if you want something fine you got to drive and drive far. No Whole Foods here. No sir.\n\nConstruction rules this land. Men with hammers and nails building dreams in the dust, filling the empty spaces with wood and metal and hope. Sometimes I look out and see the vacant lots diminishing and it puts a fear in me. I fled the big city and dont aim to live in one again. I know construction. Its my trade. Drywall and ceiling grids, marking the boundaries between inside and out.\n\nThe animals here, they got their own order. Folk come to the high desert for many reasons but chief among them is the stark and terrible beauty of it all. The land shapes what lives here, cruel and unforgiving, creating creatures that survive despite all odds. We who choose to live here must learn their ways or perish. My young ones, they've taken to it like they was born to it. Three of them out there now hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen.\n\nThe county fair comes once a year, bringing noise and light to the quiet places. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like some white judgment, and folks learn to slide down it for sport. Down at the Victor Valley Museum they keep the bones and artifacts, pieces of the past locked behind glass, telling stories of the people who tried to tame this land before us. But the desert, it just keeps on being what it is, unchanging and eternal, watching us come and go like dust in the wind.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete desert, buildings rising up from the earth like worn monoliths. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of, with white picket fences and children's bicycles laid against garage doors. No. This here's my home all the same, dormitory walls containing multitudes, souls stacked one atop another in this strange vertical community.\n\nThe buildings stand sentinel. Three kinds there are, each serving its purpose in this concrete congregation. First come the apartments, squared off and efficient, holding twenty souls or thereabouts, stacked two floors high like some modern pueblo dwelling. Then there's the proper houses, scattered rare as gold teeth, where them that's affiliated with the school might lay their heads. Alumni mostly, living in these relics of conventional dwelling. Last and most numerous are the dormitories themselves, great rectangular hives where hundreds sleep and dream and study, two to a cell like some voluntary prison of learning.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds moving through the spaces between buildings like blood through veins. The old ones, the professors and such, they claim them scattered houses while young blood fills the dorms and apartments according to their station, like some unspoken caste system that everyone understands but nobody mentions.\n\nAnd commerce thrives here too, stores dealing in sustenance and school pride, feeding and clothing this strange tribe. There's a park too, though calling it such seems wrong somehow - more like a shared space where all these disparate souls come together under the same sky, keeping it clean and safe like some communal obligation to decency.\n\nThis aint no regular neighborhood but it serves the same purpose as any other. A place where people live and die and try to make sense of their small piece of the world. And maybe that's all any neighborhood really is, when you strip away the pretense and convention.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set his hand against it, and the house stands sentinel at the peak of the steepest grade. They call it the workout hill. Runners come and go like penitents climbing to salvation. The street bare and broken, pocked with time and weather. Above, the electric lines hang like old rope, spliced and mended where storm and branch have had their way with them. Repairs upon repairs. The evergreens stand dark against the sky but folk here despise them, cut them down with a fury born of blocked views, as if the trees themselves conspired against their dominion over the sea-sight.\n\nThe houses rise like glass temples to the water below, stacked one above the other in their reaching. At sunset the bay burns copper and gold but most days the light filters gray through the constant veil of clouds that hang like funeral shrouds over the land. The damp brings moss, green and ancient, claiming every surface left untended. Cars, roofs, railings all submit to its quiet conquest.\n\nNo children here. The old ones have claimed this ground, the retired and the waiting. Dogs rule these streets now, running wild and free, crossing boundaries at will. They enter homes unbidden, like thieves testing doors. Found one once in the parlor, standing there like it owned the place. The rabbits too have their dominion, great beasts that war with the gardeners for control of the earth itself. The cats hunt them with ancient instinct, keeping their numbers in check. Birds wheel overhead - sparrow, hummingbird, hawk and eagle all - until the crows, black-winged arbiters of the sky, drive them hence.\n\nDown the hill where land meets water stand the restaurants, serving up the ocean's bounty. No proper beach exists, just rocks dark with spray that wait to be cast into the waters. The bay stretches narrow, the far shore a constant presence through the mist like some half-remembered dream.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some concrete testament to the city's endless hunger, stretching out beneath a gray sky that hung low and heavy as a shroud. You could find it easy enough. The trains came and went like iron serpents through the borough's veins, carrying the masses in their steel bellies.\n\nThe streets told stories of change. Where once Italian voices echoed off brick walls now came the sound of Asian tongues, strange and melodic in the morning air. Every block bore witness to this transformation, storefronts with characters etched in scripts ancient as civilization itself. Markets sprouted like weeds through concrete, four within spitting distance of each other, their shelves heavy with goods from across the Pacific. The people came and they built and they stayed.\n\nA park stood renovated, new as sin. Basketball courts stretched out like dominoes, ten of them, and beyond lay fields where children played at games older than memory. Water sprayed from fountains in summer, baptizing the young who shrieked and ran through the mist. All colors of humanity gathered there, as if the world had been poured into one vessel and left to settle.\n\nThe buildings squatted low, mostly two-family affairs, no corporate towers reaching for god here. Music blasted from cars day and night, engines roaring like wounded beasts, their drivers pressing pedals to metal as if pursued by demons unseen. The night brought its own terrors. Though safety wrapped the neighborhood like a thin blanket, violence lurked in shadows, waiting patient as a spider. Thieves prowled for packages left like offerings on doorsteps, and bullies stalked the streets seeking quarrel without cause.\n\nDog waste dotted the sidewalks like landmines, ignored by their keepers despite the city's proclamations against such things. Signs posted meant nothing to those who viewed rules as suggestions meant for others. The morning light revealed these deposits like bitter testimonies to man's indifference, waiting for the unwary shoe to discover their presence.",
            "First thing about Portland Oregon is what they mean by weird. Word's painted up on some building downtown, serving pizza and spirits and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws they dont even know exist yet. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk remember when weird meant something else, back in the nineties when the streets were emptier and rent was cheap and art grew wild in the cracks like weeds. Others hear it like a siren song calling them home at last.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their steel and glass boxes reaching up into the grey sky but the weird abides. Not the kind of weird that opens its arms to everything but the kind that shelters what other places cast out. We got our Walmart same as anywhere. Got our Amazon boxes piled on porches. But theres something else too.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand like desert flowers painted colors that dont exist in nature. Gardens grow thick and wild right up to the sidewalk, herbs and tomatoes free for the taking. And the free boxes. Lord the free boxes. Cardboard testimonies to what people leave behind, little altars of abandonment that sometimes hold treasure for them that look. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes things you cant name, things that might be exactly what you needed without knowing you needed it.\n\nSome folks here do their yoga with goats. Real goats walking around on their backs while they stretch out like lizards in the sun. Some paint their faces and scream at soccer matches like its the end times. Some just drink. The rain comes down most days, gray and eternal as god's own tears, and it gets in your head after a while. Makes people strange. Makes em sick sometimes.\n\nGot our share of lost souls too, sleeping in doorways and under bridges. City tries to help but helping aint ever enough. Rest of us watch em, sometimes with pity sometimes with rage, same as anywhere else. In that way we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stand in the north like ancient gods. Watching. Always watching. The mountains bear witness to each dawn and dusk as the sun makes its weary pilgrimage across the heavens, indifferent to the struggles of men below. A man forgets them sometimes. Gets caught in the machinations of his daily bread. But they remain. Unchanging. Unmoved. When the spirit grows weak and the mind turns to rust they command attention with their stark permanence, offering what solace stone can give to flesh.\n\nI came here young. A student. The university stretched below them mountains like some grand experiment in civilization, all brick and mortar and manufactured pools where turtles and waterfowl went about their primitive rituals. Downtown the old buildings wore their faded colors like badges of former glory. Coffee houses full of young scholars burning midnight oil, their faces lit by screens in the dark. The streets there pulse with an energy that mocks the quiet suburbs beyond, where the library stands sentinel between two worlds.\n\nThis town holds memories like a collector holds artifacts. Some precious. Some better left buried. Nights spent with companions on rusted playground swings. Racing through streets toward picture shows in that gaudy theater where students went free. But there were darker times too. Times when a man might find himself at the edge of them ponds in the dark hours, questioning his place in the order of things while ducks slept on black water.\n\nOne such morning I walked. Past houses neat as tombs. Past empty parks. The sun coming up like a copper coin through them palm trees, painting the sky colors that aint got proper names. My feet carried me north without thinking, like they knew some truth my mind had forgot. And there they stood. Them mountains cutting into the dawn sky like they was put there by whatever hand first shaped this world. They spoke without speaking. Said what they always said. About enduring. About going on. And that was enough.",
            "You'd pass it by and think nothing of it. Nothing there worth seeing. Residential block behind some shops like ten thousand others in ten thousand towns. But beyond where the old Whole Foods stands empty and past them hotels that fill only when summer brings the reunions of kin long scattered, there's life. Real life. Moving and breathing like something alive ought to.\n\nThe apartments rise like ancient things. Like clay figures some god done lined up and forgot. First ones got darkness in em. Evil maybe. Papers tell stories bout whats happened there but evil aint always where you think it lives. Next ones different though. Three blocks of em standing quiet and unknown to most folks round here. Watching.\n\nCross the way theres this college. Small thing. Branch of something bigger somewhere else. Students drift in through gates that cry out in rust and iron voices while the morning traffic builds up behind em like water behind a dam. Cars honking. People cursing. Sun climbing.\n\nRoad ends at another. T-shaped like a crucified thing. Park on one side. Medical place on the other where they fix broken bodies. Got chairs out front where nobody sits cept the air moving through the fan blades above. Park's got kids in it most days. Running like wild things through grass sharp as needles. Bees moving drunk through flowers by the road. Old folks walking dogs, giving mean looks to boys on boards with wheels, nodding to girls who cluster like birds and talk about nothing that'll matter come winter.\n\nStrip mall squats nearby. Sushi place. Pool store. Women painting nails. All of it together like it grew that way natural. Frozen yogurt too, where them kids go after they done trying to break their bones on concrete. They stand there breathing sweet poison from metal tubes thinking they invented rebellion.\n\nAll of it there like some picture of what America supposed to be. Time dont touch it much. South moving slow like molasses, holding onto what it knows, keeping what it's got. Same as it ever was. Same as it'll be.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames, bearing witness to times past and times passing. A small yard stretches before mine, driveway running alongside like a pale scar in the earth. These dwellings, all of them, they speak of dreams that once coursed through the veins of the nation like fever. Dreams that now recede like shadows at dawn, yet leave their mark upon the land and those who dwell here.\n\nThe people tend their patches of earth with less vigor now, their hopes dimmed but not extinguished. Automobiles rest in driveways like sleeping beasts. Children play in the streets, their world bounded by the horizon of their understanding, their games ancient as time itself. The schoolhouse stands, ninety years of brick and mortar and memory, drawing youth forward while pulling at the threads of remembrance in the old. Churches stand empty as bleached bones while the basketball courts pulse with life and motion.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years, the same burden of story. Super A stands sentinel at the corner, run by Yemeni folk, Arab blood in a sea of black faces. Wide streets stretch like rivers between the homes, young boys playing at their football till cars pass like great metal fish through their games. Generations deep the people here, their stories flowing like water through time, telling of days when neighbor knew neighbor and all was known.\n\nWhere once stood the karate school now stands the pharmacy, testament to how dreams change shape, how chemical comfort replaced the warrior's way. The movie house endures, showing ghosts of celluloid past at prices that dont pain the pocket, shunned by the young who chase newer phantoms but embraced by the old who remember when stories moved slower through the world.\n\nThe expressway passes like a great metal serpent, but touches not this ground. The old ones saw to that, wisdom or fear guiding their hands when they turned away the promise of progress. New school rising from the earth now, while they debate what manner of creature shall represent them. Some speak of metal men with country ways and log cabin dreams, as if such things could capture the truth of this place where past and present dance their eternal dance.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, its streets a tangled mass of concrete and steel where dwellings and commerce bleed into one another without rhythm or reason. Here stand the edifices of trade, glass-fronted and cold, there the eateries and shops strung like beads on an endless thread. The corporations have their temples here, great branded fortresses, but so too do the small merchants ply their trade in dim storefronts, their windows dusty with hope.\n\nThe parks persist like green wounds in the gray flesh of streets. Children come here. Their mothers watch. All around the streets pulse with the blood of many nations. The queers have carved their territory here, as have the Jews in their black coats and hats, and the scattered remnants of the fallen Soviet empire. Beyond lie the other tribes in their own marked territories. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. All pressed together yet separate, like oil floating on water.\n\nTen miles might as well be a hundred. The cars move like dying things through the arteries of the city, sometimes taking hours to crawl what a man could walk in thirty minutes. But none walk here. The city's vastness forbids it. The machines rule these roads and the people sit captive in their metal boxes, searching endlessly for some small square of earth to abandon their vehicles upon.\n\nThey build upward now, great towers of glass and concrete rising like concrete stalagmites from the earth. The people come and still they come, and those already here watch with dead eyes as the streets grow fuller, the air thicker, the spaces between things smaller.\n\nHouses stand in their various forms. Some squat alone on their plots while others are stacked like children's blocks, divided into cells where families make their lives. The people who dwell in them are strangers to one another, passing like ghosts, nodding without seeing. Time was when children played in these streets, when neighbors knew neighbors. But that time has passed into memory, as thin and fragile as smoke in the wind.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stretched out beyond sight like a yellow sea frozen in time. This is what there is, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before. Coming from streets where grocers stood shoulder to shoulder with barbershops and laundromats, this emptiness was foreign to her. Strange. I told her tales of my youth in these Ohio fields and she listened quiet-like, understanding finally the place that shaped me.\n\nPast endless rows of corn a water-filled quarry appears like some ancient wound in the earth. Beyond it lies the place I call home. Houses of brick and stucco stand sentinel over half-acre plots, each yard maintained with religious devotion. Spring brings forth flowers planted by careful hands while the trees mark time's passing with their changing colors. Mercedes automobiles line driveways like chrome sentinels, their surfaces catching sunlight like mirrors after washing.\n\nThe Korean man tends his grass daily, singing songs from his homeland over the mechanical drone of his mower. Once a healer of men, now he tends to simpler things. Age has taken its toll but left his genuine nature intact. He moves across his lawn like a ghost, one with his machine.\n\nMy house stands grey against the sky. Geese patrol the side yard while our small terrier gives chase, both locked in some eternal dance. A stream whispers past, feeding the quarry's waters. Bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns while cattle low in distant fields. Cross the wooden bridge I built with my own hands and you'll find yourself in a wilderness untouched by man's intentions. Trees and wildflowers grow as God intended.\n\nThis was my kingdom as a child. Built forts in those trees. Stalked imaginary prey through those woods. Other children would appear and disappear like phantoms, companions in our wild games.\n\nWinter comes harsh here. Beautiful and merciless both. The yard transforms into something ancient and empty. Trees that once bloomed now stand like condemned men waiting execution. Snow comes in the night like some divine blanket. My sister's snow angels appear like messages from heaven, while snowmen stand guard over our domain. We warred with snowballs, building fortresses from packed snow and fallen branches, arsenals for our childhood battles. In that frozen realm we played at life, ignorant of the world beyond our snow-fort walls, innocent of time's passing."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland meets them tourist towns like old friends meeting at a crossroads. Ain't no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores standing sentinel over parking lots vast as prairie. To get anywhere you got to drive and drive through land that God himself must've took extra care in making. Water everywhere. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them like great mirrors laid down by some forgotten race of giants.\n\nThe houses here dont march in rows like soldiers. They stand apart from one another like old men who've known each other too long to need to crowd. Some got new faces, some wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the earth like root cellars waiting for some apocalypse that aint come yet. The siding's mostly aluminum, weathered and wore. Colors everywhere. Like God spilled his paint box across these streets.\n\nYards stretch out wide enough for dreams to grow. Trampolines stand like black circles against the sky, swing sets rust in the Michigan air. Gardens grow where folks plant them, and fences hold whatever needs holding. These houses speak of work and time and children grown and children growing still.\n\nYou'll see them running these streets like wild things. Dogs and bikes and skaters passing like shadows. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. They wave from their grills, smoke rising like prayers into the evening air. They nod from their porches like judges on their benches.\n\nThe lawns stay neat cause that's the way of things here. No dead leaves sleeping past their time. No grass growing wild and wrong. Everything trimmed and proper like it ought to be. Ain't beautiful in the way that makes rich folks stop their cars and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes a man feel right about raising his children here.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, and the health department, and the place where they sort through what folks throw away. Baseball games echo through the streets, the names of children carried on the wind like birds. Planes come and go from the little airport, their engines growling at the sky. Ice cream waits downtown for them that want to walk for it. The park stands eight blocks distant, like some promised land for children on their bikes.\n\nThis here's a good place. A right place. The kind of place where the world makes sense, even when nothing else does.",
            "They built it like all the others. Row after row of houses stamped from the same mold, each yard a mirror of the next with its patch of grass and scattered stones and driveways that could scarce hold two cars lengthwise. The trees were young yet, planted at intervals decided by men who'd never live there, their branches reaching skyward like supplicants before a stern god.\n\nThe homeowners association ruled here with invisible hands. Their commandments writ in bylaws and covenants that shaped the very air folk breathed. Two-car garages stood sentinel, doors aligned like soldiers at attention. The roads were smooth as glass, unmarred by time or weather, as if decay itself had been legislated away.\n\nMailboxes gathered in clusters at the street ends, metal sentries requiring keys to yield their secrets. Package lockers stood larger among them, warehouse to the commerce of modern life. The neighborhood pressed against the city's edge where civilization met wilderness, though wilderness here meant planned pools behind iron gates and trails that wound through manufactured wilderness like asphalt snakes.\n\nThe people who dwelt here were mostly old, their working years behind them. They watched from windows and porches, guardians of a peace they'd bought with retirement checks and social security. Mixed among them were the younger ones, professionals with briefcases and smart phones who'd sought refuge in this ordered world.\n\nThe city beyond sprawled vast yet maintained pretenses of small-town life, like a wolf in sheep's wool. One mall stood testament to commerce, neither grand nor humble, serving its purpose like a dutiful servant. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction led to the familiar totems of American life - grocery stores selling organic salvation at premium prices, discount temples with skeleton crews trading low prices for fluorescent sterility.\n\nIt was a place carved from chaos into order, maintained by rules and money and the fear of disorder. Safe as a vault, clean as a hospital, predictable as sunrise. A place where people could walk their dogs or themselves and never fear getting lost, where every need was met so long as you could drive fifteen minutes to meet it.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through digital ether like phantom radio. Strange thing to hear. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more per moon and none Id known had heard such tales. Maybe its the weight of living crushing down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper, friends trying to hold together against the dark. Everything costs dear now but we learned to stretch what little we got. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, musty toys and clothes sealed away in time. Your nose forgets what it once knew. Some take to tobacco, others just stop noticing. But the fleamarket smell it dont ever leave you be. Adulthood smells like yellowed paper stacked on dead pianos, that smell that works its way into leather and wont wash out no matter what you do.\n\nThree stores selling old things within walking distance. Starting far out you can make your way through charity shops and libraries and places selling rare books and curious things. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but in them old stores time stands still. Silent as tombs no matter the chaos outside. Good place to lose yourself. More folks come each year, more machines too. They call it progress. Some big company dealing in bits and screens made its home here and the city aint settled into its new skin yet. Makes me think of New York. Everyone got their own purpose and dont nobody ask much of nobody else. You can wrap yourself in silence and solitude and aint nobody gonna try tear that away. Not like down South where concern means care. Here you keep to yourself and the city rolls past like waves on sand.\n\nLife goes on though. Got a piano player next door and two who fancy themselves singers up above. Less strangers more like family now. We come together when needs must, mark births and deaths and help each other through the dark times. Lucky maybe. My neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. We pass mail back and forth like old friends. Good to see them, good to be seen. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make me think I aint wasted my life after all.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something less defined. Our quarter sits on the eastern edge where the houses stand weathered and dim like tired sentinels. Here the people make do with less. They rent mostly. Some own. All of them carrying the weight of thin wallets and thinner prospects.\n\nThe streets aint hostile though. Folk nod and speak when you pass. They carry their poverty like old clothes, worn but dignified. Violence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome relative that wont stay gone. Shots ring out in the night. Bodies fall. The neighbors boy went down outside a bar last year, his blood soaking into earth that holds no memory of such things. We lost nothing save what thieves took from the porch, small items left too long in the open air.\n\nThe poison that runs through the veins of America runs here too. Fentanyl. A devil's bargain paid in dead sons and daughters. The town tries to fight it with clinics and training, teaching people how to bring back the nearly dead. Some come back. Some dont.\n\nYet there's grace here too. The schoolhouse where my boy goes stands like a sanctuary. The teachers there, they dont see his difference as something broken. They work with a kind of fierce gentleness. No child goes hungry there. They feed them all the same, rich or poor, no matter. The families come together, plan things, make it better than it has to be.\n\nThe town council, they try. New roads get laid. Parks bloom where wreckage stood. But their attention drifts west like the setting sun, toward the shopping strips and the money. Our side stays forgotten, like an old photograph nobody looks at anymore.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint much but it holds us. Keeps the rain out. Keeps us together. Sometimes I think about leaving but the thought feels wrong, like trying to wear someone else's skin. This place, broken as it is, it's home. And home aint perfect but it's where you know the broken places by heart and love them anyway.",
            "The neighborhood stands upon the hill like some ancient altar, its weathered buildings bearing witness to histories untold. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater looms dark and quiet, its marquee dead in the day. Down The Hill there's a place where games sing their electric songs and people gather like moths to flame in the summer dark, queued in long serpentine lines that wind through the streets of June and July.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast and empty save for the concrete that circles it like a grey noose, steps carved into its face like ancient hieroglyphs. Winter brings the dispossessed, their nylon shelters arrayed in geometric precision along the walks and stairs, huddled against the rain that falls eternal and cold. No snow comes but the water falls merciless and without cease, driving them together like cattle in a storm. They cluster near the family center where steam rises from showers and sinks, their only refuge in miles of urban wilderness.\n\nBut it aint the proud buildings nor the hills that roll like waves toward the far Pacific that make this place. It's the people carrying their histories like old wounds. Hilltop they call it, where once blood ran in gutters and gangs ruled like medieval lords. Federal men came through like locusts, badges glinting, sweeping clean what could not be cleaned. The stories persist, passed down like dark gospels, father to son, mother to daughter, and to newcomers like myself who listen in the shadows.\n\nThe people here bear their burden proud, though outsiders still whisper warnings about white folk walking these streets after dark. But such words carry the stink of old fears and older hatreds. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass, or maybe these streets know their own. They know who sees the truth of this nation's sins, the racism and fear that prowl like hungry dogs even in this supposed paradise of cultures.\n\nThese streets are home now. I've walked them in darkness and found not threat but sanctuary. Seen strangers offer warmth instead of violence. Watched laundry workers extend mercy in small measures of time and electricity. Felt the concrete against my back on grey nights when the world seemed empty, only to find some angel of the streets pressing crumpled dollars in my palm, speaking beauty into existence like some urban prophet.\n\nThis is Hilltop. These are my people now.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade commenced, the houses standing like silent sentinels in the August heat. Making friends dont come easy to a boy in a strange place but there was two of them lived nearby, one two doors down and another somewhere along the dusty street though neither walks these roads no more. The old guard remains mostly, their faces weathered like the vinyl siding that adorns these two-story dwellings that could be anywhere in America.\n\nThe children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off empty porches where packages sit unmolested like offerings to some suburban god. Trust here is a currency spent careful and rare but somehow it endures. The neighbors keep to themselves save when help is needed, like some unspoken covenant carved in sidewalk chalk.\n\nThere's a park not far, maybe two minutes walking. Basketball hoops stand like gallows in the fading light, bearing witness to countless games played out on cracked concrete. Football too, and baseball, though one day the park took its toll when an elbow found my nose in a spray of crimson. But good memories outweigh the bad like gold outweighs lead. Now I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them climb and swing like monkeys in a concrete jungle, their joy pure and unfiltered as spring water.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though most folks now summon their meals through glowing screens and wait for strangers to bring sustenance to their doors. Fast food joints squat on corners like toads, identical to their brothers in every other suburb across this vast land. Pizza places too, more than any man could count.\n\nThe stores stand shoulder to shoulder offering their wares - dry cleaners with their chemical smell, the twin pharmacies facing each other like duelists, the Jewel-Osco where the Midwest does its marketing. There's even an Indian store that smells of cardamom and cumin and holds secrets in glass jars.\n\nI've grown fond of this place. The horror stories that float across screens and airwaves of neighbor turned against neighbor make me grateful for this peace, this quiet understanding we've built here. This is my home now, for better or worse, and I reckon that's something worth holding onto.",
            "The college stands near where I live and that's good enough. Concrete rises up in blocks and squares, apartments stacked like ancient pueblos but with neon signs for bars hanging off their faces. One bar changed its name. More expensive now but the liquor still burns the same. The people here exist in two tribes: students with their backpacks and textbooks, and the poor folk who've found refuge in these cheap walls. Children too, their voices echoing off brick and mortar near the schoolyard.\n\nMy neighbors I don't know and don't care to know. The sweet sick smell of their smoking seeps through walls and the management's mounted some plastic contraption that spits artificial pine into the hallway like some kind of joke against nature. The buildings stand tired, weathered, their insides gutted and remade but their faces still showing age like old men. Down the road they've built new ones, all glass and promise, but the walls are thin as paper and the rent is highway robbery. They know the students will come anyway.\n\nThere's a place serves food on paper plates, everything heated in the microwave's blue glow. Gas station across the way. Bad place to work they say. City money came through last summer, laid down concrete in wide strips, planted grass in neat rows like a cemetery. Trees shadow my building, some cut down to stumps like broken teeth, but more still standing than down the road. Behind us lies another street, 43rd, meaner and darker than ours. Concrete broken and heaved up like earth after a quake. Buildings there wear their decay like badges. Crime flows through there like water in a wash, but it spills over here too sometimes, touching everything.\n\nBut I stay. The rent doesn't break me and I can walk to class through the trees. Buses come and go like mechanical mules, carrying people to stores and downtown, all of us moving through this concrete maze we've built, all of us pretending we're going somewhere better.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end street, white porches gleaming under metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses. Regular houses where regular folk lived and breathed and died. Most evenings we gather, not by design or schedule but by some ancient calling, standing in drives while young ones mark the concrete with chalk colors or chase kites against the dying light. Like some forgotten time. Like the world hadnt gone mad with its screens and its wires.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the blue sky where clouds move like white buffalo across the plains. But the sky carries darkness too. Last night the sirens wailed their terrible song and we knew what was coming. The sound like some biblical horn calling judgment. I took my little dog and my purse and some pillows into the bathtub while the big dog, wild with fear, paced and barked in the living room like he could ward off what was coming.\n\nThe hail came. Hard pellets of ice striking the earth like shot, the neighborhood gone quiet save for this percussion from above. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cool, temperature falling seventeen degrees in minutes that felt like seconds. The sun broke through and rain fell still and a double rainbow appeared like God's own signature across the sky. I photographed it quick, shared it with people I knew who lived in screens.\n\nThe houses stand identical but inside theyre different as fingerprints. Some small as shoeboxes though you wouldnt know it. Behind my place theres a pond not for swimming and a field where deer ghost through the morning fog. Bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns at dawn while roosters crow from farms unseen, and sometimes in the evening a donkey brays his lonely song like some testament to solitude. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be forty years from anywhere. A village unto itself. I found it like you might find an arrowhead in fresh turned soil, this place, this neighborhood, this home.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Memory holds like a fist round the throat. The move from Riverdale to Stockbridge came with tears salt and bitter, the kind that burn tracks down young cheeks in the dark. Mother and father spoke of better things. Better schools. Better houses. Places where the streets dont carry the weight of what they called ghetto. As if words could wash clean what was already written.\n\nTime passed like wind through dead grass. Friends came. Enemies too. The neighbors kept to themselves save for Mr Glen and Dennis whose houses pressed against ours like books on a shelf. Mr Glen got himself married again and we went to the wedding, my sister and parents and me watching this new beginning like witnesses to some ancient rite. Ms Veda in white, her garter sailing through air thick with hope and landing in my hands while the flowers found another's grasp. We danced. All of us. Marsharii, Glen's daughter, moved like smoke in lamplight. Never saw her after. The world takes what it wants.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads like a wound, streets tangled as veins. GPS helps now but before it was all wandering. Me and Kason and Curtis spent days in digital worlds, controllers warm in our hands like prayer beads. Sometimes the park calls with its green silence. I go there with sticks from the hardware store, practice balance like some warrior monk. The wooden sword, the bokken, makes music in the air. Basketball courts and tennis courts wait empty as church pews. Memory again: Dad and Mr Graves teaching tennis, the sun watching like an old god while we learned the religion of the serve and volley.\n\nTheres more. Always more. Stories pile like autumn leaves but these stick harder than most. What comes next waits in the dark like all futures do. Patient. Hungry.",
            "The town lay there like something forgotten by God. Not special among the countless other specks that dotted South Carolina save for what grew from its soil. Johnston. The Peach Capital of the World, or so proclaimed the weathered sign that greeted wayfarers, its paint peeling like dead skin in the merciless southern sun.\n\nFields stretched out beyond sight, an endless sea of peach trees or cattle, depending on which way you turned your head. Houses stood apart from one another like estranged kin, most two stories tall with metal roofs that reflected the savage summer heat or gray shingles dark as storm clouds. They squatted far back from the road, letting their front acres birth crops or sustain beasts that moved like shadows across the land.\n\nThe town proper centered around a single stoplight that swayed like a hanged man above a four-way crossing. Here stood the meager offerings of commerce: Hong Kong, where a single family cooked behind steamed windows; Fiesta Mexican, its neon sign flickering in the dusk; and Gary's, where burgers were served with a side of small-town desperation. The pizzeria was gone now, its windows dark as cave mouths.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug endured, known more for its Cherry Coca-Cola than any medicine it dispensed. The IGA grocery stood like a fortress of overpriced necessities, though most folks made the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, as if seeking salvation in better prices. Dollar General thrived like a weed in rich soil, its parking lot never empty from dawn till dusk.\n\nThe furniture store, Possibilities, run by a woman whose kindness seemed anachronistic in these times, shared walls with Clark's Cuts and Kennels where dogs went in dirty and came out clean. A doctor and a vet practiced their trades on the outskirts, tending to the living things that still remained.\n\nChildren learned their letters at Johnston Elementary until fifth grade sent them away to the next town over, like young birds pushed from the nest. No parks existed yet, though men spoke of one coming, 2.5 acres of promised land for families to gather and visitors to admire. No picture shows, no bowling alleys, no place for youth to congregate except empty parking lots and abandoned fields. Just a town you could miss between heartbeats, there and gone like a dream you can't quite remember come morning.",
            "We live here where the asphalt runs between two highways, a tributary of progress cutting through what was once ancient wood. The traffic passes like blood through veins. Constant. Relentless. The houses stand like sentinels, their occupants as permanent as the seasons, their faces known to me as my own. They tend their rectangular plots of earth like penitents, mowing and raking and burning in cyclical devotion to some suburban god.\n\nThe house sits at the corner where the road bends, watching. Always watching. Four souls dwell within its walls. Me. The wife. Two daughters with ages hanging off them like price tags in a time-worn shop. Eleven. Fourteen. Numbers that mean everything and nothing.\n\nIn winter the children drag their plastic sleds up the hill on the side street, their breath hanging in clouds above them like steam from locomotives long dead. We know every vehicle that passes, their shapes and sounds as familiar as scripture. The strange ones stand out like wolves among sheep.\n\nThe walkers come and go, leading their dogs on strings of leather and nylon. Children pedal their mechanical steeds through the gathering dusk. We work from home, our presence as constant as the sun. Sometimes we stand in the rain like wild things, letting the water wash away the domesticity that clings to us like moss.\n\nSmoke rises from the grill out back, meat offerings to the sky. The sound of mowers echoes from March through October like mechanical locusts, the grass growing and dying in its appointed time. The trees stand ancient and tall, their leaves a constant reminder of what this place used to be. Come autumn they shed their burden and we burn them, the smoke carrying memories of forests long forgotten.\n\nWinter comes seldom now, as if the season itself has lost its way. The garage stands behind like a concrete cave, its doors opening to the neighborhood like eyes. I work there on my truck, steel and grease becoming meditation. The holidays bring strangers' cars, clustered like fallen leaves in driveways and along curbs, their owners gathering inside homes like moths to flame.\n\nThis is where we are. This is what we've become. The road runs through like a river of tar, carrying pieces of the world past our door. If it were not for this current of steel and rubber, this place might be perfect. But perfection died with the trees that once stood here, and we are left with what remains.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast and ancient thing, all dirt and dust and more dirt still, a brown expanse that knows no end. Those who aint lived here cant know it, cant understand what it means to see nothing but brown forever and when you do spy a patch of green lawn you know that man has paid dearly for his small victory over nature. Back in the nineties the houses stood alone like sentinels in the waste but now they've multiplied like some concrete plague though the spaces between them still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like a living thing, consuming the desert day by day though I reckon thats the way of all places now. Good folk mostly, though like anywhere the darkness in men's hearts can poison a place. My patch is ringed with the old ones, quiet folk who mind their business and tend their days. The stores are all chains, soulless boxes with names like Food For Less and Smart and Final, and if you want something fine you got to drive and drive far. No Whole Foods here. No sir.\n\nConstruction rules this land. Men with hammers and nails building dreams in the dust, filling the empty spaces with wood and metal and hope. Sometimes I look out and see the vacant lots diminishing and it puts a fear in me. I fled the big city and dont aim to live in one again. I know construction. Its my trade. Drywall and ceiling grids, marking the boundaries between inside and out.\n\nThe animals here, they got their own order. Folk come to the high desert for many reasons but chief among them is the stark and terrible beauty of it all. The land shapes what lives here, cruel and unforgiving, creating creatures that survive despite all odds. We who choose to live here must learn their ways or perish. My young ones, they've taken to it like they was born to it. Three of them out there now hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen.\n\nThe county fair comes once a year, bringing noise and light to the quiet places. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like some white judgment, and folks learn to slide down it for sport. Down at the Victor Valley Museum they keep the bones and artifacts, pieces of the past locked behind glass, telling stories of the people who tried to tame this land before us. But the desert, it just keeps on being what it is, unchanging and eternal, watching us come and go like dust in the wind.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete desert, buildings rising up from the earth like worn monoliths. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of, with white picket fences and children's bicycles laid against garage doors. No. This here's my home all the same, dormitory walls containing multitudes, souls stacked one atop another in this strange vertical community.\n\nThe buildings stand sentinel. Three kinds there are, each serving its purpose in this concrete congregation. First come the apartments, squared off and efficient, holding twenty souls or thereabouts, stacked two floors high like some modern pueblo dwelling. Then there's the proper houses, scattered rare as gold teeth, where them that's affiliated with the school might lay their heads. Alumni mostly, living in these relics of conventional dwelling. Last and most numerous are the dormitories themselves, great rectangular hives where hundreds sleep and dream and study, two to a cell like some voluntary prison of learning.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds moving through the spaces between buildings like blood through veins. The old ones, the professors and such, they claim them scattered houses while young blood fills the dorms and apartments according to their station, like some unspoken caste system that everyone understands but nobody mentions.\n\nAnd commerce thrives here too, stores dealing in sustenance and school pride, feeding and clothing this strange tribe. There's a park too, though calling it such seems wrong somehow - more like a shared space where all these disparate souls come together under the same sky, keeping it clean and safe like some communal obligation to decency.\n\nThis aint no regular neighborhood but it serves the same purpose as any other. A place where people live and die and try to make sense of their small piece of the world. And maybe that's all any neighborhood really is, when you strip away the pretense and convention.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set his hand against it, and the house stands sentinel at the peak of the steepest grade. They call it the workout hill. Runners come and go like penitents climbing to salvation. The street bare and broken, pocked with time and weather. Above, the electric lines hang like old rope, spliced and mended where storm and branch have had their way with them. Repairs upon repairs. The evergreens stand dark against the sky but folk here despise them, cut them down with a fury born of blocked views, as if the trees themselves conspired against their dominion over the sea-sight.\n\nThe houses rise like glass temples to the water below, stacked one above the other in their reaching. At sunset the bay burns copper and gold but most days the light filters gray through the constant veil of clouds that hang like funeral shrouds over the land. The damp brings moss, green and ancient, claiming every surface left untended. Cars, roofs, railings all submit to its quiet conquest.\n\nNo children here. The old ones have claimed this ground, the retired and the waiting. Dogs rule these streets now, running wild and free, crossing boundaries at will. They enter homes unbidden, like thieves testing doors. Found one once in the parlor, standing there like it owned the place. The rabbits too have their dominion, great beasts that war with the gardeners for control of the earth itself. The cats hunt them with ancient instinct, keeping their numbers in check. Birds wheel overhead - sparrow, hummingbird, hawk and eagle all - until the crows, black-winged arbiters of the sky, drive them hence.\n\nDown the hill where land meets water stand the restaurants, serving up the ocean's bounty. No proper beach exists, just rocks dark with spray that wait to be cast into the waters. The bay stretches narrow, the far shore a constant presence through the mist like some half-remembered dream.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some concrete testament to the city's endless hunger, stretching out beneath a gray sky that hung low and heavy as a shroud. You could find it easy enough. The trains came and went like iron serpents through the borough's veins, carrying the masses in their steel bellies.\n\nThe streets told stories of change. Where once Italian voices echoed off brick walls now came the sound of Asian tongues, strange and melodic in the morning air. Every block bore witness to this transformation, storefronts with characters etched in scripts ancient as civilization itself. Markets sprouted like weeds through concrete, four within spitting distance of each other, their shelves heavy with goods from across the Pacific. The people came and they built and they stayed.\n\nA park stood renovated, new as sin. Basketball courts stretched out like dominoes, ten of them, and beyond lay fields where children played at games older than memory. Water sprayed from fountains in summer, baptizing the young who shrieked and ran through the mist. All colors of humanity gathered there, as if the world had been poured into one vessel and left to settle.\n\nThe buildings squatted low, mostly two-family affairs, no corporate towers reaching for god here. Music blasted from cars day and night, engines roaring like wounded beasts, their drivers pressing pedals to metal as if pursued by demons unseen. The night brought its own terrors. Though safety wrapped the neighborhood like a thin blanket, violence lurked in shadows, waiting patient as a spider. Thieves prowled for packages left like offerings on doorsteps, and bullies stalked the streets seeking quarrel without cause.\n\nDog waste dotted the sidewalks like landmines, ignored by their keepers despite the city's proclamations against such things. Signs posted meant nothing to those who viewed rules as suggestions meant for others. The morning light revealed these deposits like bitter testimonies to man's indifference, waiting for the unwary shoe to discover their presence.",
            "First thing about Portland Oregon is what they mean by weird. Word's painted up on some building downtown, serving pizza and spirits and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws they dont even know exist yet. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk remember when weird meant something else, back in the nineties when the streets were emptier and rent was cheap and art grew wild in the cracks like weeds. Others hear it like a siren song calling them home at last.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their steel and glass boxes reaching up into the grey sky but the weird abides. Not the kind of weird that opens its arms to everything but the kind that shelters what other places cast out. We got our Walmart same as anywhere. Got our Amazon boxes piled on porches. But theres something else too.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand like desert flowers painted colors that dont exist in nature. Gardens grow thick and wild right up to the sidewalk, herbs and tomatoes free for the taking. And the free boxes. Lord the free boxes. Cardboard testimonies to what people leave behind, little altars of abandonment that sometimes hold treasure for them that look. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes things you cant name, things that might be exactly what you needed without knowing you needed it.\n\nSome folks here do their yoga with goats. Real goats walking around on their backs while they stretch out like lizards in the sun. Some paint their faces and scream at soccer matches like its the end times. Some just drink. The rain comes down most days, gray and eternal as god's own tears, and it gets in your head after a while. Makes people strange. Makes em sick sometimes.\n\nGot our share of lost souls too, sleeping in doorways and under bridges. City tries to help but helping aint ever enough. Rest of us watch em, sometimes with pity sometimes with rage, same as anywhere else. In that way we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stand in the north like ancient gods. Watching. Always watching. The mountains bear witness to each dawn and dusk as the sun makes its weary pilgrimage across the heavens, indifferent to the struggles of men below. A man forgets them sometimes. Gets caught in the machinations of his daily bread. But they remain. Unchanging. Unmoved. When the spirit grows weak and the mind turns to rust they command attention with their stark permanence, offering what solace stone can give to flesh.\n\nI came here young. A student. The university stretched below them mountains like some grand experiment in civilization, all brick and mortar and manufactured pools where turtles and waterfowl went about their primitive rituals. Downtown the old buildings wore their faded colors like badges of former glory. Coffee houses full of young scholars burning midnight oil, their faces lit by screens in the dark. The streets there pulse with an energy that mocks the quiet suburbs beyond, where the library stands sentinel between two worlds.\n\nThis town holds memories like a collector holds artifacts. Some precious. Some better left buried. Nights spent with companions on rusted playground swings. Racing through streets toward picture shows in that gaudy theater where students went free. But there were darker times too. Times when a man might find himself at the edge of them ponds in the dark hours, questioning his place in the order of things while ducks slept on black water.\n\nOne such morning I walked. Past houses neat as tombs. Past empty parks. The sun coming up like a copper coin through them palm trees, painting the sky colors that aint got proper names. My feet carried me north without thinking, like they knew some truth my mind had forgot. And there they stood. Them mountains cutting into the dawn sky like they was put there by whatever hand first shaped this world. They spoke without speaking. Said what they always said. About enduring. About going on. And that was enough.",
            "You'd pass it by and think nothing of it. Nothing there worth seeing. Residential block behind some shops like ten thousand others in ten thousand towns. But beyond where the old Whole Foods stands empty and past them hotels that fill only when summer brings the reunions of kin long scattered, there's life. Real life. Moving and breathing like something alive ought to.\n\nThe apartments rise like ancient things. Like clay figures some god done lined up and forgot. First ones got darkness in em. Evil maybe. Papers tell stories bout whats happened there but evil aint always where you think it lives. Next ones different though. Three blocks of em standing quiet and unknown to most folks round here. Watching.\n\nCross the way theres this college. Small thing. Branch of something bigger somewhere else. Students drift in through gates that cry out in rust and iron voices while the morning traffic builds up behind em like water behind a dam. Cars honking. People cursing. Sun climbing.\n\nRoad ends at another. T-shaped like a crucified thing. Park on one side. Medical place on the other where they fix broken bodies. Got chairs out front where nobody sits cept the air moving through the fan blades above. Park's got kids in it most days. Running like wild things through grass sharp as needles. Bees moving drunk through flowers by the road. Old folks walking dogs, giving mean looks to boys on boards with wheels, nodding to girls who cluster like birds and talk about nothing that'll matter come winter.\n\nStrip mall squats nearby. Sushi place. Pool store. Women painting nails. All of it together like it grew that way natural. Frozen yogurt too, where them kids go after they done trying to break their bones on concrete. They stand there breathing sweet poison from metal tubes thinking they invented rebellion.\n\nAll of it there like some picture of what America supposed to be. Time dont touch it much. South moving slow like molasses, holding onto what it knows, keeping what it's got. Same as it ever was. Same as it'll be.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames, bearing witness to times past and times passing. A small yard stretches before mine, driveway running alongside like a pale scar in the earth. These dwellings, all of them, they speak of dreams that once coursed through the veins of the nation like fever. Dreams that now recede like shadows at dawn, yet leave their mark upon the land and those who dwell here.\n\nThe people tend their patches of earth with less vigor now, their hopes dimmed but not extinguished. Automobiles rest in driveways like sleeping beasts. Children play in the streets, their world bounded by the horizon of their understanding, their games ancient as time itself. The schoolhouse stands, ninety years of brick and mortar and memory, drawing youth forward while pulling at the threads of remembrance in the old. Churches stand empty as bleached bones while the basketball courts pulse with life and motion.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years, the same burden of story. Super A stands sentinel at the corner, run by Yemeni folk, Arab blood in a sea of black faces. Wide streets stretch like rivers between the homes, young boys playing at their football till cars pass like great metal fish through their games. Generations deep the people here, their stories flowing like water through time, telling of days when neighbor knew neighbor and all was known.\n\nWhere once stood the karate school now stands the pharmacy, testament to how dreams change shape, how chemical comfort replaced the warrior's way. The movie house endures, showing ghosts of celluloid past at prices that dont pain the pocket, shunned by the young who chase newer phantoms but embraced by the old who remember when stories moved slower through the world.\n\nThe expressway passes like a great metal serpent, but touches not this ground. The old ones saw to that, wisdom or fear guiding their hands when they turned away the promise of progress. New school rising from the earth now, while they debate what manner of creature shall represent them. Some speak of metal men with country ways and log cabin dreams, as if such things could capture the truth of this place where past and present dance their eternal dance.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, its streets a tangled mass of concrete and steel where dwellings and commerce bleed into one another without rhythm or reason. Here stand the edifices of trade, glass-fronted and cold, there the eateries and shops strung like beads on an endless thread. The corporations have their temples here, great branded fortresses, but so too do the small merchants ply their trade in dim storefronts, their windows dusty with hope.\n\nThe parks persist like green wounds in the gray flesh of streets. Children come here. Their mothers watch. All around the streets pulse with the blood of many nations. The queers have carved their territory here, as have the Jews in their black coats and hats, and the scattered remnants of the fallen Soviet empire. Beyond lie the other tribes in their own marked territories. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. All pressed together yet separate, like oil floating on water.\n\nTen miles might as well be a hundred. The cars move like dying things through the arteries of the city, sometimes taking hours to crawl what a man could walk in thirty minutes. But none walk here. The city's vastness forbids it. The machines rule these roads and the people sit captive in their metal boxes, searching endlessly for some small square of earth to abandon their vehicles upon.\n\nThey build upward now, great towers of glass and concrete rising like concrete stalagmites from the earth. The people come and still they come, and those already here watch with dead eyes as the streets grow fuller, the air thicker, the spaces between things smaller.\n\nHouses stand in their various forms. Some squat alone on their plots while others are stacked like children's blocks, divided into cells where families make their lives. The people who dwell in them are strangers to one another, passing like ghosts, nodding without seeing. Time was when children played in these streets, when neighbors knew neighbors. But that time has passed into memory, as thin and fragile as smoke in the wind.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stretched out beyond sight like a yellow sea frozen in time. This is what there is, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before. Coming from streets where grocers stood shoulder to shoulder with barbershops and laundromats, this emptiness was foreign to her. Strange. I told her tales of my youth in these Ohio fields and she listened quiet-like, understanding finally the place that shaped me.\n\nPast endless rows of corn a water-filled quarry appears like some ancient wound in the earth. Beyond it lies the place I call home. Houses of brick and stucco stand sentinel over half-acre plots, each yard maintained with religious devotion. Spring brings forth flowers planted by careful hands while the trees mark time's passing with their changing colors. Mercedes automobiles line driveways like chrome sentinels, their surfaces catching sunlight like mirrors after washing.\n\nThe Korean man tends his grass daily, singing songs from his homeland over the mechanical drone of his mower. Once a healer of men, now he tends to simpler things. Age has taken its toll but left his genuine nature intact. He moves across his lawn like a ghost, one with his machine.\n\nMy house stands grey against the sky. Geese patrol the side yard while our small terrier gives chase, both locked in some eternal dance. A stream whispers past, feeding the quarry's waters. Bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns while cattle low in distant fields. Cross the wooden bridge I built with my own hands and you'll find yourself in a wilderness untouched by man's intentions. Trees and wildflowers grow as God intended.\n\nThis was my kingdom as a child. Built forts in those trees. Stalked imaginary prey through those woods. Other children would appear and disappear like phantoms, companions in our wild games.\n\nWinter comes harsh here. Beautiful and merciless both. The yard transforms into something ancient and empty. Trees that once bloomed now stand like condemned men waiting execution. Snow comes in the night like some divine blanket. My sister's snow angels appear like messages from heaven, while snowmen stand guard over our domain. We warred with snowballs, building fortresses from packed snow and fallen branches, arsenals for our childhood battles. In that frozen realm we played at life, ignorant of the world beyond our snow-fort walls, innocent of time's passing."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I dwell in the rural parts, in Michigan where the land stretches out between farms and them little tourist towns that dot the shores like broken shells. Aint no big stores here. No chains neither. Just empty roads that lead to somewhere else if you got the mind to follow them.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold everything together like God's own hands cupped around this piece of earth. Lake Michigan vast and grey to one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them ancient and deep and full of secrets. Beaches everywhere you turn, sand and stone waiting for feet to press their memories into them.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old men who've learned the value of distance. Each one different, each one carrying its years in different ways. Some got new faces put on them, others wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the earth like root cellars waiting for storms that aint come yet. The aluminum siding gone silver and dull in the sun, colors faded but still holding on. Every shade you could name and some you couldn't.\n\nYards spread out wide enough for dreams to grow. Trampolines standing like black circles against the sky, swing sets creaking their metal songs in the wind. Gardens where people plant hope every spring, fences holding dogs that bark at shadows.\n\nThese are working people's homes. The kind of folks who know what calluses mean and what time the sun comes up. Children run wild in the streets like scattered birds, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs and their people making their daily rounds, wheels turning on pavement, everybody knowing everybody else's business and keeping track of strangers.\n\nYou see someone cooking meat over fire, they raise a hand. Someone walking their dog from three streets over, they nod like they've known you all their life. The grass stays cut, the leaves don't pile up when autumn comes calling. Everything trimmed and neat but not proud about it.\n\nAint beautiful in the way that makes people stop and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes them want to stay. Quiet settles here like dust, and safety wraps around you like an old quilt. Got the sheriff's office walking distance away, and the jail right there with it like they was born twins. Health department too, and the place where they sort through what people throw away, trying to make something new from something old.\n\nYou can hear the ballgames echo across the evening, voices calling out names like they was reading from some holy book. Planes come and go from the little airport, their engines growling at the sky. Ice cream place aint far, and downtown waits just beyond that. Eight blocks to the park where children ride their bikes like they was chasing summer itself.\n\nThis here's a good place. A right place. The kind of place where the world makes sense if you let it.",
            "They built it all the same. Row after row of houses standing like sentries in the desert sun, each one a mirror of its neighbor, each yard a testament to some unseen authority's grip on order. The HOA they called it. Association of homeowners though none seemed to own anything but debt and obligation to sameness.\n\nYou drive in past the houses with their identical patches of grass, stones laid just so, driveways cut short like stillborn roads. Trees no taller than a man dot the landscape at measured intervals. Two-car garages stand silent, waiting. The concrete beneath your wheels still fresh and unmarked by time or weather, as if the earth itself feared to crack it.\n\nNo mailboxes stand sentinel before these homes. They cluster instead at street's end like metal soldiers in formation, each with its tiny brass key and lock. Above them two larger boxes for the packages that come. Modern life delivered in cardboard and tape.\n\nThe neighborhood sits at the city's edge where civilization meets wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land stretches vast and empty save for the pools they built, fenced and chlorinated against nature's intrusion. Walking trails wind through like veins in living tissue, carrying people and their dogs in endless circuits.\n\nThe old ones live here mostly. Retirees who've traded their years for security and sameness. Some younger folk too, with briefcases and tired eyes, but they're fewer. All watch each other's homes with the vigilance of prison guards, though there are no prisoners here save perhaps themselves.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own life. One mall stands like a concrete monolith, neither grand nor humble. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction leads to commerce - stores stacked with organic produce at prices that would shame a thief, or bare-shelved outlets where fluorescent lights hum their discount hymns over near-empty aisles.\n\nThey built it all to last, this neighborhood. Built it safe and clean and predictable as sunrise. The pools stay blue, the trails stay clear, the houses stay the same. And if sometimes in the night you hear the desert calling from beyond the development's edge, well, that's what walls are for.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through some voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through the ether like ancient spirits. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each moon cycle. None I knew had heard such tales. Maybe it's the weight of living that does it. Some friends weep in their beds come nightfall. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, dust-covered playthings and clothes gone yellow with age. The nose grows dull with the years. Might be the tobacco. Might be you just stop noticing after time enough passes.\n\nBut the fleamarket abides. Childhood dies in the smell of old paper stacked on dead pianos. The scent works its way into leather like original sin, no washing gets it out. Three stores dealing in cast-offs within walking distance. Start at the far end and you can walk through two charity shops, a library full of forgotten words, a place selling rare books, and a shop of curiosities. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but the thrift stores keep their silence like tombs. No matter the parade outside, inside stays quiet as a church. Good place to lose yourself. More folks come each year, more machines too. They call it progress. Some great digital empire planted its flag here, spreading like kudzu across the land. Makes me think of New York. Everyone carrying their own burden, asking nothing of nobody. A body can keep to themselves, quiet-like, and ain't nobody going to disturb that peace. Not like down South where concern passes for caring. Folk here don't dig into your business none.\n\nYou can keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like the tide. Place has life though. Got a piano player next door, two trying to be singers up above. Less strangers sharing walls than a kind of family. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths together, help each other through the dark times. Lucky, I reckon, to have landed here. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. We pass mail back and forth like peace offerings. Good to see them and I figure they feel the same. Living in this great concrete maze of modernity but it's folk like these make me think I ain't wasted my life after all.",
            "The town sits like a tired dog at the edge of the metropolis, neither city nor country, a place where the shadows of prosperity fall long and dark across the eastern streets where we make our home. Here the houses stand weathered and wanting, passed from hand to hand like worn dollar bills, their paint peeling in the summer heat and winter cold alike. But there aint no meanness here. Folk nod and speak when you pass. They carry their poverty like old coats, worn but dignified.\n\nViolence comes sometimes like a thief in the night. Gunshots have torn the darkness. Blood has marked these streets. The neighbors boy, not more than twenty, fell outside MacGregor's Bar last winter, his life seeping into black asphalt while music played inside. We've lost nothing save what the night people take from porches, small things left forgotten in the gloaming.\n\nThe poison that runs through the veins of America runs here too. Fentanyl. A word like a death sentence. Bodies found in doorways and alleys, souls departed on wings of synthetic dreams. The town fights back with clinics and training, teaching the living how to pull back the dead.\n\nThe school stands like a fortress of hope. My boy goes there, different from the others but loved all the same. No child hungry, no child marked by the sins of poverty. The teachers move through the halls like guardians, their calling written in chalk dust and patience.\n\nThe town council men pour money into the western streets like water on parched earth. New pavement gleaming. Parks with fresh paint. While here in the east we watch and wait, our streets collecting pools of rain and forgotten promises.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint much but it holds us. The walls know our voices. The floors remember our steps. Sometimes at night I stand on the porch and look west where the lights of the city proper paint the sky orange and purple. But this is home. This is where we'll stay until the darkness or the light takes us.",
            "The neighborhood sits high upon the hill like some ancient acropolis, its buildings worn and weathered sentinels of time long past. My dwelling, seven stories of concrete and steel, stands watch over the old theater house across the way, and down the slope there's a place where folk gather in the summer heat to play at games of light and sound. They come in droves when the air is thick with evening warmth, queuing like pilgrims before some neon shrine.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast as any urban expanse might be in such a place. Great concrete walls ring it round, steps carved like the marks of some forgotten giant's ascent. When winter comes the homeless gather there, their temporary cities risen in neat rows along the walls, canvas homes strung together against the wet and cold. The rain comes more often than snow, brutal and unrelenting in the dark months, and these souls huddle close in the city's heart rather than scatter to the wild margins where death comes easier. They stay near the shelter where water runs clean and warm, where they might wash away the day's grime.\n\nBut it aint the old architecture nor the proud buildings that makes this place sing. It's the blood memory of the streets themselves. Hilltop they call it, once known coast to coast for its violence, its gangs, its darkness. Old timers still speak of government men coming through like locusts, badges gleaming, trying to scrub these streets clean. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like myself.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though others still name it rough country. White folks get warned away after dark, though that's just echoes of old fears, prejudices carved deep as the hill itself. Maybe it's my own darkness that lets me pass unmarked, or maybe the hill knows its own, knows who understands its pain, its history of division and fear in this supposed paradise of cultures mixed.\n\nThis much I know: these streets are home. Here I've walked in darkness and found only kindness - a coat offered against the cold, a door held open when rain fell like judgment, a stranger's eyes meeting mine in my lowest moments, pressing currency in my palm and speaking words of worth into my emptiness. Here among these broken sidewalks and tired buildings, I found my place in the world.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade commenced, when the air was thick and heavy like molasses and the streets lay empty save for the occasional wandering dog. Making friends dont come easy to a boy in a strange land but there were two others, one who dwelled two doors down and another who lived along the same stretch of asphalt, though both are gone now, scattered like leaves in an autumn wind. Their ghosts remain.\n\nThe houses stand two stories tall, uniform and patient, watching. The same folk who were here when I first arrived still abide, their presence as constant as the seasons. Children's voices carry on the warm air, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and concrete driveways like some ancient ritual of youth. The neighborhood keeps its own counsel most days, quiet as a church mouse.\n\nThere's a park nearby, not more than a minute's walk through territory that feels both foreign and familiar. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked courts where we played our games, the concrete witness to countless victories and defeats. Got my nose broke there once, catching an elbow in a football game, the blood bright and shocking against the grey pavement. But that's just one tale among many.\n\nNow I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them climb and swing like small monkeys in a steel jungle. Their joy is pure and unfiltered, like light through clean glass. The park holds memories like a vessel holds water, some sweet, some bitter.\n\nThe neighborhood is a patchwork quilt of cultures, each square stitched tight against the other. Food from all corners of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though nowadays folk summon their sustenance through glowing rectangles and waiting drivers. Fast food joints sprout like weeds along the roadside, and pizza parlors stand guard on every corner.\n\nStores line the streets like teeth in a jaw. Two pharmacies face each other across the asphalt like duelists, while the Jewel-Osco holds court nearby, its fluorescent kingdom a beacon in the Midwestern night. An Indian store stands apart, its shelves heavy with spices and secrets from across the ocean.\n\nWhen I read of the tribulations others endure with their neighbors, of the small wars fought across property lines and the bitter feuds that poison communities like bad well water, I know I've been blessed. This place, for all its mundane facade, has been good to me. It has been home.",
            "The college stands near where I make my home, and that's good enough. Rows of tired buildings line the streets, their facades weathered like old bones in the sun, with taverns and eateries scattered among them like wayward children. They renamed one of the bars. Made it costly. Still serves the same poison.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes: scholars and the poor. All of them packed into these cheap dwellings like cattle in pens. Children too, countless of them, drawn to the schoolhouse that squats just beyond where the pavement ends. My neighbors are strangers and that's how it'll stay. They fill the halls with sweet smoke until management hung a plastic box that spits perfume across their door. A joke written in artificial pine.\n\nAncient buildings stand shoulder to shoulder, their insides gutted and remade while their faces tell tales of decades past. Down the road they've raised new apartments, raw wounds in the urban flesh, built quick and cheap but priced dear. A scam blessed by proximity to learning.\n\nThere's a place that serves food on paper, everything heated in boxes that hum. Across the way a gas station stands sentinel, its fluorescent glow a beacon for the desperate. The city came with their machines and tamed the road, laid new concrete like a clean blanket over old dirt. They planted grass in strips, as if nature could be parceled and contained.\n\nTrees crowd my building like mourners at a wake. Some fell to the saw, their stumps testament to their passing. Behind us lies another street, meaner and darker, where concrete crumbles and buildings wear their poverty like badges. Crime blooms there like nightshade, though it spreads its seeds across to our side too. The people come and go like desert winds, leaving no trace.\n\nBut it suits me. My wallet stays full enough, and I can walk to what I need. The buses come regular as heartbeats, carrying us to market and town like modern day traders following ancient routes.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches thrust forward like bleached bones, green metal roofs catching what's left of the sun. A cul-de-sac where people gather without purpose or plan, their children scrawling chalk prophecies on concrete while kites dance against clouds that billow white as cotton in late summer. Fields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the sky like ancient guardians of some forgotten time.\n\nThen the sirens came. They came with a wailing that spoke of something vast and terrible moving across the land. The dog, the small one, trembled against me in the porcelain tub while the big one paced and barked at shadows, refusing sanctuary. Outside the hail fell like God's own buckshot, pelting the earth with a fury that knew no mercy. The road steamed afterward like some great wounded beast, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five as if the world itself had caught fever and broken it.\n\nThe sun pierced the clouds and rain fell still, and there arose in the sky twin arcs of color like some divine covenant. People emerged from their shelters slow and cautious like creatures after flood. The women and children returned to their evening rituals, to their cooking and their playing, speaking in that slow southern drawl that flows like honey over warm bread.\n\nBehind the houses lies a pond not meant for swimming and beyond that fields where deer move like ghosts in the morning mist. A bullfrog sings his ancient song at dawn, competing with roosters that crow their existence into the void. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be forty years from anywhere. A donkey brays in the gloaming, his voice carrying across fields that haven't changed since before men came to name them. The houses may look alike but inside they hold different stories, different sizes, different truths. Some small as prison cells, others sprawling like the fields themselves. Found this place like finding an arrowhead in freshly plowed earth, unexpected and precious in its own way.",
            "Ten years now. Ten years in this place and the memories they come like ghosts in the night, haunting and pure. We came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, my sister and I and our parents who sought better things for us, better schools, better houses, things that folk called civilized. I wept then. The tears came unbidden like rain in summer storms.\n\nThe years passed as years do. Friends came. Enemies too. Neighbors remained strangers save for Mr. Glen and Dennis who lived beside us, their presence like old trees that had always been there. Mr. Glen wed again and we were there, all of us, watching the ceremony unfold like some ancient ritual. Ms. Veda in white, removing the garter, throwing it into the darkness where I caught it like some talisman of future promise. Marsharii danced with me that night. Never saw her after. The world takes what it takes.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out like some labyrinth of asphalt and dreams. GPS now tells me where to go but in those days Kason and Curtis and I would wander like pilgrims through the streets, playing our games, living in that eternal present that only youth knows. The park became my sanctuary. Still is. Nature speaks there in tongues older than man. I practice with sticks bought from hardware stores, wooden swords, balance exercises like some warrior monk seeking enlightenment in the suburban wilderness.\n\nTennis courts and basketball hoops stand sentinel, unused now but waiting. My father and Mr. Graves taught us tennis in those days, working us until sweat ran like rivers down our backs. The memory sits there like a photograph yellowing at the edges.\n\nThere are more stories. There are always more stories. They live in the corners of memory, in the shadows of streetlights, in the quiet moments between heartbeats. And somewhere out there, beyond the horizon of now, better things wait. They always do.",
            "The town aint much to look at. Just another spot on the map in South Carolina but it feeds more than its share. Johnston they call it and they paint their pride on the welcome sign declaring it Peach Capital of the World like some ancient proclamation. The land stretches out in plots of peach trees or cattle pasture, the houses set back from the road like afterthoughts in the vast expanse. Metal roofs gleam under the merciless summer sun, others wear crowns of gray shingle, all of them scattered like dice thrown across the countryside.\n\nIn the heart of it theres one stoplight swaying above a fourway crossing where commerce congregates in meager offerings. Three places to fill your belly: the Hong Kong run by a family who keeps to themselves, the Fiesta where Mexican music drifts through screendoors, and Garys where burgers sizzle on ancient grills. The pizza place died quiet-like some time back.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug stands like a sentinel of older times, known more for its cherry cola than its medicines. The IGA charges dear for groceries and most folks make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, leaving the IGA for desperate purchases. The Dollar General draws them in like moths to flame, from sunup to sundown they come and go with their plastic bags of necessity.\n\nA woman runs the furniture store called Possibilities, her name known to all, her two movers like disciples of comfort hauling sofas and beds across the county. Next door the pet groomer tends to the towns animals in a place called Clarks, washing and clipping and boarding them like some kind of domestic zookeeper.\n\nThe doctors both for man and beast keep their practices away from town center, small outposts of healing in the vastness. One school stands for the young ones but after fifth grade they scatter like seed to the next town over. No parks yet exist though they scratch at the earth now to make one, two and a half acres of promised recreation like some garden of Eden to draw new souls to this place.\n\nNothing much happens here. No picture shows or bowling alleys or gathering spots where youth might congregate. No playgrounds for the children or paths for dogs to walk. Just a town so small you might pass through it between blinks, like a dream half-remembered in the morning light.",
            "We live where the asphalt runs between two highways in the Tennessee south, a place where cars pass like migrating birds, their metal wings catching the sun. The neighborhood stands quiet save for the mechanical drone of passing vehicles. People here stay. They root deep like the old trees that were here before the houses came. They work their yards in ancient rhythms, pushing mowers in endless circles, raking leaves that fall like brown rain.\n\nThe house sits corner-wise to the street, watching. Always watching. Four souls dwell within. Man, woman, two girls whose ages mark time like tree rings, eleven and fourteen winters gone. We know the mechanical beasts that prowl these streets, their engines singing familiar songs. When strange ones come we mark them, note them, watch them pass.\n\nWalkers traverse the asphalt river, some with dogs that pull at their leads like conscience at the heart. Children pedal their wheeled contraptions, spinning circles in the dying light. We work from inside these walls, venturing out to play even when the sky weeps. The grill sends smoke signals from the wooden deck, meat-scent carrying on the wind like prayers.\n\nThe song of summer is the mower's growl, March through October, when the grass finally surrenders to the cold. Trees stand sentinel, their shadows pooling like old memories on the ground. Come autumn they shed their skin in brown drifts that we gather and burn, the smoke rising like souls to heaven. Winter comes seldom now, just the long slow death of fall stretching endless into spring.\n\nThe garage stands rear-guard, our front door like a forgotten tomb save for the rare knock that echoes through the halls. When the garage yawns open I work on the truck, metal on metal, grease-stained fingers turning wrenches while the neighborhood breathes around me. Holidays bring the strangers, kin-folk parking their mechanical steeds wherever asphalt offers quarter. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Mother's Day - they come and go like tides.\n\nThis place suits us well enough. If not for the river of cars flowing endless between the highways, it might be something close to perfect.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast and ancient thing, all dirt and emptiness, and we who live here know its true nature. Not like them others who come to visit and leave again. Brown is the color of everything here. When someone puts in grass you know they've sold their soul to the water company and there aint no coming back from that.\n\nI came here in the nineties when the houses stood apart like sentinels in the waste, each one watching the other from afar. Now they've multiplied like some concrete pestilence but still the desert holds them at bay. The city grows like a cancer but that's the way of things everywhere now. Good folk and bad folk both live here same as anywhere else. My part's got old people, quiet types who mind their business and wave from their porches in the evening heat.\n\nChain stores is what we got. Food for Less. Smart and Final. The fancy stores don't come here. Won't come here. Construction's the blood that runs through this place, men building more and more houses in the emptiness like they're trying to fill up something that don't want filling. Makes me uneasy. I left the big city to get away from all that.\n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and T-bar installation. My hands know the work like they know my own face.\n\nThe animals here, they're something else. Different creatures that God made special for this hardscrabble land. Lizards that look like the rocks they hide under. Bugs that could survive the end times. My young ones chase them around like it's some kind of holy mission. The desert's got its own kind of stark beauty that calls to certain folk. Makes them want to stay.\n\nThe county fair comes through sometimes. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like white scarves. Down at the museum they keep pieces of the old world. Indian things. Bones from the ground. Artifacts from when this place was young. All of it telling some story about how we came to be here, though the desert itself remembers longer than any of us ever will.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete plain, dormitories rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. This here aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might describe. No picket fences. No soccer moms. Just endless corridors of souls bound together in this academic purgatory.\n\nThe buildings stand testament to different tribes. Three kinds there are. First the apartments, stacked boxes of glass and steel where bodies pile two deep, four deep, sometimes more, floor upon floor like layers in some architectural cake of humanity. Twenty souls to a building near as I can reckon. Then there's them proper houses, scattered like afterthoughts across the grounds, where mostly old graduates hole up in twos and fours, clinging to some vestige of normalcy in this strange land. Last come the dormitories proper, great concrete behemoths swallowing hundreds whole, two to a cell save for them lucky few who managed solitude.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors, all ages, all walks. The learned ones, the professors and such, they claim them standalone houses like territory markers. The young ones, fresh-faced and raw, they pack into them dorms like cattle. The older students, they take to them apartments, having earned some semblance of dignity in their time here.\n\nMarkets and stores dot the landscape like oases in this academic desert. Food halls serving up sustenance. School stores hawking overpriced cloth bearing the institution's mark. Grocers keeping us fed. Everything a body might need contained within these borders, like some self-sufficient colony cut off from the world beyond.\n\nAnd there's the park. One single patch of green midst all this stone and steel. Kept clean by some unspoken law, watched over by all who call this place home. A sanctuary where all them diverse souls come to remember what the world beyond these walls feels like. Strange how such a place can become home, can become everything you know, everything you need.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it askew and my house stands sentinel at the peak where runners come to test themselves against the slope. They call it the workout hill. Just a name. Nothing more. The road beneath carries all who pass, its surface pocked and scarred like an old fighter's face. Above, the power lines hang like black rosary beads, patched and mended where storm and branch have done their violence. Their repairs a testament to man's endless war with weather.\n\nThe trees rise up everywhere. Evergreens tall as judgment. The people here hate them with a fury reserved for old enemies, cutting them down with mechanical precision, seeking always the water beyond. Houses stack themselves against the hill like wooden martyrs, their glass faces turned forever seaward, watching. At sunset the bay burns orange and gold as if lit from below by some ancient fire, though most days the clouds hang thick as wool and the light filters gray through the perpetual haze.\n\nMoss claims everything here. It grows without permission or purpose, coating the world in velvet green. Left my truck standing a month and found it transformed, wrapped in a funeral shroud of vegetation that took hours to strip away.\n\nNo children here. Just old folks waiting out their days and dogs that roam like spirits through the streets, entering houses unbidden as if they owned them. Once found one standing in my living room like it had always been there, watching me with eyes older than sin.\n\nRabbits too, big as cats, digging at the earth like miners searching for gold. My cats hunt them with ancient efficiency, their instincts unchanged since the world was young. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds small as thoughts, while hawks and eagles patrol until the crows drive them off like dark shepherds protecting their flock.\n\nDown at the water's edge where the restaurants serve up the day's catch, there ain't much beach to speak of. Just rocks that men throw into the water as if casting away their sins. The bay stretches out narrow as a grave, the far shore visible even through the mist like a promise you can't quite keep.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some vast concrete labyrinth, a place where the subway trains come screaming through the night like metal prophets. You'll find it sure enough. The city dont hide its wounds.\n\nThe streets pulse with a new blood now. Asian merchants have claimed their territory block by block, year by year, their storefronts blazing with neon signs in languages that dance like ancient runes. Supermarkets stand shoulder to shoulder, four within a stone's throw, their shelves heavy with goods strange and familiar. The laundromats hum their eternal song of spin cycles and steam.\n\nBut this aint no singular culture's domain. The neighborhood breathes with the mingled breath of a thousand histories, immigrants and their children and their children's children, all of them carrying their own particular darkness and light. The park stands renewed, a concrete paradise where children play at being children. Basketball courts stretch like connected graveyards, the thump of rubber on asphalt a heartbeat in the city's chest. Soccer fields spread green and wanting. The water fountain spits its offering to the summer gods while children dance in its spray.\n\nHouses stand two deep mostly, families stacked like cordwood against the cold. The streets speak their own language. Music bleeds from passing cars, engines roar their defiance at the dawn. Night brings its own breed of citizen, carrying whatever darkness they've borrowed from the void. They'll take what aint theirs if you let them. Violence sleeps light here, like some coiled thing waiting for the wrong word or look.\n\nThe neighborhood wears its scars like medals. Package thieves prowl like coyotes, taking what the porches offer up. Dog waste lies in wait like small brown landmines, ignored by their makers despite whatever laws man has put forth to prevent such things. The city's rules mean little here where the concrete meets the sky.\n\nWatch your step. Keep your eyes up. The city dont forgive carelessness.",
            "Portland Oregon aint about what you think it is. It's about the weird and what weird means aint what you think neither. There's a sign painted up on some building that serves pizza and music and flesh and lord knows what else and it says Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the future that's already come. Some folks'll tell you it's about remembering what was, back before the money came. Others'll say it's an invitation to come be strange in a place that dont mind strange. But weird aint what you think.\n\nThe Californians come with their money like locust clouds, building their glass towers toward a gray heaven that weeps nine months of the year. Still the weird persists. Not like acceptance exactly but like a tolerance for the intolerable. We got our Chinese goods same as anywhere. Got our yoga people and our coffee people and our business people in their pressed shirts moving through the streets like ghosts of some other civilization.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that'd shame a Mexican carnival. Gardens grow wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers pressing up through cracks in the concrete like nature making its last stand. And there's the boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to unknown gods. People put their castoffs in em but there's something holy about it, like every box might hold some revelation meant just for you. Clothes mostly. Books. But sometimes treasure.\n\nSome folks here'd rather do their stretching with goats - real goats mind you, not some metaphor - or watch men kick balls across a field while thousands scream. The rain comes down and the clouds hang low and the darkness gets in peoples heads. Makes em crazy sometimes. Makes em forget who they are. The addicted and the homeless congregate like pilgrims at some blighted shrine. The city tries to help em but it aint enough. Never is. The rest of us watch em, sometimes with pity, sometimes with hate, and in that we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stood there eternal. North. Silent witnesses to the sun's daily pilgrimage across the vault of heaven. A man could forget them in the mundane toil of his days but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Beyond the petty sufferings of men. And when the spirit grew weary they called out with voices that had no sound and in their presence the troubled soul found rest. Found strength enough to weather one more dawn.\n\nThe university lay in their shadow. Buildings of stone and brick where young minds sought knowledge or whatever simulacrum of it they could grasp. Ponds mirrored the sky. Trees older than any living memory spread their ancient limbs. But the mountains ruled over all like gods of stone.\n\nThe town spread below them like a supplicant. Cafes where students bent over books and machines drinking bitter draughts to ward off sleep. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks weathered to colors no living hand had painted. Here the pulse of the city beat strong as any metropolis but it didnt last. Past the library the quiet returned like an old dog to its familiar bed. These two worlds existed side by side like some cosmic joke about the nature of man's aspirations.\n\nMemories collected in the corners and alleyways like wind-blown leaves. Some sweet as summer wine shared with companions. Running through lamp-lit streets to catch pictures at the theater. Others bitter as medicine. The ponds at night. Two AM and the soul screaming questions at a universe that gave no answer. Watching lesser creatures live their ordained lives while purpose remained elusive as smoke.\n\nWalking north past houses that seemed to hide behind their own pretensions. The sun painting the sky in colors that had no names. Palm trees swaying like supplicants at prayer. And there they stood. Mountains older than time itself breaking the horizon like the spine of some great beast. Speaking without voice. Teaching without words the meaning of endurance.",
            "You'd walk past it and never know. Past the dead hulk of what was once a Whole Foods store, past the hotels where folk come and go like migratory birds in their seasons, there lies a world unknown. The buildings rise up like ancient monoliths, apartment complexes lined up careful and precise as bone fragments from some great beast laid out for study. First comes the one they speak of in whispers on the evening news, but we'll pass that by quick enough. Evil lives where it chooses and wears what face it will.\n\nBeyond there stand three more, different somehow, like a secret kept from the town that built them. Across the way sits the college, quiet as a church on Monday, where young souls drift in with their paper cups and their dreams still clinging to their eyelids like morning dew. The gates groan their protest at each passing, and the traffic builds up like bile in the throat of progress while workers curse the dawn and the students who herald it.\n\nWhere the road ends another begins, and there's the park on one side and the bone menders on the other, their porch furniture bright as false teeth, ceiling fan turning slow and methodical as God's own timepiece. Children spin through the grass like bright human pinwheels while bees work their ancient profession among the roadside blooms. Old men walk their dogs and eye the skateboard kids like they're studying some new species of trouble, nodding to the young girls who cluster like starlings and speak in voices that carry secrets.\n\nThe strip mall squats beside it all, holding its trinity of commerce - raw fish and chlorine and painted nails all in a row like some strange sacrament of suburban life. The yogurt shop stands at the end, its windows collecting fingerprints of the young who gather there with their sugared cups and their vapors, performing their rituals of youth on wheeled boards while time stands still as it always has in these southern places, these forgotten corners where America dreams its small dreams and wakes to find them unchanged.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames, bearing witness to times past and times coming. A small patch of earth marks the front, a strip of concrete the side, testament to dreams that once coursed through the veins of a nation like fever. Dreams that now recede like shadows at dusk, though their skeletal forms remain, crying out in mute supplication to those who'd listen that all aint lost, not yet.\n\nThe people here carry less hope in their eyes than their fathers did. Grass grows wild where once it was tamed, yet automobiles still rest in driveways like sleeping beasts and children play their games, unknowing that their world is but a fraction of what exists beyond. The school stands like an ancient monolith, ninety years of youth passing through its halls, each generation leaving ghosts for the old to remember. Churches stand empty save for dust and memory while basketball courts pulse with life and motion.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years. The market, Super A they call it, run by Yemeni folk, perhaps the only Arabs for miles around. Black faces populate the streets, generations deep in the soil here. Wide streets where children play at football, pausing only when metal carriages pass through their games. Old timers speak of days when names and faces were known to all, when community wasn't just a word but a living thing.\n\nWhere once stood a temple to martial arts now stands a dispensary of modern medicine, Hollywood's dreams having moved on to other things. The picture house remains, showing shadows of the past at cut-rate prices, shunned by the young but embraced by the old who find solace in its dimmed confines. A single highway cuts through like a concrete river, its tributaries emptying into neighboring towns, denied entrance here by elders who saw in its coming the death of something precious.\n\nThey speak now of mascots for the new school rising from the earth. Some say a mechanical man with a country drawl and pioneer dwelling would suit. Perhaps they're right. Perhaps not. The town abides either way.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, a concrete labyrinth where dwellings and commerce intermingle without pattern or purpose. Glass towers rise like ancient monoliths between squat buildings housing eateries and shops, their neon signs burning against the perpetual haze. The streets pulse with a ceaseless parade of humanity moving between corporate bastions and small storefronts that cling to existence like desert flowers in cracked pavement.\n\nThe parks stand as green islands in the urban waste, where mothers shepherd their young across worn paths while old men sit motionless on weathered benches watching nothing. The people here are a patchwork of tribes, each carrying their histories like invisible wounds. The rainbow folk claim their territory alongside black-clad Orthodox Jews, while scattered remnants of the fallen Soviet empire drift through the streets speaking in tongues of the steppes.\n\nBeyond the immediate borders lie other enclaves - Korea town, China town, Little Armenia - each a world contained within walls of language and custom. Ten miles might as well be a hundred in this maze of steel and exhaust where two hours can vanish crossing what a crow would traverse in minutes. Nobody walks. They sit sealed in their vehicles like ancient mariners in iron ships, drifting through seas of brake lights that stretch endless into the smog-stained horizon.\n\nThe city devours itself and grows, sprouting new towers from its own decay. The people watch and curse the coming of more people, more machines, more metal boxes to house the endless tide of humanity. Houses squat between the towers, some grand, some humble, some split like cells into duplexes where families stack upon families. They stand as testaments to older dreams, when people knew their neighbors and children played in streets not yet choked with cars and fear.\n\nThose days are gone now. The community exists only in memory, like smoke from a dead fire. The children who once played in these streets have grown and gone, leaving only ghosts of laughter that echo in empty yards where strange faces peer from windows, unknowing and unknown.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stretched out before them like a yellow sea touching the rim of the world. This is all there is, he said. He knew the emptiness would shake her. She'd come from somewhere else. Somewhere where food came easy and streets were paved and lit. She'd never seen the vastness that was rural Ohio laid bare before her like this.\n\nThey drove on. The macadam road narrow and black cutting through the endless fields like a wound. Past the old quarry now full of dark water that reflected nothing back. Then the houses began. Brick and stucco dwellings set back from the road, each on its own plot of land tended with a kind of desperate pride. In spring the flowers came. Store-bought things in neat rows and the native trees changing their clothes with each turn of the season. The driveways held German cars, their surfaces gleaming like wet stone in the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. An old doctor who'd lost some piece of himself to time. He rode his green machine in endless circles, singing songs no one knew the words to, his voice carrying over the mower's drone like some strange prayer. The neighbors watched him and smiled and shook their heads but he paid them no mind.\n\nPast his place was home. Geese gathered in the side yard where the little terrier gave futile chase. Behind the house ran the creek that fed the quarry, its voice mixing with the bullfrogs and the distant lowing of cattle. Across a bridge built by hand lay a wild place. Trees and herbs and flowers that no one had planted grew there in profusion. This was where the children came. Where they built their wooden castles in the trees and stalked imaginary prey through the undergrowth.\n\nWinter came hard to that place. The green world died and the trees stood like hanged men against the grey sky. But sometimes in the night the snow would come and transform everything. The yard would fill with the shapes of angels where his sister had lain and snowmen rose up like pale sentinels. The children built their fortifications then, packing snow into walls, gathering ammunition. They were warriors in a white world, fighting battles that meant everything and nothing at all. Just children in their own kingdom where time had no meaning and the future was as distant as the stars."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I dwell in the rural parts, in Michigan where the land stretches out between farms and them little tourist towns that dot the shores like broken shells. Aint no big stores here. No chains neither. Just empty roads that lead to somewhere else if you got the mind to follow them.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold everything together like God's own hands cupped around this piece of earth. Lake Michigan vast and grey to one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them ancient and deep and full of secrets. Beaches everywhere you turn, sand and stone waiting for feet to press their memories into them.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old men who've learned the value of distance. Each one different, each one carrying its years in different ways. Some got new faces put on them, others wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the earth like root cellars waiting for storms that aint come yet. The aluminum siding gone silver and dull in the sun, colors faded but still holding on. Every shade you could name and some you couldn't.\n\nYards spread out wide enough for dreams to grow. Trampolines standing like black circles against the sky, swing sets creaking their metal songs in the wind. Gardens where people plant hope every spring, fences holding dogs that bark at shadows.\n\nThese are working people's homes. The kind of folks who know what calluses mean and what time the sun comes up. Children run wild in the streets like scattered birds, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs and their people making their daily rounds, wheels turning on pavement, everybody knowing everybody else's business and keeping track of strangers.\n\nYou see someone cooking meat over fire, they raise a hand. Someone walking their dog from three streets over, they nod like they've known you all their life. The grass stays cut, the leaves don't pile up when autumn comes calling. Everything trimmed and neat but not proud about it.\n\nAint beautiful in the way that makes people stop and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes them want to stay. Quiet settles here like dust, and safety wraps around you like an old quilt. Got the sheriff's office walking distance away, and the jail right there with it like they was born twins. Health department too, and the place where they sort through what people throw away, trying to make something new from something old.\n\nYou can hear the ballgames echo across the evening, voices calling out names like they was reading from some holy book. Planes come and go from the little airport, their engines growling at the sky. Ice cream place aint far, and downtown waits just beyond that. Eight blocks to the park where children ride their bikes like they was chasing summer itself.\n\nThis here's a good place. A right place. The kind of place where the world makes sense if you let it.",
            "They built it all the same. Row after row of houses standing like sentries in the desert sun, each one a mirror of its neighbor, each yard a testament to some unseen authority's grip on order. The HOA they called it. Association of homeowners though none seemed to own anything but debt and obligation to sameness.\n\nYou drive in past the houses with their identical patches of grass, stones laid just so, driveways cut short like stillborn roads. Trees no taller than a man dot the landscape at measured intervals. Two-car garages stand silent, waiting. The concrete beneath your wheels still fresh and unmarked by time or weather, as if the earth itself feared to crack it.\n\nNo mailboxes stand sentinel before these homes. They cluster instead at street's end like metal soldiers in formation, each with its tiny brass key and lock. Above them two larger boxes for the packages that come. Modern life delivered in cardboard and tape.\n\nThe neighborhood sits at the city's edge where civilization meets wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land stretches vast and empty save for the pools they built, fenced and chlorinated against nature's intrusion. Walking trails wind through like veins in living tissue, carrying people and their dogs in endless circuits.\n\nThe old ones live here mostly. Retirees who've traded their years for security and sameness. Some younger folk too, with briefcases and tired eyes, but they're fewer. All watch each other's homes with the vigilance of prison guards, though there are no prisoners here save perhaps themselves.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own life. One mall stands like a concrete monolith, neither grand nor humble. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction leads to commerce - stores stacked with organic produce at prices that would shame a thief, or bare-shelved outlets where fluorescent lights hum their discount hymns over near-empty aisles.\n\nThey built it all to last, this neighborhood. Built it safe and clean and predictable as sunrise. The pools stay blue, the trails stay clear, the houses stay the same. And if sometimes in the night you hear the desert calling from beyond the development's edge, well, that's what walls are for.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through some voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through the ether like ancient spirits. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each moon cycle. None I knew had heard such tales. Maybe it's the weight of living that does it. Some friends weep in their beds come nightfall. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, dust-covered playthings and clothes gone yellow with age. The nose grows dull with the years. Might be the tobacco. Might be you just stop noticing after time enough passes.\n\nBut the fleamarket abides. Childhood dies in the smell of old paper stacked on dead pianos. The scent works its way into leather like original sin, no washing gets it out. Three stores dealing in cast-offs within walking distance. Start at the far end and you can walk through two charity shops, a library full of forgotten words, a place selling rare books, and a shop of curiosities. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but the thrift stores keep their silence like tombs. No matter the parade outside, inside stays quiet as a church. Good place to lose yourself. More folks come each year, more machines too. They call it progress. Some great digital empire planted its flag here, spreading like kudzu across the land. Makes me think of New York. Everyone carrying their own burden, asking nothing of nobody. A body can keep to themselves, quiet-like, and ain't nobody going to disturb that peace. Not like down South where concern passes for caring. Folk here don't dig into your business none.\n\nYou can keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like the tide. Place has life though. Got a piano player next door, two trying to be singers up above. Less strangers sharing walls than a kind of family. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths together, help each other through the dark times. Lucky, I reckon, to have landed here. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. We pass mail back and forth like peace offerings. Good to see them and I figure they feel the same. Living in this great concrete maze of modernity but it's folk like these make me think I ain't wasted my life after all.",
            "The town sits like a tired dog at the edge of the metropolis, neither city nor country, a place where the shadows of prosperity fall long and dark across the eastern streets where we make our home. Here the houses stand weathered and wanting, passed from hand to hand like worn dollar bills, their paint peeling in the summer heat and winter cold alike. But there aint no meanness here. Folk nod and speak when you pass. They carry their poverty like old coats, worn but dignified.\n\nViolence comes sometimes like a thief in the night. Gunshots have torn the darkness. Blood has marked these streets. The neighbors boy, not more than twenty, fell outside MacGregor's Bar last winter, his life seeping into black asphalt while music played inside. We've lost nothing save what the night people take from porches, small things left forgotten in the gloaming.\n\nThe poison that runs through the veins of America runs here too. Fentanyl. A word like a death sentence. Bodies found in doorways and alleys, souls departed on wings of synthetic dreams. The town fights back with clinics and training, teaching the living how to pull back the dead.\n\nThe school stands like a fortress of hope. My boy goes there, different from the others but loved all the same. No child hungry, no child marked by the sins of poverty. The teachers move through the halls like guardians, their calling written in chalk dust and patience.\n\nThe town council men pour money into the western streets like water on parched earth. New pavement gleaming. Parks with fresh paint. While here in the east we watch and wait, our streets collecting pools of rain and forgotten promises.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint much but it holds us. The walls know our voices. The floors remember our steps. Sometimes at night I stand on the porch and look west where the lights of the city proper paint the sky orange and purple. But this is home. This is where we'll stay until the darkness or the light takes us.",
            "The neighborhood sits high upon the hill like some ancient acropolis, its buildings worn and weathered sentinels of time long past. My dwelling, seven stories of concrete and steel, stands watch over the old theater house across the way, and down the slope there's a place where folk gather in the summer heat to play at games of light and sound. They come in droves when the air is thick with evening warmth, queuing like pilgrims before some neon shrine.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast as any urban expanse might be in such a place. Great concrete walls ring it round, steps carved like the marks of some forgotten giant's ascent. When winter comes the homeless gather there, their temporary cities risen in neat rows along the walls, canvas homes strung together against the wet and cold. The rain comes more often than snow, brutal and unrelenting in the dark months, and these souls huddle close in the city's heart rather than scatter to the wild margins where death comes easier. They stay near the shelter where water runs clean and warm, where they might wash away the day's grime.\n\nBut it aint the old architecture nor the proud buildings that makes this place sing. It's the blood memory of the streets themselves. Hilltop they call it, once known coast to coast for its violence, its gangs, its darkness. Old timers still speak of government men coming through like locusts, badges gleaming, trying to scrub these streets clean. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like myself.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though others still name it rough country. White folks get warned away after dark, though that's just echoes of old fears, prejudices carved deep as the hill itself. Maybe it's my own darkness that lets me pass unmarked, or maybe the hill knows its own, knows who understands its pain, its history of division and fear in this supposed paradise of cultures mixed.\n\nThis much I know: these streets are home. Here I've walked in darkness and found only kindness - a coat offered against the cold, a door held open when rain fell like judgment, a stranger's eyes meeting mine in my lowest moments, pressing currency in my palm and speaking words of worth into my emptiness. Here among these broken sidewalks and tired buildings, I found my place in the world.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade commenced, when the air was thick and heavy like molasses and the streets lay empty save for the occasional wandering dog. Making friends dont come easy to a boy in a strange land but there were two others, one who dwelled two doors down and another who lived along the same stretch of asphalt, though both are gone now, scattered like leaves in an autumn wind. Their ghosts remain.\n\nThe houses stand two stories tall, uniform and patient, watching. The same folk who were here when I first arrived still abide, their presence as constant as the seasons. Children's voices carry on the warm air, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and concrete driveways like some ancient ritual of youth. The neighborhood keeps its own counsel most days, quiet as a church mouse.\n\nThere's a park nearby, not more than a minute's walk through territory that feels both foreign and familiar. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked courts where we played our games, the concrete witness to countless victories and defeats. Got my nose broke there once, catching an elbow in a football game, the blood bright and shocking against the grey pavement. But that's just one tale among many.\n\nNow I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them climb and swing like small monkeys in a steel jungle. Their joy is pure and unfiltered, like light through clean glass. The park holds memories like a vessel holds water, some sweet, some bitter.\n\nThe neighborhood is a patchwork quilt of cultures, each square stitched tight against the other. Food from all corners of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though nowadays folk summon their sustenance through glowing rectangles and waiting drivers. Fast food joints sprout like weeds along the roadside, and pizza parlors stand guard on every corner.\n\nStores line the streets like teeth in a jaw. Two pharmacies face each other across the asphalt like duelists, while the Jewel-Osco holds court nearby, its fluorescent kingdom a beacon in the Midwestern night. An Indian store stands apart, its shelves heavy with spices and secrets from across the ocean.\n\nWhen I read of the tribulations others endure with their neighbors, of the small wars fought across property lines and the bitter feuds that poison communities like bad well water, I know I've been blessed. This place, for all its mundane facade, has been good to me. It has been home.",
            "The college stands near where I make my home, and that's good enough. Rows of tired buildings line the streets, their facades weathered like old bones in the sun, with taverns and eateries scattered among them like wayward children. They renamed one of the bars. Made it costly. Still serves the same poison.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes: scholars and the poor. All of them packed into these cheap dwellings like cattle in pens. Children too, countless of them, drawn to the schoolhouse that squats just beyond where the pavement ends. My neighbors are strangers and that's how it'll stay. They fill the halls with sweet smoke until management hung a plastic box that spits perfume across their door. A joke written in artificial pine.\n\nAncient buildings stand shoulder to shoulder, their insides gutted and remade while their faces tell tales of decades past. Down the road they've raised new apartments, raw wounds in the urban flesh, built quick and cheap but priced dear. A scam blessed by proximity to learning.\n\nThere's a place that serves food on paper, everything heated in boxes that hum. Across the way a gas station stands sentinel, its fluorescent glow a beacon for the desperate. The city came with their machines and tamed the road, laid new concrete like a clean blanket over old dirt. They planted grass in strips, as if nature could be parceled and contained.\n\nTrees crowd my building like mourners at a wake. Some fell to the saw, their stumps testament to their passing. Behind us lies another street, meaner and darker, where concrete crumbles and buildings wear their poverty like badges. Crime blooms there like nightshade, though it spreads its seeds across to our side too. The people come and go like desert winds, leaving no trace.\n\nBut it suits me. My wallet stays full enough, and I can walk to what I need. The buses come regular as heartbeats, carrying us to market and town like modern day traders following ancient routes.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches thrust forward like bleached bones, green metal roofs catching what's left of the sun. A cul-de-sac where people gather without purpose or plan, their children scrawling chalk prophecies on concrete while kites dance against clouds that billow white as cotton in late summer. Fields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the sky like ancient guardians of some forgotten time.\n\nThen the sirens came. They came with a wailing that spoke of something vast and terrible moving across the land. The dog, the small one, trembled against me in the porcelain tub while the big one paced and barked at shadows, refusing sanctuary. Outside the hail fell like God's own buckshot, pelting the earth with a fury that knew no mercy. The road steamed afterward like some great wounded beast, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five as if the world itself had caught fever and broken it.\n\nThe sun pierced the clouds and rain fell still, and there arose in the sky twin arcs of color like some divine covenant. People emerged from their shelters slow and cautious like creatures after flood. The women and children returned to their evening rituals, to their cooking and their playing, speaking in that slow southern drawl that flows like honey over warm bread.\n\nBehind the houses lies a pond not meant for swimming and beyond that fields where deer move like ghosts in the morning mist. A bullfrog sings his ancient song at dawn, competing with roosters that crow their existence into the void. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be forty years from anywhere. A donkey brays in the gloaming, his voice carrying across fields that haven't changed since before men came to name them. The houses may look alike but inside they hold different stories, different sizes, different truths. Some small as prison cells, others sprawling like the fields themselves. Found this place like finding an arrowhead in freshly plowed earth, unexpected and precious in its own way.",
            "Ten years now. Ten years in this place and the memories they come like ghosts in the night, haunting and pure. We came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, my sister and I and our parents who sought better things for us, better schools, better houses, things that folk called civilized. I wept then. The tears came unbidden like rain in summer storms.\n\nThe years passed as years do. Friends came. Enemies too. Neighbors remained strangers save for Mr. Glen and Dennis who lived beside us, their presence like old trees that had always been there. Mr. Glen wed again and we were there, all of us, watching the ceremony unfold like some ancient ritual. Ms. Veda in white, removing the garter, throwing it into the darkness where I caught it like some talisman of future promise. Marsharii danced with me that night. Never saw her after. The world takes what it takes.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out like some labyrinth of asphalt and dreams. GPS now tells me where to go but in those days Kason and Curtis and I would wander like pilgrims through the streets, playing our games, living in that eternal present that only youth knows. The park became my sanctuary. Still is. Nature speaks there in tongues older than man. I practice with sticks bought from hardware stores, wooden swords, balance exercises like some warrior monk seeking enlightenment in the suburban wilderness.\n\nTennis courts and basketball hoops stand sentinel, unused now but waiting. My father and Mr. Graves taught us tennis in those days, working us until sweat ran like rivers down our backs. The memory sits there like a photograph yellowing at the edges.\n\nThere are more stories. There are always more stories. They live in the corners of memory, in the shadows of streetlights, in the quiet moments between heartbeats. And somewhere out there, beyond the horizon of now, better things wait. They always do.",
            "The town aint much to look at. Just another spot on the map in South Carolina but it feeds more than its share. Johnston they call it and they paint their pride on the welcome sign declaring it Peach Capital of the World like some ancient proclamation. The land stretches out in plots of peach trees or cattle pasture, the houses set back from the road like afterthoughts in the vast expanse. Metal roofs gleam under the merciless summer sun, others wear crowns of gray shingle, all of them scattered like dice thrown across the countryside.\n\nIn the heart of it theres one stoplight swaying above a fourway crossing where commerce congregates in meager offerings. Three places to fill your belly: the Hong Kong run by a family who keeps to themselves, the Fiesta where Mexican music drifts through screendoors, and Garys where burgers sizzle on ancient grills. The pizza place died quiet-like some time back.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug stands like a sentinel of older times, known more for its cherry cola than its medicines. The IGA charges dear for groceries and most folks make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, leaving the IGA for desperate purchases. The Dollar General draws them in like moths to flame, from sunup to sundown they come and go with their plastic bags of necessity.\n\nA woman runs the furniture store called Possibilities, her name known to all, her two movers like disciples of comfort hauling sofas and beds across the county. Next door the pet groomer tends to the towns animals in a place called Clarks, washing and clipping and boarding them like some kind of domestic zookeeper.\n\nThe doctors both for man and beast keep their practices away from town center, small outposts of healing in the vastness. One school stands for the young ones but after fifth grade they scatter like seed to the next town over. No parks yet exist though they scratch at the earth now to make one, two and a half acres of promised recreation like some garden of Eden to draw new souls to this place.\n\nNothing much happens here. No picture shows or bowling alleys or gathering spots where youth might congregate. No playgrounds for the children or paths for dogs to walk. Just a town so small you might pass through it between blinks, like a dream half-remembered in the morning light.",
            "We live where the asphalt runs between two highways in the Tennessee south, a place where cars pass like migrating birds, their metal wings catching the sun. The neighborhood stands quiet save for the mechanical drone of passing vehicles. People here stay. They root deep like the old trees that were here before the houses came. They work their yards in ancient rhythms, pushing mowers in endless circles, raking leaves that fall like brown rain.\n\nThe house sits corner-wise to the street, watching. Always watching. Four souls dwell within. Man, woman, two girls whose ages mark time like tree rings, eleven and fourteen winters gone. We know the mechanical beasts that prowl these streets, their engines singing familiar songs. When strange ones come we mark them, note them, watch them pass.\n\nWalkers traverse the asphalt river, some with dogs that pull at their leads like conscience at the heart. Children pedal their wheeled contraptions, spinning circles in the dying light. We work from inside these walls, venturing out to play even when the sky weeps. The grill sends smoke signals from the wooden deck, meat-scent carrying on the wind like prayers.\n\nThe song of summer is the mower's growl, March through October, when the grass finally surrenders to the cold. Trees stand sentinel, their shadows pooling like old memories on the ground. Come autumn they shed their skin in brown drifts that we gather and burn, the smoke rising like souls to heaven. Winter comes seldom now, just the long slow death of fall stretching endless into spring.\n\nThe garage stands rear-guard, our front door like a forgotten tomb save for the rare knock that echoes through the halls. When the garage yawns open I work on the truck, metal on metal, grease-stained fingers turning wrenches while the neighborhood breathes around me. Holidays bring the strangers, kin-folk parking their mechanical steeds wherever asphalt offers quarter. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Mother's Day - they come and go like tides.\n\nThis place suits us well enough. If not for the river of cars flowing endless between the highways, it might be something close to perfect.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast and ancient thing, all dirt and emptiness, and we who live here know its true nature. Not like them others who come to visit and leave again. Brown is the color of everything here. When someone puts in grass you know they've sold their soul to the water company and there aint no coming back from that.\n\nI came here in the nineties when the houses stood apart like sentinels in the waste, each one watching the other from afar. Now they've multiplied like some concrete pestilence but still the desert holds them at bay. The city grows like a cancer but that's the way of things everywhere now. Good folk and bad folk both live here same as anywhere else. My part's got old people, quiet types who mind their business and wave from their porches in the evening heat.\n\nChain stores is what we got. Food for Less. Smart and Final. The fancy stores don't come here. Won't come here. Construction's the blood that runs through this place, men building more and more houses in the emptiness like they're trying to fill up something that don't want filling. Makes me uneasy. I left the big city to get away from all that.\n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and T-bar installation. My hands know the work like they know my own face.\n\nThe animals here, they're something else. Different creatures that God made special for this hardscrabble land. Lizards that look like the rocks they hide under. Bugs that could survive the end times. My young ones chase them around like it's some kind of holy mission. The desert's got its own kind of stark beauty that calls to certain folk. Makes them want to stay.\n\nThe county fair comes through sometimes. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like white scarves. Down at the museum they keep pieces of the old world. Indian things. Bones from the ground. Artifacts from when this place was young. All of it telling some story about how we came to be here, though the desert itself remembers longer than any of us ever will.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete plain, dormitories rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. This here aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might describe. No picket fences. No soccer moms. Just endless corridors of souls bound together in this academic purgatory.\n\nThe buildings stand testament to different tribes. Three kinds there are. First the apartments, stacked boxes of glass and steel where bodies pile two deep, four deep, sometimes more, floor upon floor like layers in some architectural cake of humanity. Twenty souls to a building near as I can reckon. Then there's them proper houses, scattered like afterthoughts across the grounds, where mostly old graduates hole up in twos and fours, clinging to some vestige of normalcy in this strange land. Last come the dormitories proper, great concrete behemoths swallowing hundreds whole, two to a cell save for them lucky few who managed solitude.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors, all ages, all walks. The learned ones, the professors and such, they claim them standalone houses like territory markers. The young ones, fresh-faced and raw, they pack into them dorms like cattle. The older students, they take to them apartments, having earned some semblance of dignity in their time here.\n\nMarkets and stores dot the landscape like oases in this academic desert. Food halls serving up sustenance. School stores hawking overpriced cloth bearing the institution's mark. Grocers keeping us fed. Everything a body might need contained within these borders, like some self-sufficient colony cut off from the world beyond.\n\nAnd there's the park. One single patch of green midst all this stone and steel. Kept clean by some unspoken law, watched over by all who call this place home. A sanctuary where all them diverse souls come to remember what the world beyond these walls feels like. Strange how such a place can become home, can become everything you know, everything you need.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it askew and my house stands sentinel at the peak where runners come to test themselves against the slope. They call it the workout hill. Just a name. Nothing more. The road beneath carries all who pass, its surface pocked and scarred like an old fighter's face. Above, the power lines hang like black rosary beads, patched and mended where storm and branch have done their violence. Their repairs a testament to man's endless war with weather.\n\nThe trees rise up everywhere. Evergreens tall as judgment. The people here hate them with a fury reserved for old enemies, cutting them down with mechanical precision, seeking always the water beyond. Houses stack themselves against the hill like wooden martyrs, their glass faces turned forever seaward, watching. At sunset the bay burns orange and gold as if lit from below by some ancient fire, though most days the clouds hang thick as wool and the light filters gray through the perpetual haze.\n\nMoss claims everything here. It grows without permission or purpose, coating the world in velvet green. Left my truck standing a month and found it transformed, wrapped in a funeral shroud of vegetation that took hours to strip away.\n\nNo children here. Just old folks waiting out their days and dogs that roam like spirits through the streets, entering houses unbidden as if they owned them. Once found one standing in my living room like it had always been there, watching me with eyes older than sin.\n\nRabbits too, big as cats, digging at the earth like miners searching for gold. My cats hunt them with ancient efficiency, their instincts unchanged since the world was young. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds small as thoughts, while hawks and eagles patrol until the crows drive them off like dark shepherds protecting their flock.\n\nDown at the water's edge where the restaurants serve up the day's catch, there ain't much beach to speak of. Just rocks that men throw into the water as if casting away their sins. The bay stretches out narrow as a grave, the far shore visible even through the mist like a promise you can't quite keep.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some vast concrete labyrinth, a place where the subway trains come screaming through the night like metal prophets. You'll find it sure enough. The city dont hide its wounds.\n\nThe streets pulse with a new blood now. Asian merchants have claimed their territory block by block, year by year, their storefronts blazing with neon signs in languages that dance like ancient runes. Supermarkets stand shoulder to shoulder, four within a stone's throw, their shelves heavy with goods strange and familiar. The laundromats hum their eternal song of spin cycles and steam.\n\nBut this aint no singular culture's domain. The neighborhood breathes with the mingled breath of a thousand histories, immigrants and their children and their children's children, all of them carrying their own particular darkness and light. The park stands renewed, a concrete paradise where children play at being children. Basketball courts stretch like connected graveyards, the thump of rubber on asphalt a heartbeat in the city's chest. Soccer fields spread green and wanting. The water fountain spits its offering to the summer gods while children dance in its spray.\n\nHouses stand two deep mostly, families stacked like cordwood against the cold. The streets speak their own language. Music bleeds from passing cars, engines roar their defiance at the dawn. Night brings its own breed of citizen, carrying whatever darkness they've borrowed from the void. They'll take what aint theirs if you let them. Violence sleeps light here, like some coiled thing waiting for the wrong word or look.\n\nThe neighborhood wears its scars like medals. Package thieves prowl like coyotes, taking what the porches offer up. Dog waste lies in wait like small brown landmines, ignored by their makers despite whatever laws man has put forth to prevent such things. The city's rules mean little here where the concrete meets the sky.\n\nWatch your step. Keep your eyes up. The city dont forgive carelessness.",
            "Portland Oregon aint about what you think it is. It's about the weird and what weird means aint what you think neither. There's a sign painted up on some building that serves pizza and music and flesh and lord knows what else and it says Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the future that's already come. Some folks'll tell you it's about remembering what was, back before the money came. Others'll say it's an invitation to come be strange in a place that dont mind strange. But weird aint what you think.\n\nThe Californians come with their money like locust clouds, building their glass towers toward a gray heaven that weeps nine months of the year. Still the weird persists. Not like acceptance exactly but like a tolerance for the intolerable. We got our Chinese goods same as anywhere. Got our yoga people and our coffee people and our business people in their pressed shirts moving through the streets like ghosts of some other civilization.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that'd shame a Mexican carnival. Gardens grow wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers pressing up through cracks in the concrete like nature making its last stand. And there's the boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to unknown gods. People put their castoffs in em but there's something holy about it, like every box might hold some revelation meant just for you. Clothes mostly. Books. But sometimes treasure.\n\nSome folks here'd rather do their stretching with goats - real goats mind you, not some metaphor - or watch men kick balls across a field while thousands scream. The rain comes down and the clouds hang low and the darkness gets in peoples heads. Makes em crazy sometimes. Makes em forget who they are. The addicted and the homeless congregate like pilgrims at some blighted shrine. The city tries to help em but it aint enough. Never is. The rest of us watch em, sometimes with pity, sometimes with hate, and in that we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stood there eternal. North. Silent witnesses to the sun's daily pilgrimage across the vault of heaven. A man could forget them in the mundane toil of his days but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Beyond the petty sufferings of men. And when the spirit grew weary they called out with voices that had no sound and in their presence the troubled soul found rest. Found strength enough to weather one more dawn.\n\nThe university lay in their shadow. Buildings of stone and brick where young minds sought knowledge or whatever simulacrum of it they could grasp. Ponds mirrored the sky. Trees older than any living memory spread their ancient limbs. But the mountains ruled over all like gods of stone.\n\nThe town spread below them like a supplicant. Cafes where students bent over books and machines drinking bitter draughts to ward off sleep. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks weathered to colors no living hand had painted. Here the pulse of the city beat strong as any metropolis but it didnt last. Past the library the quiet returned like an old dog to its familiar bed. These two worlds existed side by side like some cosmic joke about the nature of man's aspirations.\n\nMemories collected in the corners and alleyways like wind-blown leaves. Some sweet as summer wine shared with companions. Running through lamp-lit streets to catch pictures at the theater. Others bitter as medicine. The ponds at night. Two AM and the soul screaming questions at a universe that gave no answer. Watching lesser creatures live their ordained lives while purpose remained elusive as smoke.\n\nWalking north past houses that seemed to hide behind their own pretensions. The sun painting the sky in colors that had no names. Palm trees swaying like supplicants at prayer. And there they stood. Mountains older than time itself breaking the horizon like the spine of some great beast. Speaking without voice. Teaching without words the meaning of endurance.",
            "You'd walk past it and never know. Past the dead hulk of what was once a Whole Foods store, past the hotels where folk come and go like migratory birds in their seasons, there lies a world unknown. The buildings rise up like ancient monoliths, apartment complexes lined up careful and precise as bone fragments from some great beast laid out for study. First comes the one they speak of in whispers on the evening news, but we'll pass that by quick enough. Evil lives where it chooses and wears what face it will.\n\nBeyond there stand three more, different somehow, like a secret kept from the town that built them. Across the way sits the college, quiet as a church on Monday, where young souls drift in with their paper cups and their dreams still clinging to their eyelids like morning dew. The gates groan their protest at each passing, and the traffic builds up like bile in the throat of progress while workers curse the dawn and the students who herald it.\n\nWhere the road ends another begins, and there's the park on one side and the bone menders on the other, their porch furniture bright as false teeth, ceiling fan turning slow and methodical as God's own timepiece. Children spin through the grass like bright human pinwheels while bees work their ancient profession among the roadside blooms. Old men walk their dogs and eye the skateboard kids like they're studying some new species of trouble, nodding to the young girls who cluster like starlings and speak in voices that carry secrets.\n\nThe strip mall squats beside it all, holding its trinity of commerce - raw fish and chlorine and painted nails all in a row like some strange sacrament of suburban life. The yogurt shop stands at the end, its windows collecting fingerprints of the young who gather there with their sugared cups and their vapors, performing their rituals of youth on wheeled boards while time stands still as it always has in these southern places, these forgotten corners where America dreams its small dreams and wakes to find them unchanged.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames, bearing witness to times past and times coming. A small patch of earth marks the front, a strip of concrete the side, testament to dreams that once coursed through the veins of a nation like fever. Dreams that now recede like shadows at dusk, though their skeletal forms remain, crying out in mute supplication to those who'd listen that all aint lost, not yet.\n\nThe people here carry less hope in their eyes than their fathers did. Grass grows wild where once it was tamed, yet automobiles still rest in driveways like sleeping beasts and children play their games, unknowing that their world is but a fraction of what exists beyond. The school stands like an ancient monolith, ninety years of youth passing through its halls, each generation leaving ghosts for the old to remember. Churches stand empty save for dust and memory while basketball courts pulse with life and motion.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years. The market, Super A they call it, run by Yemeni folk, perhaps the only Arabs for miles around. Black faces populate the streets, generations deep in the soil here. Wide streets where children play at football, pausing only when metal carriages pass through their games. Old timers speak of days when names and faces were known to all, when community wasn't just a word but a living thing.\n\nWhere once stood a temple to martial arts now stands a dispensary of modern medicine, Hollywood's dreams having moved on to other things. The picture house remains, showing shadows of the past at cut-rate prices, shunned by the young but embraced by the old who find solace in its dimmed confines. A single highway cuts through like a concrete river, its tributaries emptying into neighboring towns, denied entrance here by elders who saw in its coming the death of something precious.\n\nThey speak now of mascots for the new school rising from the earth. Some say a mechanical man with a country drawl and pioneer dwelling would suit. Perhaps they're right. Perhaps not. The town abides either way.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, a concrete labyrinth where dwellings and commerce intermingle without pattern or purpose. Glass towers rise like ancient monoliths between squat buildings housing eateries and shops, their neon signs burning against the perpetual haze. The streets pulse with a ceaseless parade of humanity moving between corporate bastions and small storefronts that cling to existence like desert flowers in cracked pavement.\n\nThe parks stand as green islands in the urban waste, where mothers shepherd their young across worn paths while old men sit motionless on weathered benches watching nothing. The people here are a patchwork of tribes, each carrying their histories like invisible wounds. The rainbow folk claim their territory alongside black-clad Orthodox Jews, while scattered remnants of the fallen Soviet empire drift through the streets speaking in tongues of the steppes.\n\nBeyond the immediate borders lie other enclaves - Korea town, China town, Little Armenia - each a world contained within walls of language and custom. Ten miles might as well be a hundred in this maze of steel and exhaust where two hours can vanish crossing what a crow would traverse in minutes. Nobody walks. They sit sealed in their vehicles like ancient mariners in iron ships, drifting through seas of brake lights that stretch endless into the smog-stained horizon.\n\nThe city devours itself and grows, sprouting new towers from its own decay. The people watch and curse the coming of more people, more machines, more metal boxes to house the endless tide of humanity. Houses squat between the towers, some grand, some humble, some split like cells into duplexes where families stack upon families. They stand as testaments to older dreams, when people knew their neighbors and children played in streets not yet choked with cars and fear.\n\nThose days are gone now. The community exists only in memory, like smoke from a dead fire. The children who once played in these streets have grown and gone, leaving only ghosts of laughter that echo in empty yards where strange faces peer from windows, unknowing and unknown.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stretched out before them like a yellow sea touching the rim of the world. This is all there is, he said. He knew the emptiness would shake her. She'd come from somewhere else. Somewhere where food came easy and streets were paved and lit. She'd never seen the vastness that was rural Ohio laid bare before her like this.\n\nThey drove on. The macadam road narrow and black cutting through the endless fields like a wound. Past the old quarry now full of dark water that reflected nothing back. Then the houses began. Brick and stucco dwellings set back from the road, each on its own plot of land tended with a kind of desperate pride. In spring the flowers came. Store-bought things in neat rows and the native trees changing their clothes with each turn of the season. The driveways held German cars, their surfaces gleaming like wet stone in the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. An old doctor who'd lost some piece of himself to time. He rode his green machine in endless circles, singing songs no one knew the words to, his voice carrying over the mower's drone like some strange prayer. The neighbors watched him and smiled and shook their heads but he paid them no mind.\n\nPast his place was home. Geese gathered in the side yard where the little terrier gave futile chase. Behind the house ran the creek that fed the quarry, its voice mixing with the bullfrogs and the distant lowing of cattle. Across a bridge built by hand lay a wild place. Trees and herbs and flowers that no one had planted grew there in profusion. This was where the children came. Where they built their wooden castles in the trees and stalked imaginary prey through the undergrowth.\n\nWinter came hard to that place. The green world died and the trees stood like hanged men against the grey sky. But sometimes in the night the snow would come and transform everything. The yard would fill with the shapes of angels where his sister had lain and snowmen rose up like pale sentinels. The children built their fortifications then, packing snow into walls, gathering ammunition. They were warriors in a white world, fighting battles that meant everything and nothing at all. Just children in their own kingdom where time had no meaning and the future was as distant as the stars."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I dwell in the rural parts, in Michigan where the land stretches out between farms and them little tourist towns that dot the shores like broken shells. Aint no big stores here. No chains neither. Just empty roads that lead to somewhere else if you got the mind to follow them.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold everything together like God's own hands cupped around this piece of earth. Lake Michigan vast and grey to one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them ancient and deep and full of secrets. Beaches everywhere you turn, sand and stone waiting for feet to press their memories into them.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old men who've learned the value of distance. Each one different, each one carrying its years in different ways. Some got new faces put on them, others wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the earth like root cellars waiting for storms that aint come yet. The aluminum siding gone silver and dull in the sun, colors faded but still holding on. Every shade you could name and some you couldn't.\n\nYards spread out wide enough for dreams to grow. Trampolines standing like black circles against the sky, swing sets creaking their metal songs in the wind. Gardens where people plant hope every spring, fences holding dogs that bark at shadows.\n\nThese are working people's homes. The kind of folks who know what calluses mean and what time the sun comes up. Children run wild in the streets like scattered birds, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs and their people making their daily rounds, wheels turning on pavement, everybody knowing everybody else's business and keeping track of strangers.\n\nYou see someone cooking meat over fire, they raise a hand. Someone walking their dog from three streets over, they nod like they've known you all their life. The grass stays cut, the leaves don't pile up when autumn comes calling. Everything trimmed and neat but not proud about it.\n\nAint beautiful in the way that makes people stop and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes them want to stay. Quiet settles here like dust, and safety wraps around you like an old quilt. Got the sheriff's office walking distance away, and the jail right there with it like they was born twins. Health department too, and the place where they sort through what people throw away, trying to make something new from something old.\n\nYou can hear the ballgames echo across the evening, voices calling out names like they was reading from some holy book. Planes come and go from the little airport, their engines growling at the sky. Ice cream place aint far, and downtown waits just beyond that. Eight blocks to the park where children ride their bikes like they was chasing summer itself.\n\nThis here's a good place. A right place. The kind of place where the world makes sense if you let it.",
            "They built it all the same. Row after row of houses standing like sentries in the desert sun, each one a mirror of its neighbor, each yard a testament to some unseen authority's grip on order. The HOA they called it. Association of homeowners though none seemed to own anything but debt and obligation to sameness.\n\nYou drive in past the houses with their identical patches of grass, stones laid just so, driveways cut short like stillborn roads. Trees no taller than a man dot the landscape at measured intervals. Two-car garages stand silent, waiting. The concrete beneath your wheels still fresh and unmarked by time or weather, as if the earth itself feared to crack it.\n\nNo mailboxes stand sentinel before these homes. They cluster instead at street's end like metal soldiers in formation, each with its tiny brass key and lock. Above them two larger boxes for the packages that come. Modern life delivered in cardboard and tape.\n\nThe neighborhood sits at the city's edge where civilization meets wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land stretches vast and empty save for the pools they built, fenced and chlorinated against nature's intrusion. Walking trails wind through like veins in living tissue, carrying people and their dogs in endless circuits.\n\nThe old ones live here mostly. Retirees who've traded their years for security and sameness. Some younger folk too, with briefcases and tired eyes, but they're fewer. All watch each other's homes with the vigilance of prison guards, though there are no prisoners here save perhaps themselves.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own life. One mall stands like a concrete monolith, neither grand nor humble. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction leads to commerce - stores stacked with organic produce at prices that would shame a thief, or bare-shelved outlets where fluorescent lights hum their discount hymns over near-empty aisles.\n\nThey built it all to last, this neighborhood. Built it safe and clean and predictable as sunrise. The pools stay blue, the trails stay clear, the houses stay the same. And if sometimes in the night you hear the desert calling from beyond the development's edge, well, that's what walls are for.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through some voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through the ether like ancient spirits. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each moon cycle. None I knew had heard such tales. Maybe it's the weight of living that does it. Some friends weep in their beds come nightfall. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, dust-covered playthings and clothes gone yellow with age. The nose grows dull with the years. Might be the tobacco. Might be you just stop noticing after time enough passes.\n\nBut the fleamarket abides. Childhood dies in the smell of old paper stacked on dead pianos. The scent works its way into leather like original sin, no washing gets it out. Three stores dealing in cast-offs within walking distance. Start at the far end and you can walk through two charity shops, a library full of forgotten words, a place selling rare books, and a shop of curiosities. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but the thrift stores keep their silence like tombs. No matter the parade outside, inside stays quiet as a church. Good place to lose yourself. More folks come each year, more machines too. They call it progress. Some great digital empire planted its flag here, spreading like kudzu across the land. Makes me think of New York. Everyone carrying their own burden, asking nothing of nobody. A body can keep to themselves, quiet-like, and ain't nobody going to disturb that peace. Not like down South where concern passes for caring. Folk here don't dig into your business none.\n\nYou can keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like the tide. Place has life though. Got a piano player next door, two trying to be singers up above. Less strangers sharing walls than a kind of family. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths together, help each other through the dark times. Lucky, I reckon, to have landed here. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. We pass mail back and forth like peace offerings. Good to see them and I figure they feel the same. Living in this great concrete maze of modernity but it's folk like these make me think I ain't wasted my life after all.",
            "The town sits like a tired dog at the edge of the metropolis, neither city nor country, a place where the shadows of prosperity fall long and dark across the eastern streets where we make our home. Here the houses stand weathered and wanting, passed from hand to hand like worn dollar bills, their paint peeling in the summer heat and winter cold alike. But there aint no meanness here. Folk nod and speak when you pass. They carry their poverty like old coats, worn but dignified.\n\nViolence comes sometimes like a thief in the night. Gunshots have torn the darkness. Blood has marked these streets. The neighbors boy, not more than twenty, fell outside MacGregor's Bar last winter, his life seeping into black asphalt while music played inside. We've lost nothing save what the night people take from porches, small things left forgotten in the gloaming.\n\nThe poison that runs through the veins of America runs here too. Fentanyl. A word like a death sentence. Bodies found in doorways and alleys, souls departed on wings of synthetic dreams. The town fights back with clinics and training, teaching the living how to pull back the dead.\n\nThe school stands like a fortress of hope. My boy goes there, different from the others but loved all the same. No child hungry, no child marked by the sins of poverty. The teachers move through the halls like guardians, their calling written in chalk dust and patience.\n\nThe town council men pour money into the western streets like water on parched earth. New pavement gleaming. Parks with fresh paint. While here in the east we watch and wait, our streets collecting pools of rain and forgotten promises.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint much but it holds us. The walls know our voices. The floors remember our steps. Sometimes at night I stand on the porch and look west where the lights of the city proper paint the sky orange and purple. But this is home. This is where we'll stay until the darkness or the light takes us.",
            "The neighborhood sits high upon the hill like some ancient acropolis, its buildings worn and weathered sentinels of time long past. My dwelling, seven stories of concrete and steel, stands watch over the old theater house across the way, and down the slope there's a place where folk gather in the summer heat to play at games of light and sound. They come in droves when the air is thick with evening warmth, queuing like pilgrims before some neon shrine.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast as any urban expanse might be in such a place. Great concrete walls ring it round, steps carved like the marks of some forgotten giant's ascent. When winter comes the homeless gather there, their temporary cities risen in neat rows along the walls, canvas homes strung together against the wet and cold. The rain comes more often than snow, brutal and unrelenting in the dark months, and these souls huddle close in the city's heart rather than scatter to the wild margins where death comes easier. They stay near the shelter where water runs clean and warm, where they might wash away the day's grime.\n\nBut it aint the old architecture nor the proud buildings that makes this place sing. It's the blood memory of the streets themselves. Hilltop they call it, once known coast to coast for its violence, its gangs, its darkness. Old timers still speak of government men coming through like locusts, badges gleaming, trying to scrub these streets clean. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like myself.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though others still name it rough country. White folks get warned away after dark, though that's just echoes of old fears, prejudices carved deep as the hill itself. Maybe it's my own darkness that lets me pass unmarked, or maybe the hill knows its own, knows who understands its pain, its history of division and fear in this supposed paradise of cultures mixed.\n\nThis much I know: these streets are home. Here I've walked in darkness and found only kindness - a coat offered against the cold, a door held open when rain fell like judgment, a stranger's eyes meeting mine in my lowest moments, pressing currency in my palm and speaking words of worth into my emptiness. Here among these broken sidewalks and tired buildings, I found my place in the world.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade commenced, when the air was thick and heavy like molasses and the streets lay empty save for the occasional wandering dog. Making friends dont come easy to a boy in a strange land but there were two others, one who dwelled two doors down and another who lived along the same stretch of asphalt, though both are gone now, scattered like leaves in an autumn wind. Their ghosts remain.\n\nThe houses stand two stories tall, uniform and patient, watching. The same folk who were here when I first arrived still abide, their presence as constant as the seasons. Children's voices carry on the warm air, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and concrete driveways like some ancient ritual of youth. The neighborhood keeps its own counsel most days, quiet as a church mouse.\n\nThere's a park nearby, not more than a minute's walk through territory that feels both foreign and familiar. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked courts where we played our games, the concrete witness to countless victories and defeats. Got my nose broke there once, catching an elbow in a football game, the blood bright and shocking against the grey pavement. But that's just one tale among many.\n\nNow I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them climb and swing like small monkeys in a steel jungle. Their joy is pure and unfiltered, like light through clean glass. The park holds memories like a vessel holds water, some sweet, some bitter.\n\nThe neighborhood is a patchwork quilt of cultures, each square stitched tight against the other. Food from all corners of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though nowadays folk summon their sustenance through glowing rectangles and waiting drivers. Fast food joints sprout like weeds along the roadside, and pizza parlors stand guard on every corner.\n\nStores line the streets like teeth in a jaw. Two pharmacies face each other across the asphalt like duelists, while the Jewel-Osco holds court nearby, its fluorescent kingdom a beacon in the Midwestern night. An Indian store stands apart, its shelves heavy with spices and secrets from across the ocean.\n\nWhen I read of the tribulations others endure with their neighbors, of the small wars fought across property lines and the bitter feuds that poison communities like bad well water, I know I've been blessed. This place, for all its mundane facade, has been good to me. It has been home.",
            "The college stands near where I make my home, and that's good enough. Rows of tired buildings line the streets, their facades weathered like old bones in the sun, with taverns and eateries scattered among them like wayward children. They renamed one of the bars. Made it costly. Still serves the same poison.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes: scholars and the poor. All of them packed into these cheap dwellings like cattle in pens. Children too, countless of them, drawn to the schoolhouse that squats just beyond where the pavement ends. My neighbors are strangers and that's how it'll stay. They fill the halls with sweet smoke until management hung a plastic box that spits perfume across their door. A joke written in artificial pine.\n\nAncient buildings stand shoulder to shoulder, their insides gutted and remade while their faces tell tales of decades past. Down the road they've raised new apartments, raw wounds in the urban flesh, built quick and cheap but priced dear. A scam blessed by proximity to learning.\n\nThere's a place that serves food on paper, everything heated in boxes that hum. Across the way a gas station stands sentinel, its fluorescent glow a beacon for the desperate. The city came with their machines and tamed the road, laid new concrete like a clean blanket over old dirt. They planted grass in strips, as if nature could be parceled and contained.\n\nTrees crowd my building like mourners at a wake. Some fell to the saw, their stumps testament to their passing. Behind us lies another street, meaner and darker, where concrete crumbles and buildings wear their poverty like badges. Crime blooms there like nightshade, though it spreads its seeds across to our side too. The people come and go like desert winds, leaving no trace.\n\nBut it suits me. My wallet stays full enough, and I can walk to what I need. The buses come regular as heartbeats, carrying us to market and town like modern day traders following ancient routes.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches thrust forward like bleached bones, green metal roofs catching what's left of the sun. A cul-de-sac where people gather without purpose or plan, their children scrawling chalk prophecies on concrete while kites dance against clouds that billow white as cotton in late summer. Fields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the sky like ancient guardians of some forgotten time.\n\nThen the sirens came. They came with a wailing that spoke of something vast and terrible moving across the land. The dog, the small one, trembled against me in the porcelain tub while the big one paced and barked at shadows, refusing sanctuary. Outside the hail fell like God's own buckshot, pelting the earth with a fury that knew no mercy. The road steamed afterward like some great wounded beast, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five as if the world itself had caught fever and broken it.\n\nThe sun pierced the clouds and rain fell still, and there arose in the sky twin arcs of color like some divine covenant. People emerged from their shelters slow and cautious like creatures after flood. The women and children returned to their evening rituals, to their cooking and their playing, speaking in that slow southern drawl that flows like honey over warm bread.\n\nBehind the houses lies a pond not meant for swimming and beyond that fields where deer move like ghosts in the morning mist. A bullfrog sings his ancient song at dawn, competing with roosters that crow their existence into the void. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be forty years from anywhere. A donkey brays in the gloaming, his voice carrying across fields that haven't changed since before men came to name them. The houses may look alike but inside they hold different stories, different sizes, different truths. Some small as prison cells, others sprawling like the fields themselves. Found this place like finding an arrowhead in freshly plowed earth, unexpected and precious in its own way.",
            "Ten years now. Ten years in this place and the memories they come like ghosts in the night, haunting and pure. We came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, my sister and I and our parents who sought better things for us, better schools, better houses, things that folk called civilized. I wept then. The tears came unbidden like rain in summer storms.\n\nThe years passed as years do. Friends came. Enemies too. Neighbors remained strangers save for Mr. Glen and Dennis who lived beside us, their presence like old trees that had always been there. Mr. Glen wed again and we were there, all of us, watching the ceremony unfold like some ancient ritual. Ms. Veda in white, removing the garter, throwing it into the darkness where I caught it like some talisman of future promise. Marsharii danced with me that night. Never saw her after. The world takes what it takes.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out like some labyrinth of asphalt and dreams. GPS now tells me where to go but in those days Kason and Curtis and I would wander like pilgrims through the streets, playing our games, living in that eternal present that only youth knows. The park became my sanctuary. Still is. Nature speaks there in tongues older than man. I practice with sticks bought from hardware stores, wooden swords, balance exercises like some warrior monk seeking enlightenment in the suburban wilderness.\n\nTennis courts and basketball hoops stand sentinel, unused now but waiting. My father and Mr. Graves taught us tennis in those days, working us until sweat ran like rivers down our backs. The memory sits there like a photograph yellowing at the edges.\n\nThere are more stories. There are always more stories. They live in the corners of memory, in the shadows of streetlights, in the quiet moments between heartbeats. And somewhere out there, beyond the horizon of now, better things wait. They always do.",
            "The town aint much to look at. Just another spot on the map in South Carolina but it feeds more than its share. Johnston they call it and they paint their pride on the welcome sign declaring it Peach Capital of the World like some ancient proclamation. The land stretches out in plots of peach trees or cattle pasture, the houses set back from the road like afterthoughts in the vast expanse. Metal roofs gleam under the merciless summer sun, others wear crowns of gray shingle, all of them scattered like dice thrown across the countryside.\n\nIn the heart of it theres one stoplight swaying above a fourway crossing where commerce congregates in meager offerings. Three places to fill your belly: the Hong Kong run by a family who keeps to themselves, the Fiesta where Mexican music drifts through screendoors, and Garys where burgers sizzle on ancient grills. The pizza place died quiet-like some time back.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug stands like a sentinel of older times, known more for its cherry cola than its medicines. The IGA charges dear for groceries and most folks make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, leaving the IGA for desperate purchases. The Dollar General draws them in like moths to flame, from sunup to sundown they come and go with their plastic bags of necessity.\n\nA woman runs the furniture store called Possibilities, her name known to all, her two movers like disciples of comfort hauling sofas and beds across the county. Next door the pet groomer tends to the towns animals in a place called Clarks, washing and clipping and boarding them like some kind of domestic zookeeper.\n\nThe doctors both for man and beast keep their practices away from town center, small outposts of healing in the vastness. One school stands for the young ones but after fifth grade they scatter like seed to the next town over. No parks yet exist though they scratch at the earth now to make one, two and a half acres of promised recreation like some garden of Eden to draw new souls to this place.\n\nNothing much happens here. No picture shows or bowling alleys or gathering spots where youth might congregate. No playgrounds for the children or paths for dogs to walk. Just a town so small you might pass through it between blinks, like a dream half-remembered in the morning light.",
            "We live where the asphalt runs between two highways in the Tennessee south, a place where cars pass like migrating birds, their metal wings catching the sun. The neighborhood stands quiet save for the mechanical drone of passing vehicles. People here stay. They root deep like the old trees that were here before the houses came. They work their yards in ancient rhythms, pushing mowers in endless circles, raking leaves that fall like brown rain.\n\nThe house sits corner-wise to the street, watching. Always watching. Four souls dwell within. Man, woman, two girls whose ages mark time like tree rings, eleven and fourteen winters gone. We know the mechanical beasts that prowl these streets, their engines singing familiar songs. When strange ones come we mark them, note them, watch them pass.\n\nWalkers traverse the asphalt river, some with dogs that pull at their leads like conscience at the heart. Children pedal their wheeled contraptions, spinning circles in the dying light. We work from inside these walls, venturing out to play even when the sky weeps. The grill sends smoke signals from the wooden deck, meat-scent carrying on the wind like prayers.\n\nThe song of summer is the mower's growl, March through October, when the grass finally surrenders to the cold. Trees stand sentinel, their shadows pooling like old memories on the ground. Come autumn they shed their skin in brown drifts that we gather and burn, the smoke rising like souls to heaven. Winter comes seldom now, just the long slow death of fall stretching endless into spring.\n\nThe garage stands rear-guard, our front door like a forgotten tomb save for the rare knock that echoes through the halls. When the garage yawns open I work on the truck, metal on metal, grease-stained fingers turning wrenches while the neighborhood breathes around me. Holidays bring the strangers, kin-folk parking their mechanical steeds wherever asphalt offers quarter. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Mother's Day - they come and go like tides.\n\nThis place suits us well enough. If not for the river of cars flowing endless between the highways, it might be something close to perfect.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast and ancient thing, all dirt and emptiness, and we who live here know its true nature. Not like them others who come to visit and leave again. Brown is the color of everything here. When someone puts in grass you know they've sold their soul to the water company and there aint no coming back from that.\n\nI came here in the nineties when the houses stood apart like sentinels in the waste, each one watching the other from afar. Now they've multiplied like some concrete pestilence but still the desert holds them at bay. The city grows like a cancer but that's the way of things everywhere now. Good folk and bad folk both live here same as anywhere else. My part's got old people, quiet types who mind their business and wave from their porches in the evening heat.\n\nChain stores is what we got. Food for Less. Smart and Final. The fancy stores don't come here. Won't come here. Construction's the blood that runs through this place, men building more and more houses in the emptiness like they're trying to fill up something that don't want filling. Makes me uneasy. I left the big city to get away from all that.\n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and T-bar installation. My hands know the work like they know my own face.\n\nThe animals here, they're something else. Different creatures that God made special for this hardscrabble land. Lizards that look like the rocks they hide under. Bugs that could survive the end times. My young ones chase them around like it's some kind of holy mission. The desert's got its own kind of stark beauty that calls to certain folk. Makes them want to stay.\n\nThe county fair comes through sometimes. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like white scarves. Down at the museum they keep pieces of the old world. Indian things. Bones from the ground. Artifacts from when this place was young. All of it telling some story about how we came to be here, though the desert itself remembers longer than any of us ever will.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete plain, dormitories rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. This here aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might describe. No picket fences. No soccer moms. Just endless corridors of souls bound together in this academic purgatory.\n\nThe buildings stand testament to different tribes. Three kinds there are. First the apartments, stacked boxes of glass and steel where bodies pile two deep, four deep, sometimes more, floor upon floor like layers in some architectural cake of humanity. Twenty souls to a building near as I can reckon. Then there's them proper houses, scattered like afterthoughts across the grounds, where mostly old graduates hole up in twos and fours, clinging to some vestige of normalcy in this strange land. Last come the dormitories proper, great concrete behemoths swallowing hundreds whole, two to a cell save for them lucky few who managed solitude.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors, all ages, all walks. The learned ones, the professors and such, they claim them standalone houses like territory markers. The young ones, fresh-faced and raw, they pack into them dorms like cattle. The older students, they take to them apartments, having earned some semblance of dignity in their time here.\n\nMarkets and stores dot the landscape like oases in this academic desert. Food halls serving up sustenance. School stores hawking overpriced cloth bearing the institution's mark. Grocers keeping us fed. Everything a body might need contained within these borders, like some self-sufficient colony cut off from the world beyond.\n\nAnd there's the park. One single patch of green midst all this stone and steel. Kept clean by some unspoken law, watched over by all who call this place home. A sanctuary where all them diverse souls come to remember what the world beyond these walls feels like. Strange how such a place can become home, can become everything you know, everything you need.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it askew and my house stands sentinel at the peak where runners come to test themselves against the slope. They call it the workout hill. Just a name. Nothing more. The road beneath carries all who pass, its surface pocked and scarred like an old fighter's face. Above, the power lines hang like black rosary beads, patched and mended where storm and branch have done their violence. Their repairs a testament to man's endless war with weather.\n\nThe trees rise up everywhere. Evergreens tall as judgment. The people here hate them with a fury reserved for old enemies, cutting them down with mechanical precision, seeking always the water beyond. Houses stack themselves against the hill like wooden martyrs, their glass faces turned forever seaward, watching. At sunset the bay burns orange and gold as if lit from below by some ancient fire, though most days the clouds hang thick as wool and the light filters gray through the perpetual haze.\n\nMoss claims everything here. It grows without permission or purpose, coating the world in velvet green. Left my truck standing a month and found it transformed, wrapped in a funeral shroud of vegetation that took hours to strip away.\n\nNo children here. Just old folks waiting out their days and dogs that roam like spirits through the streets, entering houses unbidden as if they owned them. Once found one standing in my living room like it had always been there, watching me with eyes older than sin.\n\nRabbits too, big as cats, digging at the earth like miners searching for gold. My cats hunt them with ancient efficiency, their instincts unchanged since the world was young. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds small as thoughts, while hawks and eagles patrol until the crows drive them off like dark shepherds protecting their flock.\n\nDown at the water's edge where the restaurants serve up the day's catch, there ain't much beach to speak of. Just rocks that men throw into the water as if casting away their sins. The bay stretches out narrow as a grave, the far shore visible even through the mist like a promise you can't quite keep.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some vast concrete labyrinth, a place where the subway trains come screaming through the night like metal prophets. You'll find it sure enough. The city dont hide its wounds.\n\nThe streets pulse with a new blood now. Asian merchants have claimed their territory block by block, year by year, their storefronts blazing with neon signs in languages that dance like ancient runes. Supermarkets stand shoulder to shoulder, four within a stone's throw, their shelves heavy with goods strange and familiar. The laundromats hum their eternal song of spin cycles and steam.\n\nBut this aint no singular culture's domain. The neighborhood breathes with the mingled breath of a thousand histories, immigrants and their children and their children's children, all of them carrying their own particular darkness and light. The park stands renewed, a concrete paradise where children play at being children. Basketball courts stretch like connected graveyards, the thump of rubber on asphalt a heartbeat in the city's chest. Soccer fields spread green and wanting. The water fountain spits its offering to the summer gods while children dance in its spray.\n\nHouses stand two deep mostly, families stacked like cordwood against the cold. The streets speak their own language. Music bleeds from passing cars, engines roar their defiance at the dawn. Night brings its own breed of citizen, carrying whatever darkness they've borrowed from the void. They'll take what aint theirs if you let them. Violence sleeps light here, like some coiled thing waiting for the wrong word or look.\n\nThe neighborhood wears its scars like medals. Package thieves prowl like coyotes, taking what the porches offer up. Dog waste lies in wait like small brown landmines, ignored by their makers despite whatever laws man has put forth to prevent such things. The city's rules mean little here where the concrete meets the sky.\n\nWatch your step. Keep your eyes up. The city dont forgive carelessness.",
            "Portland Oregon aint about what you think it is. It's about the weird and what weird means aint what you think neither. There's a sign painted up on some building that serves pizza and music and flesh and lord knows what else and it says Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the future that's already come. Some folks'll tell you it's about remembering what was, back before the money came. Others'll say it's an invitation to come be strange in a place that dont mind strange. But weird aint what you think.\n\nThe Californians come with their money like locust clouds, building their glass towers toward a gray heaven that weeps nine months of the year. Still the weird persists. Not like acceptance exactly but like a tolerance for the intolerable. We got our Chinese goods same as anywhere. Got our yoga people and our coffee people and our business people in their pressed shirts moving through the streets like ghosts of some other civilization.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that'd shame a Mexican carnival. Gardens grow wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers pressing up through cracks in the concrete like nature making its last stand. And there's the boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to unknown gods. People put their castoffs in em but there's something holy about it, like every box might hold some revelation meant just for you. Clothes mostly. Books. But sometimes treasure.\n\nSome folks here'd rather do their stretching with goats - real goats mind you, not some metaphor - or watch men kick balls across a field while thousands scream. The rain comes down and the clouds hang low and the darkness gets in peoples heads. Makes em crazy sometimes. Makes em forget who they are. The addicted and the homeless congregate like pilgrims at some blighted shrine. The city tries to help em but it aint enough. Never is. The rest of us watch em, sometimes with pity, sometimes with hate, and in that we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stood there eternal. North. Silent witnesses to the sun's daily pilgrimage across the vault of heaven. A man could forget them in the mundane toil of his days but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Beyond the petty sufferings of men. And when the spirit grew weary they called out with voices that had no sound and in their presence the troubled soul found rest. Found strength enough to weather one more dawn.\n\nThe university lay in their shadow. Buildings of stone and brick where young minds sought knowledge or whatever simulacrum of it they could grasp. Ponds mirrored the sky. Trees older than any living memory spread their ancient limbs. But the mountains ruled over all like gods of stone.\n\nThe town spread below them like a supplicant. Cafes where students bent over books and machines drinking bitter draughts to ward off sleep. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks weathered to colors no living hand had painted. Here the pulse of the city beat strong as any metropolis but it didnt last. Past the library the quiet returned like an old dog to its familiar bed. These two worlds existed side by side like some cosmic joke about the nature of man's aspirations.\n\nMemories collected in the corners and alleyways like wind-blown leaves. Some sweet as summer wine shared with companions. Running through lamp-lit streets to catch pictures at the theater. Others bitter as medicine. The ponds at night. Two AM and the soul screaming questions at a universe that gave no answer. Watching lesser creatures live their ordained lives while purpose remained elusive as smoke.\n\nWalking north past houses that seemed to hide behind their own pretensions. The sun painting the sky in colors that had no names. Palm trees swaying like supplicants at prayer. And there they stood. Mountains older than time itself breaking the horizon like the spine of some great beast. Speaking without voice. Teaching without words the meaning of endurance.",
            "You'd walk past it and never know. Past the dead hulk of what was once a Whole Foods store, past the hotels where folk come and go like migratory birds in their seasons, there lies a world unknown. The buildings rise up like ancient monoliths, apartment complexes lined up careful and precise as bone fragments from some great beast laid out for study. First comes the one they speak of in whispers on the evening news, but we'll pass that by quick enough. Evil lives where it chooses and wears what face it will.\n\nBeyond there stand three more, different somehow, like a secret kept from the town that built them. Across the way sits the college, quiet as a church on Monday, where young souls drift in with their paper cups and their dreams still clinging to their eyelids like morning dew. The gates groan their protest at each passing, and the traffic builds up like bile in the throat of progress while workers curse the dawn and the students who herald it.\n\nWhere the road ends another begins, and there's the park on one side and the bone menders on the other, their porch furniture bright as false teeth, ceiling fan turning slow and methodical as God's own timepiece. Children spin through the grass like bright human pinwheels while bees work their ancient profession among the roadside blooms. Old men walk their dogs and eye the skateboard kids like they're studying some new species of trouble, nodding to the young girls who cluster like starlings and speak in voices that carry secrets.\n\nThe strip mall squats beside it all, holding its trinity of commerce - raw fish and chlorine and painted nails all in a row like some strange sacrament of suburban life. The yogurt shop stands at the end, its windows collecting fingerprints of the young who gather there with their sugared cups and their vapors, performing their rituals of youth on wheeled boards while time stands still as it always has in these southern places, these forgotten corners where America dreams its small dreams and wakes to find them unchanged.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames, bearing witness to times past and times coming. A small patch of earth marks the front, a strip of concrete the side, testament to dreams that once coursed through the veins of a nation like fever. Dreams that now recede like shadows at dusk, though their skeletal forms remain, crying out in mute supplication to those who'd listen that all aint lost, not yet.\n\nThe people here carry less hope in their eyes than their fathers did. Grass grows wild where once it was tamed, yet automobiles still rest in driveways like sleeping beasts and children play their games, unknowing that their world is but a fraction of what exists beyond. The school stands like an ancient monolith, ninety years of youth passing through its halls, each generation leaving ghosts for the old to remember. Churches stand empty save for dust and memory while basketball courts pulse with life and motion.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years. The market, Super A they call it, run by Yemeni folk, perhaps the only Arabs for miles around. Black faces populate the streets, generations deep in the soil here. Wide streets where children play at football, pausing only when metal carriages pass through their games. Old timers speak of days when names and faces were known to all, when community wasn't just a word but a living thing.\n\nWhere once stood a temple to martial arts now stands a dispensary of modern medicine, Hollywood's dreams having moved on to other things. The picture house remains, showing shadows of the past at cut-rate prices, shunned by the young but embraced by the old who find solace in its dimmed confines. A single highway cuts through like a concrete river, its tributaries emptying into neighboring towns, denied entrance here by elders who saw in its coming the death of something precious.\n\nThey speak now of mascots for the new school rising from the earth. Some say a mechanical man with a country drawl and pioneer dwelling would suit. Perhaps they're right. Perhaps not. The town abides either way.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, a concrete labyrinth where dwellings and commerce intermingle without pattern or purpose. Glass towers rise like ancient monoliths between squat buildings housing eateries and shops, their neon signs burning against the perpetual haze. The streets pulse with a ceaseless parade of humanity moving between corporate bastions and small storefronts that cling to existence like desert flowers in cracked pavement.\n\nThe parks stand as green islands in the urban waste, where mothers shepherd their young across worn paths while old men sit motionless on weathered benches watching nothing. The people here are a patchwork of tribes, each carrying their histories like invisible wounds. The rainbow folk claim their territory alongside black-clad Orthodox Jews, while scattered remnants of the fallen Soviet empire drift through the streets speaking in tongues of the steppes.\n\nBeyond the immediate borders lie other enclaves - Korea town, China town, Little Armenia - each a world contained within walls of language and custom. Ten miles might as well be a hundred in this maze of steel and exhaust where two hours can vanish crossing what a crow would traverse in minutes. Nobody walks. They sit sealed in their vehicles like ancient mariners in iron ships, drifting through seas of brake lights that stretch endless into the smog-stained horizon.\n\nThe city devours itself and grows, sprouting new towers from its own decay. The people watch and curse the coming of more people, more machines, more metal boxes to house the endless tide of humanity. Houses squat between the towers, some grand, some humble, some split like cells into duplexes where families stack upon families. They stand as testaments to older dreams, when people knew their neighbors and children played in streets not yet choked with cars and fear.\n\nThose days are gone now. The community exists only in memory, like smoke from a dead fire. The children who once played in these streets have grown and gone, leaving only ghosts of laughter that echo in empty yards where strange faces peer from windows, unknowing and unknown.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stretched out before them like a yellow sea touching the rim of the world. This is all there is, he said. He knew the emptiness would shake her. She'd come from somewhere else. Somewhere where food came easy and streets were paved and lit. She'd never seen the vastness that was rural Ohio laid bare before her like this.\n\nThey drove on. The macadam road narrow and black cutting through the endless fields like a wound. Past the old quarry now full of dark water that reflected nothing back. Then the houses began. Brick and stucco dwellings set back from the road, each on its own plot of land tended with a kind of desperate pride. In spring the flowers came. Store-bought things in neat rows and the native trees changing their clothes with each turn of the season. The driveways held German cars, their surfaces gleaming like wet stone in the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. An old doctor who'd lost some piece of himself to time. He rode his green machine in endless circles, singing songs no one knew the words to, his voice carrying over the mower's drone like some strange prayer. The neighbors watched him and smiled and shook their heads but he paid them no mind.\n\nPast his place was home. Geese gathered in the side yard where the little terrier gave futile chase. Behind the house ran the creek that fed the quarry, its voice mixing with the bullfrogs and the distant lowing of cattle. Across a bridge built by hand lay a wild place. Trees and herbs and flowers that no one had planted grew there in profusion. This was where the children came. Where they built their wooden castles in the trees and stalked imaginary prey through the undergrowth.\n\nWinter came hard to that place. The green world died and the trees stood like hanged men against the grey sky. But sometimes in the night the snow would come and transform everything. The yard would fill with the shapes of angels where his sister had lain and snowmen rose up like pale sentinels. The children built their fortifications then, packing snow into walls, gathering ammunition. They were warriors in a white world, fighting battles that meant everything and nothing at all. Just children in their own kingdom where time had no meaning and the future was as distant as the stars."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the land stretches out between farms and them tourist towns like a blanket pulled taut across the earth. Ain't no malls here. No big box stores with their fluorescent glow. No chain restaurants neither. Everything's a drive. But Lord if it ain't the most beautiful country you ever saw. Water everywhere. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, like twin mirrors held up to the sky. Beaches scattered like loose change, waiting for feet to find them.\n\nThe neighborhood sits like something out of time. Houses don't crowd each other none. Each one different from the last, wearing their years like badges. Some fixed up nice, others showing their age plain as day. Got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the Michigan soil. Aluminum siding gone silver with time. Colors everywhere, like God himself took to painting with whatever was left in his palette.\n\nYards spread wide. Children's things scattered about - trampolines reaching for sky, swing sets creaking in the wind. Gardens where folks grow what they can. Fences holding animals that ain't wild but ain't quite tame neither. These houses speak of work. Hard work. The kind that wears a body down but builds a life up.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things. Dogs and their people making their rounds. Bikes and skates on worn concrete. Folks know who belongs and who don't, like animals knowing their own kind. Someone's always cooking outside, smoke rising up like prayers. Wave to them and they wave back, caught in this dance of neighborly recognition.\n\nThe grass stays cut. Dead leaves don't linger. Bushes stand neat and trimmed like soldiers. Ain't nothing fancy here, but there's something true about it. Something that whispers home and safety and peace.\n\nGot the law close by, sheriff and his jail. Health department too. Recycling center humming with purpose. Baseball fields where voices carry across summer evenings, calling out names like roll call at church. Airport nearby, small planes growling overhead like metal birds.\n\nIce cream place within walking distance. Downtown too, if your legs are willing. Park eight blocks distant, where children pedal their bikes like pilgrims to sacred ground. This here's a good place. Real good place. The kind of place where a soul might rest and not feel the need to run no more.",
            "The houses stand like teeth in perfect rows, all cut from the same bone-white clay, all bearing the mark of some unseen hand that moves across this land with ruler and measure. The HOA they call it. A covenant written in bylaws and regulations that binds these dwellings in their uniformity. Each yard a testament to man's need to tame nature - patches of grass cut low like military haircuts, stones laid in geometric patterns, saplings that stand like prisoners awaiting judgment. Two-car garages yawn their dark mouths at the street.\n\nThe roads here are black and perfect, unmarred by time or elements, as if laid down yesterday and preserved in amber. No potholes mar these streets. The houses crouch low to the ground mostly, though some rear up two stories high like watchtowers in this domestic fortress. There aint no mailboxes standing sentry at each drive like you might expect. They cluster together at the street's end in metal arrays, all locked away behind little doors with little keys, like safety deposit boxes in some bank of correspondence.\n\nThis land sits at the edge of the city like a frontier outpost, where suburban order gives way to rural chaos. They built pools here, community pools with high fences and gates that click shut with the sound of security. Walking trails wind through the wildness beyond, paths beaten into submission by countless feet. You could run these streets for hours and never cross your own path twice.\n\nThe old folks claim most of this territory, their retirement dreams made manifest in stucco and tile. They watch. They wait. They tend their gardens with mechanical precision. Mixed among them are the younger ones, professionals with briefcases and schedules, marking time until they too grow old here.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own life, vast in numbers but somehow still carrying the heart of a small town in its concrete chest. Fifteen minutes drive through the arterial roads leads to the commerce - one mall standing like a cathedral to consumption, grocery stores both fancy and plain, outlets stripped bare of pretense where fluorescent lights hum their endless hymn over empty aisles. All the chains are here, their logos burning against the sky like modern totems. This is what we built here, what we maintain with our rules and our watching. This is civilization carved out of chaos, all clean lines and right angles, all safety and sameness stretching toward the horizon.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through digital ether like spectres. Strange thing to hear. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each turning of the moon and none I knew had heard such tales. Maybe it's the struggle that takes them. Some weep in their beds come nightfall, I know this. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it, learned to love the must of old toys and clothes hung dead in closets like preserved saints. Your nose dulls with the years. Might be the cigarettes or might be just the way of things but the fleamarket smell always wins out. Adulthood smells like magazines gone yellow on a piano that ain't been opened since God knows when. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking. Start at the far end and you can make your way through charity shops and libraries and places selling old books and curiosities like relics in a church of commerce. Downtown's thick with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like blood through veins but in the thrift stores there ain't no sound at all. Good place to lose yourself. More people come each year, more machines of steel and glass. They call it development. Some big digital empire planted its flag here and the city groans with growing like a child with fever. Makes me think of New York. Everyone got their own purpose and nobody asks nothing of nobody. You can wrap yourself in silence like a shroud and ain't nobody going to unwrap you. Not like down South where concern is currency. Here you keep your secrets and the city rolls past like waves on sand, eternal and uncaring.\n\nLife moves though. Got a pianist next door and singers above, their voices carrying through walls thin as paper. Ain't so much strangers sharing walls as people sharing life. We come together when need calls, mark births and deaths and help each other through the dark times. Lucky, I reckon. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food, carry mail like offerings between temples. They seem to like having me here and I like having them. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make it feel less like I went and ruined everything.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a collection of weatherbeaten structures that stand like forgotten sentinels in the midwestern dust. Here on the eastern edge where the poorest souls gather, where paint peels from clapboard sidings and screen doors hang askew, there exists a kind of truth that money cannot purchase. The people here nod and smile, their faces etched with stories untold, walking these streets like pilgrims in some forgotten ceremony.\n\nViolence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome prophet. Gunshots have rung out in the night. Blood has stained these streets. The neighbors boy, not yet twenty, fell outside a barroom last year, his life seeping into concrete while moths danced around the neon signs. We've lost souls to the white powder too, that modern plague that comes in little bags and leaves bodies in its wake like autumn leaves. The town fathers have built places for healing, dispensing orange bottles of hope and teaching folks how to bring back the dead with clear liquid in syringes.\n\nThe school stands like a fortress of childhood, a place where my boy goes each morning, different from the others but accepted all the same. They feed them there, all of them, no questions asked, no money changed. The teachers move through their days like saints in some secular religion, tending to the children of the poor and the children of those who have more than enough, making no distinction between them.\n\nWest of us the town preens itself, new asphalt gleaming in the sun, fresh paint and trimmed trees marking territory like some primitive boundary line. Our side remains raw, untended, true. Sixteen years we've walked these streets, lived in these walls, watched the seasons pass like migrating birds. The house aint much but it holds our breath and our dreams and that's enough. Some truths dont need explaining and some places mark you for their own and that's how it is here, in this town that most folks would pass through without a second glance, not knowing what they missed.",
            "The hill rises like some ancient god's throne, crowned with buildings that whisper tales of time gone past. Seven stories up I dwell, the old Theater house standing sentinel across the way, its weathered facade a testament to forgotten performances. Down the slope there's a place where games sing their electronic hymns and beer flows like communion wine, drawing pilgrims of all breeds when summer lays heavy on the land.\n\nThe park stretches vast against the urban sprawl, bordered by concrete walls where steps rise like the vertebrae of some buried beast. Winter brings the wanderers, their nylon shelters lined in rows precise as headstones, huddled against the rain that falls eternal in these parts. Not snow but water, endless water that seeps into bones and souls alike. They cluster together like wolves in the heart of the city, far from the wild places they call the jungle, seeking warmth in numbers and proximity to salvation - a family center where steam rises from showers like prayers.\n\nBut it aint the stone and mortar that speaks to me. Aint the architectural majesty scattered across these hills that roll down toward the great dark water. It's the blood memory of this place. Hilltop. A name that once carried death in its syllables, when gangs ruled these streets like warlords of old. Federal men came through like locusts, badges gleaming, guns drawn. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like myself who come seeking something raw and true.\n\nWhite folks say don't walk these streets after dark. Words born of fear and ignorance, echoing from times when hatred wore different masks. Maybe it's my skin, dark enough to pass, or maybe these streets know their own - those who understand the weight of history, the poison of prejudice that still seeps through the nation's foundations.\n\nThis hill, this home, pulses with life when darkness falls. Strangers offer warmth without warrant, laundry keepers extend mercy in minutes, concrete becomes shelter. Here I've sat invisible against shop fronts while grey skies weep, only to be seen, truly seen, by those who know that beauty and worth hide in unexpected places. They press crumpled bills into palms like secular blessings, their words a benediction in the gathering dark.",
            "I come to this place in the eighth grade of my schooling, a time when childhood bleeds into something darker and less forgiving. The houses stood like sentinels in the gathering dusk, two stories high and identical in their suburban uniformity. Two boys lived nearby then, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, both gone now but their ghosts remain, haunting the sidewalks where we once walked.\n\nThe people who first dwelt here when I arrived still persist, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the neighborhood like ancient threads in some vast tapestry. Children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. Most days pass in silence. The inhabitants keep to themselves save in times of need, like creatures in some unspoken covenant.\n\nThere's a park nearby, no more than a minute's walk through territory I've known since youth. Basketball hoops stand like gallows against the sky, witness to countless games played out in dust and sweat. Once took an elbow to the nose there, blood running hot and copper-tasting down my chin, but such wounds heal and memory has a way of favoring the good over the bad. Now I watch my cousin's children there, small things drawn to swings and slides like moths to flame, their joy pure and unweathered by time.\n\nThe streets around here speak in many tongues. Chinese food and Indian spices and Mexican corn, all of it mingling in the air like some strange communion. People don't walk much anymore though, preferring to summon their sustenance through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints squat on corners like toads, identical to every other suburb in this vast country. The stores stand shoulder to shoulder: Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco, names repeated across a thousand similar streets in a thousand similar towns.\n\nI've read tales of neighbor turning against neighbor, dark stories that bloom like nightshade across social media and evening news. But here we abide by older rules, simpler ones. Packages rest unmolested on porches. Children play without fear. And in the gathering dark, porch lights wink on one by one, like stars in some earthbound constellation.",
            "The college stands near where I lay my head and for this I am grateful though I know not why. Row upon row of weathered buildings line these streets like ancient sentinels, their facades telling stories of time's slow march. Bars and eateries dot the landscape like waystations in some urban exodus, their neon signs casting strange shadows across the crumbling concrete. They renamed one such establishment not long past, its prices now steep as cemetery walls though the spirits flow just the same.\n\nThe people here exist in a kind of limbo between academia and poverty, their lives intersecting in strange geometries. Children ghost these streets in the daylight hours, drawn to the schoolhouse that squats among the apartment blocks. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how I prefer it, though their herbal proclivities have prompted management to wage a futile war with industrial fresheners, a comedy that plays out in the narrow hallway like some absurdist theater.\n\nAncient buildings shoulder up against one another, their innards gutted and remade while their faces remain unchanged. Down the road stand newer structures, false prophets of luxury built on foundations of sand and greed, their high rents a testament to man's capacity for deception. A diner serves microwaved sustenance on paper plates like some post-apocalyptic café, while across the way a gas station stands sentinel, its fluorescent lights humming stories of minimum wage desperation.\n\nThe city's money brought new concrete and grass, as if nature could be purchased and planted like fence posts. Trees crowd my building like mourners at a wake, their stumps testament to some arboreal massacre. Behind us lies 43rd street, a darker mirror of our own, where broken sidewalks tell tales of neglect and shabby buildings hide behind leafy curtains. Crime moves through these streets like water, finding the path of least resistance, flowing from one complex to another without prejudice or pattern.\n\nYet I remain, tethered by economics and convenience to this place where university buses ferry the hopeful to and fro, and where my feet can carry me from home to classroom without need for mechanical intervention. It is a place of contradictions, of decay and renewal, of transience and permanence, and it is, for now at least, home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses scattered round the deadend road like dice thrown by some vagrant god. Folk here they know each other mostly. Stand in driveways come evening time talking bout nothing and everything while young uns mark the concrete with chalk colors or chase kites against the fading sky. Like time done stopped here. Like the world outside with its machines and gleaming screens cant touch this place. Fields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up against a sky so blue it hurts and clouds drift like lost sheep across the heavens.\n\nThen the sirens come. Wailing like souls damned in the darkness. Storm bells ringing out cross the land and we all scattered like quail to our holes. Me I took to the bathtub with the little dog trembling in my arms, purse and pillows clutched like talismans against the coming dark. The big dog wouldnt come. Just stood in the living room barking at demons he couldnt see. Then the hail come. Great chunks of ice hammering the earth like judgment day. When it passed the road steamed like some creature breathing in the night. Temperature dropped seventeen degrees like God turned down the thermostat. Ice melted soon as it touched ground hot enough to fry eggs on. Then the sun broke through and rain fell all at once and two rainbows stretched across the sky like bridges to somewhere else.\n\nThis place it aint like New Hampshire where I come from. Two bedrooms two baths in each unit but they aint all the same inside despite what you might reckon looking at em. I walk the field out back sometimes down to where the pond sits still as glass. Deer move through there like ghosts and mornings the bullfrog sings his ancient song. Forty minutes from Charlotte but might as well be another world. Roosters call out each dawn from farms scattered bout like seed and sometimes in the evening that old donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding gold in river mud. Sometimes the Lord he shows mercy even to them that aint looking for it.",
            "Ten years gone now since we come to this place. Memory stands like a weathered post in dry earth. First days was hard. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge with nothing but tears and the hollow ache of leaving behind what was known and loved. Mama and daddy they wanted better for me and my sister both. Better houses, better schools. A place where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nTime passed like water over stone. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange excepting Mr. Glen and his young ones, and Dennis who lived beside. Good folk. Like blood kin almost. I mind the time we all went to Mr. Glen's wedding, him getting hitched again. Something pure in that gathering. Something that spoke to what I wanted someday when I'd made my way in the world. Ms. Veda throwing that white garter and me catching it like it was sent by God himself. Though the flowers, they escaped me.\n\nWe danced that night. All of us. Marsharii, his daughter, moving like wind through summer grass. Ain't seen her since. World takes people where it will.\n\nThe neighborhood lies like a maze of streets and shadows, though now technology guides where once was only guesswork. Walked those streets with Kason and Curtis, gaming and laughing like boys do when the world ain't yet showed its teeth. Sometimes I'd go alone to the park where nature speaks in tongues older than words. Practice with sticks from the hardware store, testing balance like them old samurai. Carry my wooden sword too sometimes. Basketball court and tennis court stand empty now but memory holds the sound of balls hitting strings, daddy and Mr. Graves teaching what they knew of the game.\n\nTime moves like wind through dead grass. Stories pile up like autumn leaves. But the best ones, they ain't been lived yet. They wait out there in the dark, patient as hunger.",
            "The town aint much to look at. Just another dot on the map of South Carolina but it feeds more folk than youd reckon. Johnston they call it. Peach Capital of the World painted proud on a sign weathered by sun and time. The land spreads out like a quilt of orchards and pastures, peach trees standing sentinel over cattle that graze in the heat haze.\n\nHouses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming like mercury under the merciless southern sun or gray shingles dark as thunderheads. Fields stretch between them like a sea of green, livestock and crops claiming dominion over the earth. In town theres one stoplight swaying above a crossroads like a hanged man, marking where commerce tries to take root in this soil.\n\nThree places to eat if youre of a mind. Hong Kong run by a family who keeps to themselves, the Mexican place called Fiesta, and Garys where burgers slide off the griddle day and night. The pizza joint gave up its ghost not long past. Maxwell and Halford still stands, selling medicine and cherry cola that folks swear by like its holy water. IGA charges dear for groceries but folk mostly drive to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, leaving IGA for desperate times. Dollar General rules over all, packed from dawn till dusk with bodies seeking cheap necessities.\n\nThe furniture store called Possibilities sits like an aging matron, run by a woman everybody knows but nobody really knows. Two men haul her wares across town in a truck thats seen better days. Next door the pet shop tends to animals with more care than some show their kin.\n\nDoctor and vet both keep to the outskirts, small operations but enough to keep body and beast going. One school takes the young ones till they're old enough to bus to the next town over. No parks save whats coming - two and a half acres of promised recreation that may or may not save this place from its own quiet death.\n\nNo picture shows or bowling alleys or places for young blood to spill their restless energy. No paths for dogs to trot or children to play. Just a town small enough to miss in a blink, hanging on to its patch of earth like its the last place God remembered to make.",
            "We live here where the two highways meet and cross like veins in the earth, the traffic passing like blood through arteries ancient and eternal. Tennessee. A small town where the houses stand like sentinels against time itself. The neighbors we know by their shadows and their ways, their coming and going like the tide, predictable and constant. They work their yards with quiet determination, pushing mowers across patches of green that nature never intended, burning leaves in the fall like ritual fires of old.\n\nThe house stands at the corner where we watch them all pass. Four souls dwelling within. Me. The wife. Two daughters with ages marked by time like rings in a tree. Eleven. Fourteen. The seasons pass here like they always have. Winter brings the children sliding down the hill on the side street, their laughter echoing off the empty trees. Spring brings the mowers, their mechanical drone a constant companion from March till October when the grass finally surrenders to the cold.\n\nThe trees. They were here first. Their shadows fall across our lives like memories of a wilder time. Their leaves come down in autumn, golden and brown, to be gathered and burned in smoky offerings to the sky. These days winter comes less and less, like an old friend growing distant, leaving only the long autumn to remind us of what was.\n\nThe garage sits back from the house like a afterthought, doors open to the neighborhood when I work on the truck, metal on metal, grease and rust and time wearing away at all things. Holidays bring the strangers, kin to the neighbors, their cars lining the streets like metal insects at rest. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and go like seasons themselves.\n\nThrough it all the traffic flows past our corner, an endless river of metal and purpose, marking this place as something less than perfect but more than nothing. A testament to what we've built here in this carved-out space between the wild and the tame.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast brown carpet laid down by God himself, dirt and more dirt far as the eye can see. Brown everywhere and when you spot a patch of green you know some fool's burning money like kindling just to keep it that way. Back in the nineties the houses stood lonely and far apart like sentinels in the wasteland but now they've bred and multiplied though the spaces between them still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like some restless beast consuming the earth day by day. Good folk and bad folk both dwell here same as anywhere else though round my part it's mostly old timers, quiet and neighborly. Chain stores squat on corners like concrete toads, Food for Less and Smart and Final, but nothing fancy. You want that kind of shopping you got to drive and drive far.\n\nConstruction work rules these parts. Men with calloused hands and sun-leathered faces raising walls where once there was nothing. I'm one of them. Drywall and T-bar's my trade. The empty spaces call out to be filled but something in me wishes they'd stay empty. Left the big city behind and ain't keen on watching it follow me here.\n\nThe wildlife though. That's something else entirely. Creatures that crawl and slither and scurry across this unforgiving land, making homes where most would see nothing but death. My young ones, they're drawn to it like moths to flame. Out there now hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen, their small hands reaching into the mysteries of the ancient earth.\n\nThe county fair comes once a year like some traveling carnival of souls, bringing noise and light to the quiet desert. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like old men wear white beards, and down in the museum they keep pieces of the dead world - bones and stones and artifacts that whisper stories of what was here before. Stories of people who lived and died in this same dirt, under this same merciless sun. The high desert takes no prisoners but it gives up its secrets slow, one grain of sand at a time.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete kingdom, all angles and shadows and the long dark corridors between buildings where fluorescent lights hum eternal. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like what most folk would tell of. No picket fences here. No soccer moms in minivans. Just dormitories rising up like ancient monoliths and the perpetual migration of young souls between them.\n\nThe buildings stand testament to different tribes. Apartments where two or four souls share the confined spaces like monks in their cells, stacked two floors high with twenty bodies per structure. Then there's the houses, old weathered things scattered like afterthoughts across campus, where them that's graduated sometimes return to roost. Alumni they call them, though they might as well be ghosts of what came before. But it's the dormitories that hold the masses, great concrete beehives where hundreds sleep two by two in rooms no bigger than prison cells, though they don't see it that way.\n\nThe people here are like colors in some mad painter's palette, mixed and blended till you can't tell where one ends and another begins. Professional staff in their houses like lords in their manors, fresh-faced students in their dormitory caves, the older ones graduated to their apartment kingdoms. They come from everywhere and nowhere, bearing names that sound like music or warfare or both.\n\nThe stores stand like outposts in this academic wilderness. Places to eat, places to buy books and clothes emblazoned with school colors like tribal markings. A grocery that sells everything and nothing you need. And there's the park, a single green lung in this concrete body, kept pristine by some unspoken covenant between all who dwell here. At night it lies empty save for the occasional wanderer, during day it fills with the sounds of life, though what kind of life depends on who's telling the tale.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood, but it's mine all the same. A world contained within walls, bordered by learning and youth and the eternal cycle of coming and going. Some might call it strange but they don't understand. This here is a civilization all its own, complete as any other, more honest than most.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set his hand against it and pushed, and we live where the tilt begins, atop what folk call the workout hill on account of the joggers who come daily to test themselves against its grade. They walk in the road for there aint no other place to walk, the asphalt pocked and scarred like an old man's face. Above them the wires hang in webs, patched and mended from countless storms, a testimony to man's endless war with weather and wind.\n\nThe trees stand sentinel. Great evergreens that pierce the sky like spears, though the people here curse them and bring them down with saw and axe, for they block what all come here seeking - the ocean view. Houses rise like watchtowers, glass-faced and hungry for the sight of water, stacked one above the other in their greed for the horizon. When the sun sets the water burns like molten copper beneath a sky gone orange and raw, though most days the light filters weak through a gauze of clouds that never seems to lift.\n\nThe moss claims everything. It creeps and spreads with a patience older than time, turning roofs and rails and forgotten automobiles to fuzzy green monuments of neglect. Children are scarce here despite the schoolhouse that squats empty mere blocks away. The old folks have inherited this place, and with them came their dogs. The beasts roam like they own the streets, slipping through open doors uninvited, making themselves at home in stranger's houses like thieves who want nothing but company.\n\nRabbits too, big as cats, their burrows pockmarking lawns like shotgun holes. The gardeners wage their own private war against them, but it's the housecats that are winning, turning the neighborhood into their private hunting grounds. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds like floating jewels, and sometimes a hawk or eagle until the crows drive them off with their black wings and darker purpose.\n\nDown the hill where the land gives way to water there are places that serve up what the bay provides. No proper beach exists there, just rocks that wait to be thrown into the grey waters. The opposite shore looms close enough to touch through the eternal mist, like a promise just out of reach.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some sprawling beast in Brooklyn's belly, its streets a maze of iron and concrete where the subway cars screech their arrival like metal prophets. The neighborhood breathes with the pulse of the city yet maintains its own heartbeat, its own truth.\n\nIn recent years the Asians had come. Their stores now stand sentinel on every block, bright signs in foreign scripts marking their territory like totems. Markets and laundries mostly. Good places. Clean places. The locals know this and come in droves, their footsteps wearing smooth paths on the concrete, their dollars changing hands in these temples of commerce. Where I stand now you could throw a stone and hit four such markets, though that aint advisable.\n\nThe place aint purely Asian though. Its got layers like old paint, each wave of immigrants leaving their mark. First generation, second generation, all of them carrying their histories like invisible baggage. The park nearby is new-made, steel and concrete rising from old earth. Basketball courts spread out like a giant's gaming board, soccer fields stretched green and endless, handball courts standing like ancient ruins. Children play in the water fountains come summer, their laughter a counterpoint to the city's drone.\n\nNo towers of commerce cast their shadows here. Just the squat buildings of the working folk, mostly two-family affairs with their own histories written in brick and mortar. The people here got their own music, blasting from cars at all hours like some mechanical orchestra tuned to chaos. The engines roar their midnight symphonies, sleep be damned.\n\nNight brings its own rules. The darkness carries dangers old as time - thieves and bullies and men who'd hurt you just to pass the time. I knew their kind once, felt their fists. These days they steal packages from porches, modern-day bandits with no honor to speak of.\n\nAnd everywhere the dogs leave their offerings, city ordinances be damned. Their waste dots the sidewalks like some primitive trail markers, forcing pedestrians into an eternal dance of avoidance. The city's laws mean nothing to the dogs or their masters. That's the truth of it. That's Bensonhurst.",
            "You got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon fore you can understand anything else. Theres this word painted up on the wall of some building where they serve pizza and beer and music and naked women dancing and half of what goes on there aint strictly speaking legal but the word just says Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the darkness. Some folk say its about remembering how things was back before the money came. Others say its like a beacon calling out to them that dont fit nowhere else saying come here where your strangeness is a blessing not a curse.\n\nThe Californians keep coming. Rich ones mostly. The cranes keep turning, building towers of glass and steel to house them all but the weird persists like some old god that wont die. Not that weird means kind exactly. More like it means tolerating what other places wont abide. We still got our Walmarts and our Chinese goods same as anywhere. Got our share of normal too. Yoga studios. Hipsters drinking coffee. Men in suits walking fast to nowhere.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses wear colors like carnival clothes and gardens grow wild along the streets, herbs and flowers pushing up through cracks in the concrete. Come summer theres these boxes appear. Free boxes we call them. Cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic bags or wooden crates. They got this magic about them. Like offerings to some pagan god of refuse and recycling. Clothes mostly. Books. Sometimes stranger things. Walking these streets is like walking through some dream where anything might happen.\n\nBut thats just my kind of weird. Theres thousands of kinds here. Some folk wouldnt touch nothing from a sidewalk box but theyll do yoga with goats - real goats mind you - or scream themselves hoarse at soccer matches. Everyone here loves something fierce.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray clouds hanging low like wet wool and with them comes the darkness in peoples minds. We got our share of them that cant cope. Them that turn to drugs or end up sleeping rough. The city tries to help but its never enough. Never is anywhere. The rest of us we swing between wanting to help and wanting them gone and in that we aint weird at all. Just human. Same as anywhere else.",
            "They stood there always. North. Silent watchers of the sun's ancient passage across the heavens. Days would pass and the mind would forget but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Uncaring of man's trivial sufferings. And in moments when the spirit lay broken they'd call out with their voiceless song and the weary soul would turn to them and draw strength from their ageless presence. One day and then the next.\n\nThe university sprawled below them like some great beast at rest. Buildings of stone and concrete rose from manicured lawns where ponds reflected the sky. But the mountains ruled over all. The town spread out in patterns of brick and mortar, cafes where students gathered with their books and their coffee cups like supplicants before some caffeine altar. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks weathered and stained by time, telling tales of commerce and industry. Here the small town pretended at greatness, mimicking its urban neighbor until the facade crumbled at the library's edge where quiet returned like an old friend.\n\nThe city was two things at once. Urban and rural. Busy and peaceful. As if god himself couldn't decide what to make of it. Memories collected in its corners like dust. Some sweet as honey, others bitter as grave dirt. Friends laughing past rusted playground equipment in the dark hours. Mad dashes through crowded streets to catch some picture show in a theater too fine for such as them. And the ponds. The ponds watched it all. Witnessed tears falling at ungodly hours while turtles and waterfowl went about their appointed rounds, each creature knowing its place while man alone wandered lost.\n\nPast houses that could've been anywhere in America the walker moved northward where palm trees caught the first light like torches. And there they stood. Mountains old as time itself scraping at the dawn sky with their jagged fingers. Speaking without voice. Teaching without words. Enduring. Always enduring.",
            "Youd miss it if you werent looking. Just houses behind some storefronts like any other place where folk dont mean to live but do anyway. Past the husk of what was once a Whole Foods and behind them hotels that stand empty save summer reunions theres a whole world breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like broken matryoshka dolls laid out careful and deliberate by some giant hand. First ones got stories in the papers. Bad stories. But we dont speak on those cause sometimes evil just is what it is and sometimes it aint.\n\nThe other buildings though. They stand different. Unknown to most who pass through here like ghosts in the night. Cross the way theres a school where kids come to learn what the world already beat into their parents. Iron gates groan like ancient things and cars stack up while drivers curse the morning and their coffee goes cold. The road dies at another, park on one side and a place where broken people come to get fixed on the other. Got wicker chairs out front and a fan that just pushes the thick summer air around like God stirring soup.\n\nChildren spin in the grass like windmills made of flesh and bone while bees work the flowers like they always have and always will. Old folk walk dogs and eye the young ones suspicious, them with their boards and their clouds of sweet poison they breathe in thinking it makes them something more than what they are. Girls gather like birds on playground steel talking about whatever girls talk about these days while the world spins on without them.\n\nStrip mall stands sentinel. Sushi place never full but always there. Pool store. Nail shop. All of it lined up like markers on a grave. You could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish from the sea. The frozen yogurt place draws them young ones like flies to honey. They congregate with their plastic cups full of sugar and dreams, performing their rituals of youth while vapor trails follow them like ghosts of futures not yet lost. This here's a piece of the South that time forgot or maybe just chose to pass by, leaving it preserved like a bug in amber, waiting for something that aint never gonna come.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels in rows unending. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames like conjoined twins that cannot part. Mine sits quiet with its patch of earth before it and the narrow strip of concrete where the automobiles rest. These dwellings whisper tales of times when suburban life was the dream that all men carried in their hearts like scripture. That dream now fades like evening light across the western sky but these neighborhoods persist, testament to what was and what might still be.\n\nThe people here carry themselves differently now. The yards grow wild where once they were maintained with religious fervor. Yet automobiles still mark each house like tribal tokens and children play in the streets as if the world beyond held no meaning. The schoolhouse stands nine decades strong, a brick fortress where futures are forged while memories gather like dust in its corners. Churches stand empty save for ghosts of prayers long spoken while young men gather at basketball courts, their voices carrying across empty streets like coyote songs.\n\nThe houses wear different faces but their souls are cast from the same mold. There's a market run by Yemeni folk, Arabs alone in this sea of black faces. The streets stretch wide like rivers of asphalt where young boys play at football, scattering like quail when cars approach. Most folk here have roots deep as live oaks, their stories passed down like family bibles, speaking of times when neighbor knew neighbor and doors stayed unlocked against the night.\n\nWhere once stood a karate school now stands a pharmacy, testament to how dreams change shape like clouds across the sky. The movie house remains, showing pictures from yesteryear at prices that make the old folks smile while young ones pass it by like they pass by all things that speak of older times. The expressway runs past but never touches our town, kept at bay by elders who saw in its concrete arteries the death of something precious that cannot be named. They build a new school now and talk of mascots, as if such things could capture the spirit of a place where past and future war like ancient enemies seeking peace.",
            "The city stretches vast and merciless like some great concrete leviathan, its innards a maze of commerce and dwelling places strewn about with neither reason nor purpose save the blind machinations of progress. Streets wind between the buildings housing their merchants and their wares, some bearing names known across the land and others small nameless places where men scratch out their living in the shadow of corporate giants. The parks stand as green islands in this gray sea where children play while their mothers watch with tired eyes beneath the smog-stained sky.\n\nThe people here they come from everywhere and nowhere. They cluster in their tribes like primitive societies of old. The queers and the orthodox Jews and the Russians all carved out their territories in this urban wilderness, and beyond them lie the other kingdoms - Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia - all of them pressing against each other like tectonic plates threatening to crack and split the earth beneath.\n\nNobody walks here. They sit in their metal coffins burning fuel and cursing god while the sun crawls across the sky. Ten miles might as well be a hundred. Two hours to traverse what a man could walk in three, the roads glutted with machines stacked bumper to bumper like cattle in some hellish stockyard. And still they come. The builders raise their towers of glass and steel higher and higher toward heaven while the old residents watch and mutter dark prophecies about the coming times.\n\nHouses stand like relics from another age. Single dwellings and duplexes and little boxes stacked atop one another where families make their homes. But there aint no real community no more. Just strangers passing strangers in the night. Sometimes I remember the children I once knew who played in these streets, their laughter echoing off walls that now stand silent as tombstones in this concrete graveyard we call home.",
            "Where is it all, she said. The girl's eyes swept across the endless rows of corn that stretched like soldiers to the horizon. This is all there is, I told her. She'd never known such vastness. Where she came from the markets were close and the buildings pressed in around you like teeth. But here there was only space and sky and the stalks that moved like waves in the wind.\n\nWe drove on. The road was black and straight and empty save for the occasional rust-worn truck that passed like a ghost. I told her of my youth in this land. This Ohio. This place of dirt and seasons and silence. Past the flooded quarry where the water lay dark and still we came to the houses. Brick and stucco dwellings set back from the road on plots of grass kept neat as cemetery plots. German cars gleamed in driveways like alien artifacts.\n\nThe Korean lived there still. Ancient now but dedicated to his rituals of grass-cutting. His singing carried across the lawns, a counterpoint to the engine's drone. Once he'd been a healer of men but time had taken that from him like it takes all things. Now he was just a figure in the landscape, merged with his machine, both of them fading.\n\nMy house stood grey against the sky. The geese came and went like temporal things, harried by the small dog that lived to chase them. Behind the house the creek muttered its endless song, punctuated by bullfrogs and the low complaints of distant cattle. Across the wooden bridge we'd built lay wilderness. Real wilderness. Not the managed kind but the true sort where things grew as they would and died when they must.\n\nI'd spent my childhood there among those trees. Building shelters from found things. Stalking creatures that knew we meant them no harm. Other children came and went like phases of the moon.\n\nWinter transformed it all. The green world died and was reborn as something stark and pure. Trees that had blazed with color stood naked against the white sky. Snow came in the night like judgment, turning the known world strange. My sister and I built fortifications from ice and armed ourselves with frozen ammunition. We fought our small wars and made our peace and lay in the snow to leave the shapes of angels. We were timeless then. We were children and that was all we needed to be."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the land stretches out between farms and them tourist towns like a blanket pulled taut across the earth. Ain't no malls here. No big box stores with their fluorescent glow. No chain restaurants neither. Everything's a drive. But Lord if it ain't the most beautiful country you ever saw. Water everywhere. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, like twin mirrors held up to the sky. Beaches scattered like loose change, waiting for feet to find them.\n\nThe neighborhood sits like something out of time. Houses don't crowd each other none. Each one different from the last, wearing their years like badges. Some fixed up nice, others showing their age plain as day. Got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the Michigan soil. Aluminum siding gone silver with time. Colors everywhere, like God himself took to painting with whatever was left in his palette.\n\nYards spread wide. Children's things scattered about - trampolines reaching for sky, swing sets creaking in the wind. Gardens where folks grow what they can. Fences holding animals that ain't wild but ain't quite tame neither. These houses speak of work. Hard work. The kind that wears a body down but builds a life up.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things. Dogs and their people making their rounds. Bikes and skates on worn concrete. Folks know who belongs and who don't, like animals knowing their own kind. Someone's always cooking outside, smoke rising up like prayers. Wave to them and they wave back, caught in this dance of neighborly recognition.\n\nThe grass stays cut. Dead leaves don't linger. Bushes stand neat and trimmed like soldiers. Ain't nothing fancy here, but there's something true about it. Something that whispers home and safety and peace.\n\nGot the law close by, sheriff and his jail. Health department too. Recycling center humming with purpose. Baseball fields where voices carry across summer evenings, calling out names like roll call at church. Airport nearby, small planes growling overhead like metal birds.\n\nIce cream place within walking distance. Downtown too, if your legs are willing. Park eight blocks distant, where children pedal their bikes like pilgrims to sacred ground. This here's a good place. Real good place. The kind of place where a soul might rest and not feel the need to run no more.",
            "The houses stand like teeth in perfect rows, all cut from the same bone-white clay, all bearing the mark of some unseen hand that moves across this land with ruler and measure. The HOA they call it. A covenant written in bylaws and regulations that binds these dwellings in their uniformity. Each yard a testament to man's need to tame nature - patches of grass cut low like military haircuts, stones laid in geometric patterns, saplings that stand like prisoners awaiting judgment. Two-car garages yawn their dark mouths at the street.\n\nThe roads here are black and perfect, unmarred by time or elements, as if laid down yesterday and preserved in amber. No potholes mar these streets. The houses crouch low to the ground mostly, though some rear up two stories high like watchtowers in this domestic fortress. There aint no mailboxes standing sentry at each drive like you might expect. They cluster together at the street's end in metal arrays, all locked away behind little doors with little keys, like safety deposit boxes in some bank of correspondence.\n\nThis land sits at the edge of the city like a frontier outpost, where suburban order gives way to rural chaos. They built pools here, community pools with high fences and gates that click shut with the sound of security. Walking trails wind through the wildness beyond, paths beaten into submission by countless feet. You could run these streets for hours and never cross your own path twice.\n\nThe old folks claim most of this territory, their retirement dreams made manifest in stucco and tile. They watch. They wait. They tend their gardens with mechanical precision. Mixed among them are the younger ones, professionals with briefcases and schedules, marking time until they too grow old here.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own life, vast in numbers but somehow still carrying the heart of a small town in its concrete chest. Fifteen minutes drive through the arterial roads leads to the commerce - one mall standing like a cathedral to consumption, grocery stores both fancy and plain, outlets stripped bare of pretense where fluorescent lights hum their endless hymn over empty aisles. All the chains are here, their logos burning against the sky like modern totems. This is what we built here, what we maintain with our rules and our watching. This is civilization carved out of chaos, all clean lines and right angles, all safety and sameness stretching toward the horizon.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through digital ether like spectres. Strange thing to hear. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each turning of the moon and none I knew had heard such tales. Maybe it's the struggle that takes them. Some weep in their beds come nightfall, I know this. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it, learned to love the must of old toys and clothes hung dead in closets like preserved saints. Your nose dulls with the years. Might be the cigarettes or might be just the way of things but the fleamarket smell always wins out. Adulthood smells like magazines gone yellow on a piano that ain't been opened since God knows when. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking. Start at the far end and you can make your way through charity shops and libraries and places selling old books and curiosities like relics in a church of commerce. Downtown's thick with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like blood through veins but in the thrift stores there ain't no sound at all. Good place to lose yourself. More people come each year, more machines of steel and glass. They call it development. Some big digital empire planted its flag here and the city groans with growing like a child with fever. Makes me think of New York. Everyone got their own purpose and nobody asks nothing of nobody. You can wrap yourself in silence like a shroud and ain't nobody going to unwrap you. Not like down South where concern is currency. Here you keep your secrets and the city rolls past like waves on sand, eternal and uncaring.\n\nLife moves though. Got a pianist next door and singers above, their voices carrying through walls thin as paper. Ain't so much strangers sharing walls as people sharing life. We come together when need calls, mark births and deaths and help each other through the dark times. Lucky, I reckon. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food, carry mail like offerings between temples. They seem to like having me here and I like having them. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make it feel less like I went and ruined everything.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a collection of weatherbeaten structures that stand like forgotten sentinels in the midwestern dust. Here on the eastern edge where the poorest souls gather, where paint peels from clapboard sidings and screen doors hang askew, there exists a kind of truth that money cannot purchase. The people here nod and smile, their faces etched with stories untold, walking these streets like pilgrims in some forgotten ceremony.\n\nViolence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome prophet. Gunshots have rung out in the night. Blood has stained these streets. The neighbors boy, not yet twenty, fell outside a barroom last year, his life seeping into concrete while moths danced around the neon signs. We've lost souls to the white powder too, that modern plague that comes in little bags and leaves bodies in its wake like autumn leaves. The town fathers have built places for healing, dispensing orange bottles of hope and teaching folks how to bring back the dead with clear liquid in syringes.\n\nThe school stands like a fortress of childhood, a place where my boy goes each morning, different from the others but accepted all the same. They feed them there, all of them, no questions asked, no money changed. The teachers move through their days like saints in some secular religion, tending to the children of the poor and the children of those who have more than enough, making no distinction between them.\n\nWest of us the town preens itself, new asphalt gleaming in the sun, fresh paint and trimmed trees marking territory like some primitive boundary line. Our side remains raw, untended, true. Sixteen years we've walked these streets, lived in these walls, watched the seasons pass like migrating birds. The house aint much but it holds our breath and our dreams and that's enough. Some truths dont need explaining and some places mark you for their own and that's how it is here, in this town that most folks would pass through without a second glance, not knowing what they missed.",
            "The hill rises like some ancient god's throne, crowned with buildings that whisper tales of time gone past. Seven stories up I dwell, the old Theater house standing sentinel across the way, its weathered facade a testament to forgotten performances. Down the slope there's a place where games sing their electronic hymns and beer flows like communion wine, drawing pilgrims of all breeds when summer lays heavy on the land.\n\nThe park stretches vast against the urban sprawl, bordered by concrete walls where steps rise like the vertebrae of some buried beast. Winter brings the wanderers, their nylon shelters lined in rows precise as headstones, huddled against the rain that falls eternal in these parts. Not snow but water, endless water that seeps into bones and souls alike. They cluster together like wolves in the heart of the city, far from the wild places they call the jungle, seeking warmth in numbers and proximity to salvation - a family center where steam rises from showers like prayers.\n\nBut it aint the stone and mortar that speaks to me. Aint the architectural majesty scattered across these hills that roll down toward the great dark water. It's the blood memory of this place. Hilltop. A name that once carried death in its syllables, when gangs ruled these streets like warlords of old. Federal men came through like locusts, badges gleaming, guns drawn. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like myself who come seeking something raw and true.\n\nWhite folks say don't walk these streets after dark. Words born of fear and ignorance, echoing from times when hatred wore different masks. Maybe it's my skin, dark enough to pass, or maybe these streets know their own - those who understand the weight of history, the poison of prejudice that still seeps through the nation's foundations.\n\nThis hill, this home, pulses with life when darkness falls. Strangers offer warmth without warrant, laundry keepers extend mercy in minutes, concrete becomes shelter. Here I've sat invisible against shop fronts while grey skies weep, only to be seen, truly seen, by those who know that beauty and worth hide in unexpected places. They press crumpled bills into palms like secular blessings, their words a benediction in the gathering dark.",
            "I come to this place in the eighth grade of my schooling, a time when childhood bleeds into something darker and less forgiving. The houses stood like sentinels in the gathering dusk, two stories high and identical in their suburban uniformity. Two boys lived nearby then, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, both gone now but their ghosts remain, haunting the sidewalks where we once walked.\n\nThe people who first dwelt here when I arrived still persist, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the neighborhood like ancient threads in some vast tapestry. Children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. Most days pass in silence. The inhabitants keep to themselves save in times of need, like creatures in some unspoken covenant.\n\nThere's a park nearby, no more than a minute's walk through territory I've known since youth. Basketball hoops stand like gallows against the sky, witness to countless games played out in dust and sweat. Once took an elbow to the nose there, blood running hot and copper-tasting down my chin, but such wounds heal and memory has a way of favoring the good over the bad. Now I watch my cousin's children there, small things drawn to swings and slides like moths to flame, their joy pure and unweathered by time.\n\nThe streets around here speak in many tongues. Chinese food and Indian spices and Mexican corn, all of it mingling in the air like some strange communion. People don't walk much anymore though, preferring to summon their sustenance through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints squat on corners like toads, identical to every other suburb in this vast country. The stores stand shoulder to shoulder: Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco, names repeated across a thousand similar streets in a thousand similar towns.\n\nI've read tales of neighbor turning against neighbor, dark stories that bloom like nightshade across social media and evening news. But here we abide by older rules, simpler ones. Packages rest unmolested on porches. Children play without fear. And in the gathering dark, porch lights wink on one by one, like stars in some earthbound constellation.",
            "The college stands near where I lay my head and for this I am grateful though I know not why. Row upon row of weathered buildings line these streets like ancient sentinels, their facades telling stories of time's slow march. Bars and eateries dot the landscape like waystations in some urban exodus, their neon signs casting strange shadows across the crumbling concrete. They renamed one such establishment not long past, its prices now steep as cemetery walls though the spirits flow just the same.\n\nThe people here exist in a kind of limbo between academia and poverty, their lives intersecting in strange geometries. Children ghost these streets in the daylight hours, drawn to the schoolhouse that squats among the apartment blocks. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how I prefer it, though their herbal proclivities have prompted management to wage a futile war with industrial fresheners, a comedy that plays out in the narrow hallway like some absurdist theater.\n\nAncient buildings shoulder up against one another, their innards gutted and remade while their faces remain unchanged. Down the road stand newer structures, false prophets of luxury built on foundations of sand and greed, their high rents a testament to man's capacity for deception. A diner serves microwaved sustenance on paper plates like some post-apocalyptic café, while across the way a gas station stands sentinel, its fluorescent lights humming stories of minimum wage desperation.\n\nThe city's money brought new concrete and grass, as if nature could be purchased and planted like fence posts. Trees crowd my building like mourners at a wake, their stumps testament to some arboreal massacre. Behind us lies 43rd street, a darker mirror of our own, where broken sidewalks tell tales of neglect and shabby buildings hide behind leafy curtains. Crime moves through these streets like water, finding the path of least resistance, flowing from one complex to another without prejudice or pattern.\n\nYet I remain, tethered by economics and convenience to this place where university buses ferry the hopeful to and fro, and where my feet can carry me from home to classroom without need for mechanical intervention. It is a place of contradictions, of decay and renewal, of transience and permanence, and it is, for now at least, home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses scattered round the deadend road like dice thrown by some vagrant god. Folk here they know each other mostly. Stand in driveways come evening time talking bout nothing and everything while young uns mark the concrete with chalk colors or chase kites against the fading sky. Like time done stopped here. Like the world outside with its machines and gleaming screens cant touch this place. Fields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up against a sky so blue it hurts and clouds drift like lost sheep across the heavens.\n\nThen the sirens come. Wailing like souls damned in the darkness. Storm bells ringing out cross the land and we all scattered like quail to our holes. Me I took to the bathtub with the little dog trembling in my arms, purse and pillows clutched like talismans against the coming dark. The big dog wouldnt come. Just stood in the living room barking at demons he couldnt see. Then the hail come. Great chunks of ice hammering the earth like judgment day. When it passed the road steamed like some creature breathing in the night. Temperature dropped seventeen degrees like God turned down the thermostat. Ice melted soon as it touched ground hot enough to fry eggs on. Then the sun broke through and rain fell all at once and two rainbows stretched across the sky like bridges to somewhere else.\n\nThis place it aint like New Hampshire where I come from. Two bedrooms two baths in each unit but they aint all the same inside despite what you might reckon looking at em. I walk the field out back sometimes down to where the pond sits still as glass. Deer move through there like ghosts and mornings the bullfrog sings his ancient song. Forty minutes from Charlotte but might as well be another world. Roosters call out each dawn from farms scattered bout like seed and sometimes in the evening that old donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding gold in river mud. Sometimes the Lord he shows mercy even to them that aint looking for it.",
            "Ten years gone now since we come to this place. Memory stands like a weathered post in dry earth. First days was hard. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge with nothing but tears and the hollow ache of leaving behind what was known and loved. Mama and daddy they wanted better for me and my sister both. Better houses, better schools. A place where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nTime passed like water over stone. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange excepting Mr. Glen and his young ones, and Dennis who lived beside. Good folk. Like blood kin almost. I mind the time we all went to Mr. Glen's wedding, him getting hitched again. Something pure in that gathering. Something that spoke to what I wanted someday when I'd made my way in the world. Ms. Veda throwing that white garter and me catching it like it was sent by God himself. Though the flowers, they escaped me.\n\nWe danced that night. All of us. Marsharii, his daughter, moving like wind through summer grass. Ain't seen her since. World takes people where it will.\n\nThe neighborhood lies like a maze of streets and shadows, though now technology guides where once was only guesswork. Walked those streets with Kason and Curtis, gaming and laughing like boys do when the world ain't yet showed its teeth. Sometimes I'd go alone to the park where nature speaks in tongues older than words. Practice with sticks from the hardware store, testing balance like them old samurai. Carry my wooden sword too sometimes. Basketball court and tennis court stand empty now but memory holds the sound of balls hitting strings, daddy and Mr. Graves teaching what they knew of the game.\n\nTime moves like wind through dead grass. Stories pile up like autumn leaves. But the best ones, they ain't been lived yet. They wait out there in the dark, patient as hunger.",
            "The town aint much to look at. Just another dot on the map of South Carolina but it feeds more folk than youd reckon. Johnston they call it. Peach Capital of the World painted proud on a sign weathered by sun and time. The land spreads out like a quilt of orchards and pastures, peach trees standing sentinel over cattle that graze in the heat haze.\n\nHouses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming like mercury under the merciless southern sun or gray shingles dark as thunderheads. Fields stretch between them like a sea of green, livestock and crops claiming dominion over the earth. In town theres one stoplight swaying above a crossroads like a hanged man, marking where commerce tries to take root in this soil.\n\nThree places to eat if youre of a mind. Hong Kong run by a family who keeps to themselves, the Mexican place called Fiesta, and Garys where burgers slide off the griddle day and night. The pizza joint gave up its ghost not long past. Maxwell and Halford still stands, selling medicine and cherry cola that folks swear by like its holy water. IGA charges dear for groceries but folk mostly drive to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, leaving IGA for desperate times. Dollar General rules over all, packed from dawn till dusk with bodies seeking cheap necessities.\n\nThe furniture store called Possibilities sits like an aging matron, run by a woman everybody knows but nobody really knows. Two men haul her wares across town in a truck thats seen better days. Next door the pet shop tends to animals with more care than some show their kin.\n\nDoctor and vet both keep to the outskirts, small operations but enough to keep body and beast going. One school takes the young ones till they're old enough to bus to the next town over. No parks save whats coming - two and a half acres of promised recreation that may or may not save this place from its own quiet death.\n\nNo picture shows or bowling alleys or places for young blood to spill their restless energy. No paths for dogs to trot or children to play. Just a town small enough to miss in a blink, hanging on to its patch of earth like its the last place God remembered to make.",
            "We live here where the two highways meet and cross like veins in the earth, the traffic passing like blood through arteries ancient and eternal. Tennessee. A small town where the houses stand like sentinels against time itself. The neighbors we know by their shadows and their ways, their coming and going like the tide, predictable and constant. They work their yards with quiet determination, pushing mowers across patches of green that nature never intended, burning leaves in the fall like ritual fires of old.\n\nThe house stands at the corner where we watch them all pass. Four souls dwelling within. Me. The wife. Two daughters with ages marked by time like rings in a tree. Eleven. Fourteen. The seasons pass here like they always have. Winter brings the children sliding down the hill on the side street, their laughter echoing off the empty trees. Spring brings the mowers, their mechanical drone a constant companion from March till October when the grass finally surrenders to the cold.\n\nThe trees. They were here first. Their shadows fall across our lives like memories of a wilder time. Their leaves come down in autumn, golden and brown, to be gathered and burned in smoky offerings to the sky. These days winter comes less and less, like an old friend growing distant, leaving only the long autumn to remind us of what was.\n\nThe garage sits back from the house like a afterthought, doors open to the neighborhood when I work on the truck, metal on metal, grease and rust and time wearing away at all things. Holidays bring the strangers, kin to the neighbors, their cars lining the streets like metal insects at rest. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and go like seasons themselves.\n\nThrough it all the traffic flows past our corner, an endless river of metal and purpose, marking this place as something less than perfect but more than nothing. A testament to what we've built here in this carved-out space between the wild and the tame.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast brown carpet laid down by God himself, dirt and more dirt far as the eye can see. Brown everywhere and when you spot a patch of green you know some fool's burning money like kindling just to keep it that way. Back in the nineties the houses stood lonely and far apart like sentinels in the wasteland but now they've bred and multiplied though the spaces between them still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like some restless beast consuming the earth day by day. Good folk and bad folk both dwell here same as anywhere else though round my part it's mostly old timers, quiet and neighborly. Chain stores squat on corners like concrete toads, Food for Less and Smart and Final, but nothing fancy. You want that kind of shopping you got to drive and drive far.\n\nConstruction work rules these parts. Men with calloused hands and sun-leathered faces raising walls where once there was nothing. I'm one of them. Drywall and T-bar's my trade. The empty spaces call out to be filled but something in me wishes they'd stay empty. Left the big city behind and ain't keen on watching it follow me here.\n\nThe wildlife though. That's something else entirely. Creatures that crawl and slither and scurry across this unforgiving land, making homes where most would see nothing but death. My young ones, they're drawn to it like moths to flame. Out there now hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen, their small hands reaching into the mysteries of the ancient earth.\n\nThe county fair comes once a year like some traveling carnival of souls, bringing noise and light to the quiet desert. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like old men wear white beards, and down in the museum they keep pieces of the dead world - bones and stones and artifacts that whisper stories of what was here before. Stories of people who lived and died in this same dirt, under this same merciless sun. The high desert takes no prisoners but it gives up its secrets slow, one grain of sand at a time.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete kingdom, all angles and shadows and the long dark corridors between buildings where fluorescent lights hum eternal. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like what most folk would tell of. No picket fences here. No soccer moms in minivans. Just dormitories rising up like ancient monoliths and the perpetual migration of young souls between them.\n\nThe buildings stand testament to different tribes. Apartments where two or four souls share the confined spaces like monks in their cells, stacked two floors high with twenty bodies per structure. Then there's the houses, old weathered things scattered like afterthoughts across campus, where them that's graduated sometimes return to roost. Alumni they call them, though they might as well be ghosts of what came before. But it's the dormitories that hold the masses, great concrete beehives where hundreds sleep two by two in rooms no bigger than prison cells, though they don't see it that way.\n\nThe people here are like colors in some mad painter's palette, mixed and blended till you can't tell where one ends and another begins. Professional staff in their houses like lords in their manors, fresh-faced students in their dormitory caves, the older ones graduated to their apartment kingdoms. They come from everywhere and nowhere, bearing names that sound like music or warfare or both.\n\nThe stores stand like outposts in this academic wilderness. Places to eat, places to buy books and clothes emblazoned with school colors like tribal markings. A grocery that sells everything and nothing you need. And there's the park, a single green lung in this concrete body, kept pristine by some unspoken covenant between all who dwell here. At night it lies empty save for the occasional wanderer, during day it fills with the sounds of life, though what kind of life depends on who's telling the tale.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood, but it's mine all the same. A world contained within walls, bordered by learning and youth and the eternal cycle of coming and going. Some might call it strange but they don't understand. This here is a civilization all its own, complete as any other, more honest than most.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set his hand against it and pushed, and we live where the tilt begins, atop what folk call the workout hill on account of the joggers who come daily to test themselves against its grade. They walk in the road for there aint no other place to walk, the asphalt pocked and scarred like an old man's face. Above them the wires hang in webs, patched and mended from countless storms, a testimony to man's endless war with weather and wind.\n\nThe trees stand sentinel. Great evergreens that pierce the sky like spears, though the people here curse them and bring them down with saw and axe, for they block what all come here seeking - the ocean view. Houses rise like watchtowers, glass-faced and hungry for the sight of water, stacked one above the other in their greed for the horizon. When the sun sets the water burns like molten copper beneath a sky gone orange and raw, though most days the light filters weak through a gauze of clouds that never seems to lift.\n\nThe moss claims everything. It creeps and spreads with a patience older than time, turning roofs and rails and forgotten automobiles to fuzzy green monuments of neglect. Children are scarce here despite the schoolhouse that squats empty mere blocks away. The old folks have inherited this place, and with them came their dogs. The beasts roam like they own the streets, slipping through open doors uninvited, making themselves at home in stranger's houses like thieves who want nothing but company.\n\nRabbits too, big as cats, their burrows pockmarking lawns like shotgun holes. The gardeners wage their own private war against them, but it's the housecats that are winning, turning the neighborhood into their private hunting grounds. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds like floating jewels, and sometimes a hawk or eagle until the crows drive them off with their black wings and darker purpose.\n\nDown the hill where the land gives way to water there are places that serve up what the bay provides. No proper beach exists there, just rocks that wait to be thrown into the grey waters. The opposite shore looms close enough to touch through the eternal mist, like a promise just out of reach.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some sprawling beast in Brooklyn's belly, its streets a maze of iron and concrete where the subway cars screech their arrival like metal prophets. The neighborhood breathes with the pulse of the city yet maintains its own heartbeat, its own truth.\n\nIn recent years the Asians had come. Their stores now stand sentinel on every block, bright signs in foreign scripts marking their territory like totems. Markets and laundries mostly. Good places. Clean places. The locals know this and come in droves, their footsteps wearing smooth paths on the concrete, their dollars changing hands in these temples of commerce. Where I stand now you could throw a stone and hit four such markets, though that aint advisable.\n\nThe place aint purely Asian though. Its got layers like old paint, each wave of immigrants leaving their mark. First generation, second generation, all of them carrying their histories like invisible baggage. The park nearby is new-made, steel and concrete rising from old earth. Basketball courts spread out like a giant's gaming board, soccer fields stretched green and endless, handball courts standing like ancient ruins. Children play in the water fountains come summer, their laughter a counterpoint to the city's drone.\n\nNo towers of commerce cast their shadows here. Just the squat buildings of the working folk, mostly two-family affairs with their own histories written in brick and mortar. The people here got their own music, blasting from cars at all hours like some mechanical orchestra tuned to chaos. The engines roar their midnight symphonies, sleep be damned.\n\nNight brings its own rules. The darkness carries dangers old as time - thieves and bullies and men who'd hurt you just to pass the time. I knew their kind once, felt their fists. These days they steal packages from porches, modern-day bandits with no honor to speak of.\n\nAnd everywhere the dogs leave their offerings, city ordinances be damned. Their waste dots the sidewalks like some primitive trail markers, forcing pedestrians into an eternal dance of avoidance. The city's laws mean nothing to the dogs or their masters. That's the truth of it. That's Bensonhurst.",
            "You got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon fore you can understand anything else. Theres this word painted up on the wall of some building where they serve pizza and beer and music and naked women dancing and half of what goes on there aint strictly speaking legal but the word just says Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the darkness. Some folk say its about remembering how things was back before the money came. Others say its like a beacon calling out to them that dont fit nowhere else saying come here where your strangeness is a blessing not a curse.\n\nThe Californians keep coming. Rich ones mostly. The cranes keep turning, building towers of glass and steel to house them all but the weird persists like some old god that wont die. Not that weird means kind exactly. More like it means tolerating what other places wont abide. We still got our Walmarts and our Chinese goods same as anywhere. Got our share of normal too. Yoga studios. Hipsters drinking coffee. Men in suits walking fast to nowhere.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses wear colors like carnival clothes and gardens grow wild along the streets, herbs and flowers pushing up through cracks in the concrete. Come summer theres these boxes appear. Free boxes we call them. Cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic bags or wooden crates. They got this magic about them. Like offerings to some pagan god of refuse and recycling. Clothes mostly. Books. Sometimes stranger things. Walking these streets is like walking through some dream where anything might happen.\n\nBut thats just my kind of weird. Theres thousands of kinds here. Some folk wouldnt touch nothing from a sidewalk box but theyll do yoga with goats - real goats mind you - or scream themselves hoarse at soccer matches. Everyone here loves something fierce.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray clouds hanging low like wet wool and with them comes the darkness in peoples minds. We got our share of them that cant cope. Them that turn to drugs or end up sleeping rough. The city tries to help but its never enough. Never is anywhere. The rest of us we swing between wanting to help and wanting them gone and in that we aint weird at all. Just human. Same as anywhere else.",
            "They stood there always. North. Silent watchers of the sun's ancient passage across the heavens. Days would pass and the mind would forget but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Uncaring of man's trivial sufferings. And in moments when the spirit lay broken they'd call out with their voiceless song and the weary soul would turn to them and draw strength from their ageless presence. One day and then the next.\n\nThe university sprawled below them like some great beast at rest. Buildings of stone and concrete rose from manicured lawns where ponds reflected the sky. But the mountains ruled over all. The town spread out in patterns of brick and mortar, cafes where students gathered with their books and their coffee cups like supplicants before some caffeine altar. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks weathered and stained by time, telling tales of commerce and industry. Here the small town pretended at greatness, mimicking its urban neighbor until the facade crumbled at the library's edge where quiet returned like an old friend.\n\nThe city was two things at once. Urban and rural. Busy and peaceful. As if god himself couldn't decide what to make of it. Memories collected in its corners like dust. Some sweet as honey, others bitter as grave dirt. Friends laughing past rusted playground equipment in the dark hours. Mad dashes through crowded streets to catch some picture show in a theater too fine for such as them. And the ponds. The ponds watched it all. Witnessed tears falling at ungodly hours while turtles and waterfowl went about their appointed rounds, each creature knowing its place while man alone wandered lost.\n\nPast houses that could've been anywhere in America the walker moved northward where palm trees caught the first light like torches. And there they stood. Mountains old as time itself scraping at the dawn sky with their jagged fingers. Speaking without voice. Teaching without words. Enduring. Always enduring.",
            "Youd miss it if you werent looking. Just houses behind some storefronts like any other place where folk dont mean to live but do anyway. Past the husk of what was once a Whole Foods and behind them hotels that stand empty save summer reunions theres a whole world breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like broken matryoshka dolls laid out careful and deliberate by some giant hand. First ones got stories in the papers. Bad stories. But we dont speak on those cause sometimes evil just is what it is and sometimes it aint.\n\nThe other buildings though. They stand different. Unknown to most who pass through here like ghosts in the night. Cross the way theres a school where kids come to learn what the world already beat into their parents. Iron gates groan like ancient things and cars stack up while drivers curse the morning and their coffee goes cold. The road dies at another, park on one side and a place where broken people come to get fixed on the other. Got wicker chairs out front and a fan that just pushes the thick summer air around like God stirring soup.\n\nChildren spin in the grass like windmills made of flesh and bone while bees work the flowers like they always have and always will. Old folk walk dogs and eye the young ones suspicious, them with their boards and their clouds of sweet poison they breathe in thinking it makes them something more than what they are. Girls gather like birds on playground steel talking about whatever girls talk about these days while the world spins on without them.\n\nStrip mall stands sentinel. Sushi place never full but always there. Pool store. Nail shop. All of it lined up like markers on a grave. You could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish from the sea. The frozen yogurt place draws them young ones like flies to honey. They congregate with their plastic cups full of sugar and dreams, performing their rituals of youth while vapor trails follow them like ghosts of futures not yet lost. This here's a piece of the South that time forgot or maybe just chose to pass by, leaving it preserved like a bug in amber, waiting for something that aint never gonna come.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels in rows unending. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames like conjoined twins that cannot part. Mine sits quiet with its patch of earth before it and the narrow strip of concrete where the automobiles rest. These dwellings whisper tales of times when suburban life was the dream that all men carried in their hearts like scripture. That dream now fades like evening light across the western sky but these neighborhoods persist, testament to what was and what might still be.\n\nThe people here carry themselves differently now. The yards grow wild where once they were maintained with religious fervor. Yet automobiles still mark each house like tribal tokens and children play in the streets as if the world beyond held no meaning. The schoolhouse stands nine decades strong, a brick fortress where futures are forged while memories gather like dust in its corners. Churches stand empty save for ghosts of prayers long spoken while young men gather at basketball courts, their voices carrying across empty streets like coyote songs.\n\nThe houses wear different faces but their souls are cast from the same mold. There's a market run by Yemeni folk, Arabs alone in this sea of black faces. The streets stretch wide like rivers of asphalt where young boys play at football, scattering like quail when cars approach. Most folk here have roots deep as live oaks, their stories passed down like family bibles, speaking of times when neighbor knew neighbor and doors stayed unlocked against the night.\n\nWhere once stood a karate school now stands a pharmacy, testament to how dreams change shape like clouds across the sky. The movie house remains, showing pictures from yesteryear at prices that make the old folks smile while young ones pass it by like they pass by all things that speak of older times. The expressway runs past but never touches our town, kept at bay by elders who saw in its concrete arteries the death of something precious that cannot be named. They build a new school now and talk of mascots, as if such things could capture the spirit of a place where past and future war like ancient enemies seeking peace.",
            "The city stretches vast and merciless like some great concrete leviathan, its innards a maze of commerce and dwelling places strewn about with neither reason nor purpose save the blind machinations of progress. Streets wind between the buildings housing their merchants and their wares, some bearing names known across the land and others small nameless places where men scratch out their living in the shadow of corporate giants. The parks stand as green islands in this gray sea where children play while their mothers watch with tired eyes beneath the smog-stained sky.\n\nThe people here they come from everywhere and nowhere. They cluster in their tribes like primitive societies of old. The queers and the orthodox Jews and the Russians all carved out their territories in this urban wilderness, and beyond them lie the other kingdoms - Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia - all of them pressing against each other like tectonic plates threatening to crack and split the earth beneath.\n\nNobody walks here. They sit in their metal coffins burning fuel and cursing god while the sun crawls across the sky. Ten miles might as well be a hundred. Two hours to traverse what a man could walk in three, the roads glutted with machines stacked bumper to bumper like cattle in some hellish stockyard. And still they come. The builders raise their towers of glass and steel higher and higher toward heaven while the old residents watch and mutter dark prophecies about the coming times.\n\nHouses stand like relics from another age. Single dwellings and duplexes and little boxes stacked atop one another where families make their homes. But there aint no real community no more. Just strangers passing strangers in the night. Sometimes I remember the children I once knew who played in these streets, their laughter echoing off walls that now stand silent as tombstones in this concrete graveyard we call home.",
            "Where is it all, she said. The girl's eyes swept across the endless rows of corn that stretched like soldiers to the horizon. This is all there is, I told her. She'd never known such vastness. Where she came from the markets were close and the buildings pressed in around you like teeth. But here there was only space and sky and the stalks that moved like waves in the wind.\n\nWe drove on. The road was black and straight and empty save for the occasional rust-worn truck that passed like a ghost. I told her of my youth in this land. This Ohio. This place of dirt and seasons and silence. Past the flooded quarry where the water lay dark and still we came to the houses. Brick and stucco dwellings set back from the road on plots of grass kept neat as cemetery plots. German cars gleamed in driveways like alien artifacts.\n\nThe Korean lived there still. Ancient now but dedicated to his rituals of grass-cutting. His singing carried across the lawns, a counterpoint to the engine's drone. Once he'd been a healer of men but time had taken that from him like it takes all things. Now he was just a figure in the landscape, merged with his machine, both of them fading.\n\nMy house stood grey against the sky. The geese came and went like temporal things, harried by the small dog that lived to chase them. Behind the house the creek muttered its endless song, punctuated by bullfrogs and the low complaints of distant cattle. Across the wooden bridge we'd built lay wilderness. Real wilderness. Not the managed kind but the true sort where things grew as they would and died when they must.\n\nI'd spent my childhood there among those trees. Building shelters from found things. Stalking creatures that knew we meant them no harm. Other children came and went like phases of the moon.\n\nWinter transformed it all. The green world died and was reborn as something stark and pure. Trees that had blazed with color stood naked against the white sky. Snow came in the night like judgment, turning the known world strange. My sister and I built fortifications from ice and armed ourselves with frozen ammunition. We fought our small wars and made our peace and lay in the snow to leave the shapes of angels. We were timeless then. We were children and that was all we needed to be."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the land stretches out between farms and them tourist towns like a blanket pulled taut across the earth. Ain't no malls here. No big box stores with their fluorescent glow. No chain restaurants neither. Everything's a drive. But Lord if it ain't the most beautiful country you ever saw. Water everywhere. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, like twin mirrors held up to the sky. Beaches scattered like loose change, waiting for feet to find them.\n\nThe neighborhood sits like something out of time. Houses don't crowd each other none. Each one different from the last, wearing their years like badges. Some fixed up nice, others showing their age plain as day. Got basements you can see right from the street, dug deep into the Michigan soil. Aluminum siding gone silver with time. Colors everywhere, like God himself took to painting with whatever was left in his palette.\n\nYards spread wide. Children's things scattered about - trampolines reaching for sky, swing sets creaking in the wind. Gardens where folks grow what they can. Fences holding animals that ain't wild but ain't quite tame neither. These houses speak of work. Hard work. The kind that wears a body down but builds a life up.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things. Dogs and their people making their rounds. Bikes and skates on worn concrete. Folks know who belongs and who don't, like animals knowing their own kind. Someone's always cooking outside, smoke rising up like prayers. Wave to them and they wave back, caught in this dance of neighborly recognition.\n\nThe grass stays cut. Dead leaves don't linger. Bushes stand neat and trimmed like soldiers. Ain't nothing fancy here, but there's something true about it. Something that whispers home and safety and peace.\n\nGot the law close by, sheriff and his jail. Health department too. Recycling center humming with purpose. Baseball fields where voices carry across summer evenings, calling out names like roll call at church. Airport nearby, small planes growling overhead like metal birds.\n\nIce cream place within walking distance. Downtown too, if your legs are willing. Park eight blocks distant, where children pedal their bikes like pilgrims to sacred ground. This here's a good place. Real good place. The kind of place where a soul might rest and not feel the need to run no more.",
            "The houses stand like teeth in perfect rows, all cut from the same bone-white clay, all bearing the mark of some unseen hand that moves across this land with ruler and measure. The HOA they call it. A covenant written in bylaws and regulations that binds these dwellings in their uniformity. Each yard a testament to man's need to tame nature - patches of grass cut low like military haircuts, stones laid in geometric patterns, saplings that stand like prisoners awaiting judgment. Two-car garages yawn their dark mouths at the street.\n\nThe roads here are black and perfect, unmarred by time or elements, as if laid down yesterday and preserved in amber. No potholes mar these streets. The houses crouch low to the ground mostly, though some rear up two stories high like watchtowers in this domestic fortress. There aint no mailboxes standing sentry at each drive like you might expect. They cluster together at the street's end in metal arrays, all locked away behind little doors with little keys, like safety deposit boxes in some bank of correspondence.\n\nThis land sits at the edge of the city like a frontier outpost, where suburban order gives way to rural chaos. They built pools here, community pools with high fences and gates that click shut with the sound of security. Walking trails wind through the wildness beyond, paths beaten into submission by countless feet. You could run these streets for hours and never cross your own path twice.\n\nThe old folks claim most of this territory, their retirement dreams made manifest in stucco and tile. They watch. They wait. They tend their gardens with mechanical precision. Mixed among them are the younger ones, professionals with briefcases and schedules, marking time until they too grow old here.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own life, vast in numbers but somehow still carrying the heart of a small town in its concrete chest. Fifteen minutes drive through the arterial roads leads to the commerce - one mall standing like a cathedral to consumption, grocery stores both fancy and plain, outlets stripped bare of pretense where fluorescent lights hum their endless hymn over empty aisles. All the chains are here, their logos burning against the sky like modern totems. This is what we built here, what we maintain with our rules and our watching. This is civilization carved out of chaos, all clean lines and right angles, all safety and sameness stretching toward the horizon.",
            "First I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through digital ether like spectres. Strange thing to hear. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each turning of the moon and none I knew had heard such tales. Maybe it's the struggle that takes them. Some weep in their beds come nightfall, I know this. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it, learned to love the must of old toys and clothes hung dead in closets like preserved saints. Your nose dulls with the years. Might be the cigarettes or might be just the way of things but the fleamarket smell always wins out. Adulthood smells like magazines gone yellow on a piano that ain't been opened since God knows when. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking. Start at the far end and you can make your way through charity shops and libraries and places selling old books and curiosities like relics in a church of commerce. Downtown's thick with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like blood through veins but in the thrift stores there ain't no sound at all. Good place to lose yourself. More people come each year, more machines of steel and glass. They call it development. Some big digital empire planted its flag here and the city groans with growing like a child with fever. Makes me think of New York. Everyone got their own purpose and nobody asks nothing of nobody. You can wrap yourself in silence like a shroud and ain't nobody going to unwrap you. Not like down South where concern is currency. Here you keep your secrets and the city rolls past like waves on sand, eternal and uncaring.\n\nLife moves though. Got a pianist next door and singers above, their voices carrying through walls thin as paper. Ain't so much strangers sharing walls as people sharing life. We come together when need calls, mark births and deaths and help each other through the dark times. Lucky, I reckon. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food, carry mail like offerings between temples. They seem to like having me here and I like having them. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make it feel less like I went and ruined everything.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a collection of weatherbeaten structures that stand like forgotten sentinels in the midwestern dust. Here on the eastern edge where the poorest souls gather, where paint peels from clapboard sidings and screen doors hang askew, there exists a kind of truth that money cannot purchase. The people here nod and smile, their faces etched with stories untold, walking these streets like pilgrims in some forgotten ceremony.\n\nViolence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome prophet. Gunshots have rung out in the night. Blood has stained these streets. The neighbors boy, not yet twenty, fell outside a barroom last year, his life seeping into concrete while moths danced around the neon signs. We've lost souls to the white powder too, that modern plague that comes in little bags and leaves bodies in its wake like autumn leaves. The town fathers have built places for healing, dispensing orange bottles of hope and teaching folks how to bring back the dead with clear liquid in syringes.\n\nThe school stands like a fortress of childhood, a place where my boy goes each morning, different from the others but accepted all the same. They feed them there, all of them, no questions asked, no money changed. The teachers move through their days like saints in some secular religion, tending to the children of the poor and the children of those who have more than enough, making no distinction between them.\n\nWest of us the town preens itself, new asphalt gleaming in the sun, fresh paint and trimmed trees marking territory like some primitive boundary line. Our side remains raw, untended, true. Sixteen years we've walked these streets, lived in these walls, watched the seasons pass like migrating birds. The house aint much but it holds our breath and our dreams and that's enough. Some truths dont need explaining and some places mark you for their own and that's how it is here, in this town that most folks would pass through without a second glance, not knowing what they missed.",
            "The hill rises like some ancient god's throne, crowned with buildings that whisper tales of time gone past. Seven stories up I dwell, the old Theater house standing sentinel across the way, its weathered facade a testament to forgotten performances. Down the slope there's a place where games sing their electronic hymns and beer flows like communion wine, drawing pilgrims of all breeds when summer lays heavy on the land.\n\nThe park stretches vast against the urban sprawl, bordered by concrete walls where steps rise like the vertebrae of some buried beast. Winter brings the wanderers, their nylon shelters lined in rows precise as headstones, huddled against the rain that falls eternal in these parts. Not snow but water, endless water that seeps into bones and souls alike. They cluster together like wolves in the heart of the city, far from the wild places they call the jungle, seeking warmth in numbers and proximity to salvation - a family center where steam rises from showers like prayers.\n\nBut it aint the stone and mortar that speaks to me. Aint the architectural majesty scattered across these hills that roll down toward the great dark water. It's the blood memory of this place. Hilltop. A name that once carried death in its syllables, when gangs ruled these streets like warlords of old. Federal men came through like locusts, badges gleaming, guns drawn. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like myself who come seeking something raw and true.\n\nWhite folks say don't walk these streets after dark. Words born of fear and ignorance, echoing from times when hatred wore different masks. Maybe it's my skin, dark enough to pass, or maybe these streets know their own - those who understand the weight of history, the poison of prejudice that still seeps through the nation's foundations.\n\nThis hill, this home, pulses with life when darkness falls. Strangers offer warmth without warrant, laundry keepers extend mercy in minutes, concrete becomes shelter. Here I've sat invisible against shop fronts while grey skies weep, only to be seen, truly seen, by those who know that beauty and worth hide in unexpected places. They press crumpled bills into palms like secular blessings, their words a benediction in the gathering dark.",
            "I come to this place in the eighth grade of my schooling, a time when childhood bleeds into something darker and less forgiving. The houses stood like sentinels in the gathering dusk, two stories high and identical in their suburban uniformity. Two boys lived nearby then, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, both gone now but their ghosts remain, haunting the sidewalks where we once walked.\n\nThe people who first dwelt here when I arrived still persist, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the neighborhood like ancient threads in some vast tapestry. Children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. Most days pass in silence. The inhabitants keep to themselves save in times of need, like creatures in some unspoken covenant.\n\nThere's a park nearby, no more than a minute's walk through territory I've known since youth. Basketball hoops stand like gallows against the sky, witness to countless games played out in dust and sweat. Once took an elbow to the nose there, blood running hot and copper-tasting down my chin, but such wounds heal and memory has a way of favoring the good over the bad. Now I watch my cousin's children there, small things drawn to swings and slides like moths to flame, their joy pure and unweathered by time.\n\nThe streets around here speak in many tongues. Chinese food and Indian spices and Mexican corn, all of it mingling in the air like some strange communion. People don't walk much anymore though, preferring to summon their sustenance through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints squat on corners like toads, identical to every other suburb in this vast country. The stores stand shoulder to shoulder: Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco, names repeated across a thousand similar streets in a thousand similar towns.\n\nI've read tales of neighbor turning against neighbor, dark stories that bloom like nightshade across social media and evening news. But here we abide by older rules, simpler ones. Packages rest unmolested on porches. Children play without fear. And in the gathering dark, porch lights wink on one by one, like stars in some earthbound constellation.",
            "The college stands near where I lay my head and for this I am grateful though I know not why. Row upon row of weathered buildings line these streets like ancient sentinels, their facades telling stories of time's slow march. Bars and eateries dot the landscape like waystations in some urban exodus, their neon signs casting strange shadows across the crumbling concrete. They renamed one such establishment not long past, its prices now steep as cemetery walls though the spirits flow just the same.\n\nThe people here exist in a kind of limbo between academia and poverty, their lives intersecting in strange geometries. Children ghost these streets in the daylight hours, drawn to the schoolhouse that squats among the apartment blocks. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how I prefer it, though their herbal proclivities have prompted management to wage a futile war with industrial fresheners, a comedy that plays out in the narrow hallway like some absurdist theater.\n\nAncient buildings shoulder up against one another, their innards gutted and remade while their faces remain unchanged. Down the road stand newer structures, false prophets of luxury built on foundations of sand and greed, their high rents a testament to man's capacity for deception. A diner serves microwaved sustenance on paper plates like some post-apocalyptic café, while across the way a gas station stands sentinel, its fluorescent lights humming stories of minimum wage desperation.\n\nThe city's money brought new concrete and grass, as if nature could be purchased and planted like fence posts. Trees crowd my building like mourners at a wake, their stumps testament to some arboreal massacre. Behind us lies 43rd street, a darker mirror of our own, where broken sidewalks tell tales of neglect and shabby buildings hide behind leafy curtains. Crime moves through these streets like water, finding the path of least resistance, flowing from one complex to another without prejudice or pattern.\n\nYet I remain, tethered by economics and convenience to this place where university buses ferry the hopeful to and fro, and where my feet can carry me from home to classroom without need for mechanical intervention. It is a place of contradictions, of decay and renewal, of transience and permanence, and it is, for now at least, home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses scattered round the deadend road like dice thrown by some vagrant god. Folk here they know each other mostly. Stand in driveways come evening time talking bout nothing and everything while young uns mark the concrete with chalk colors or chase kites against the fading sky. Like time done stopped here. Like the world outside with its machines and gleaming screens cant touch this place. Fields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up against a sky so blue it hurts and clouds drift like lost sheep across the heavens.\n\nThen the sirens come. Wailing like souls damned in the darkness. Storm bells ringing out cross the land and we all scattered like quail to our holes. Me I took to the bathtub with the little dog trembling in my arms, purse and pillows clutched like talismans against the coming dark. The big dog wouldnt come. Just stood in the living room barking at demons he couldnt see. Then the hail come. Great chunks of ice hammering the earth like judgment day. When it passed the road steamed like some creature breathing in the night. Temperature dropped seventeen degrees like God turned down the thermostat. Ice melted soon as it touched ground hot enough to fry eggs on. Then the sun broke through and rain fell all at once and two rainbows stretched across the sky like bridges to somewhere else.\n\nThis place it aint like New Hampshire where I come from. Two bedrooms two baths in each unit but they aint all the same inside despite what you might reckon looking at em. I walk the field out back sometimes down to where the pond sits still as glass. Deer move through there like ghosts and mornings the bullfrog sings his ancient song. Forty minutes from Charlotte but might as well be another world. Roosters call out each dawn from farms scattered bout like seed and sometimes in the evening that old donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding gold in river mud. Sometimes the Lord he shows mercy even to them that aint looking for it.",
            "Ten years gone now since we come to this place. Memory stands like a weathered post in dry earth. First days was hard. Moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge with nothing but tears and the hollow ache of leaving behind what was known and loved. Mama and daddy they wanted better for me and my sister both. Better houses, better schools. A place where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nTime passed like water over stone. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange excepting Mr. Glen and his young ones, and Dennis who lived beside. Good folk. Like blood kin almost. I mind the time we all went to Mr. Glen's wedding, him getting hitched again. Something pure in that gathering. Something that spoke to what I wanted someday when I'd made my way in the world. Ms. Veda throwing that white garter and me catching it like it was sent by God himself. Though the flowers, they escaped me.\n\nWe danced that night. All of us. Marsharii, his daughter, moving like wind through summer grass. Ain't seen her since. World takes people where it will.\n\nThe neighborhood lies like a maze of streets and shadows, though now technology guides where once was only guesswork. Walked those streets with Kason and Curtis, gaming and laughing like boys do when the world ain't yet showed its teeth. Sometimes I'd go alone to the park where nature speaks in tongues older than words. Practice with sticks from the hardware store, testing balance like them old samurai. Carry my wooden sword too sometimes. Basketball court and tennis court stand empty now but memory holds the sound of balls hitting strings, daddy and Mr. Graves teaching what they knew of the game.\n\nTime moves like wind through dead grass. Stories pile up like autumn leaves. But the best ones, they ain't been lived yet. They wait out there in the dark, patient as hunger.",
            "The town aint much to look at. Just another dot on the map of South Carolina but it feeds more folk than youd reckon. Johnston they call it. Peach Capital of the World painted proud on a sign weathered by sun and time. The land spreads out like a quilt of orchards and pastures, peach trees standing sentinel over cattle that graze in the heat haze.\n\nHouses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming like mercury under the merciless southern sun or gray shingles dark as thunderheads. Fields stretch between them like a sea of green, livestock and crops claiming dominion over the earth. In town theres one stoplight swaying above a crossroads like a hanged man, marking where commerce tries to take root in this soil.\n\nThree places to eat if youre of a mind. Hong Kong run by a family who keeps to themselves, the Mexican place called Fiesta, and Garys where burgers slide off the griddle day and night. The pizza joint gave up its ghost not long past. Maxwell and Halford still stands, selling medicine and cherry cola that folks swear by like its holy water. IGA charges dear for groceries but folk mostly drive to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, leaving IGA for desperate times. Dollar General rules over all, packed from dawn till dusk with bodies seeking cheap necessities.\n\nThe furniture store called Possibilities sits like an aging matron, run by a woman everybody knows but nobody really knows. Two men haul her wares across town in a truck thats seen better days. Next door the pet shop tends to animals with more care than some show their kin.\n\nDoctor and vet both keep to the outskirts, small operations but enough to keep body and beast going. One school takes the young ones till they're old enough to bus to the next town over. No parks save whats coming - two and a half acres of promised recreation that may or may not save this place from its own quiet death.\n\nNo picture shows or bowling alleys or places for young blood to spill their restless energy. No paths for dogs to trot or children to play. Just a town small enough to miss in a blink, hanging on to its patch of earth like its the last place God remembered to make.",
            "We live here where the two highways meet and cross like veins in the earth, the traffic passing like blood through arteries ancient and eternal. Tennessee. A small town where the houses stand like sentinels against time itself. The neighbors we know by their shadows and their ways, their coming and going like the tide, predictable and constant. They work their yards with quiet determination, pushing mowers across patches of green that nature never intended, burning leaves in the fall like ritual fires of old.\n\nThe house stands at the corner where we watch them all pass. Four souls dwelling within. Me. The wife. Two daughters with ages marked by time like rings in a tree. Eleven. Fourteen. The seasons pass here like they always have. Winter brings the children sliding down the hill on the side street, their laughter echoing off the empty trees. Spring brings the mowers, their mechanical drone a constant companion from March till October when the grass finally surrenders to the cold.\n\nThe trees. They were here first. Their shadows fall across our lives like memories of a wilder time. Their leaves come down in autumn, golden and brown, to be gathered and burned in smoky offerings to the sky. These days winter comes less and less, like an old friend growing distant, leaving only the long autumn to remind us of what was.\n\nThe garage sits back from the house like a afterthought, doors open to the neighborhood when I work on the truck, metal on metal, grease and rust and time wearing away at all things. Holidays bring the strangers, kin to the neighbors, their cars lining the streets like metal insects at rest. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and go like seasons themselves.\n\nThrough it all the traffic flows past our corner, an endless river of metal and purpose, marking this place as something less than perfect but more than nothing. A testament to what we've built here in this carved-out space between the wild and the tame.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast brown carpet laid down by God himself, dirt and more dirt far as the eye can see. Brown everywhere and when you spot a patch of green you know some fool's burning money like kindling just to keep it that way. Back in the nineties the houses stood lonely and far apart like sentinels in the wasteland but now they've bred and multiplied though the spaces between them still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like some restless beast consuming the earth day by day. Good folk and bad folk both dwell here same as anywhere else though round my part it's mostly old timers, quiet and neighborly. Chain stores squat on corners like concrete toads, Food for Less and Smart and Final, but nothing fancy. You want that kind of shopping you got to drive and drive far.\n\nConstruction work rules these parts. Men with calloused hands and sun-leathered faces raising walls where once there was nothing. I'm one of them. Drywall and T-bar's my trade. The empty spaces call out to be filled but something in me wishes they'd stay empty. Left the big city behind and ain't keen on watching it follow me here.\n\nThe wildlife though. That's something else entirely. Creatures that crawl and slither and scurry across this unforgiving land, making homes where most would see nothing but death. My young ones, they're drawn to it like moths to flame. Out there now hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen, their small hands reaching into the mysteries of the ancient earth.\n\nThe county fair comes once a year like some traveling carnival of souls, bringing noise and light to the quiet desert. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like old men wear white beards, and down in the museum they keep pieces of the dead world - bones and stones and artifacts that whisper stories of what was here before. Stories of people who lived and died in this same dirt, under this same merciless sun. The high desert takes no prisoners but it gives up its secrets slow, one grain of sand at a time.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete kingdom, all angles and shadows and the long dark corridors between buildings where fluorescent lights hum eternal. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like what most folk would tell of. No picket fences here. No soccer moms in minivans. Just dormitories rising up like ancient monoliths and the perpetual migration of young souls between them.\n\nThe buildings stand testament to different tribes. Apartments where two or four souls share the confined spaces like monks in their cells, stacked two floors high with twenty bodies per structure. Then there's the houses, old weathered things scattered like afterthoughts across campus, where them that's graduated sometimes return to roost. Alumni they call them, though they might as well be ghosts of what came before. But it's the dormitories that hold the masses, great concrete beehives where hundreds sleep two by two in rooms no bigger than prison cells, though they don't see it that way.\n\nThe people here are like colors in some mad painter's palette, mixed and blended till you can't tell where one ends and another begins. Professional staff in their houses like lords in their manors, fresh-faced students in their dormitory caves, the older ones graduated to their apartment kingdoms. They come from everywhere and nowhere, bearing names that sound like music or warfare or both.\n\nThe stores stand like outposts in this academic wilderness. Places to eat, places to buy books and clothes emblazoned with school colors like tribal markings. A grocery that sells everything and nothing you need. And there's the park, a single green lung in this concrete body, kept pristine by some unspoken covenant between all who dwell here. At night it lies empty save for the occasional wanderer, during day it fills with the sounds of life, though what kind of life depends on who's telling the tale.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood, but it's mine all the same. A world contained within walls, bordered by learning and youth and the eternal cycle of coming and going. Some might call it strange but they don't understand. This here is a civilization all its own, complete as any other, more honest than most.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set his hand against it and pushed, and we live where the tilt begins, atop what folk call the workout hill on account of the joggers who come daily to test themselves against its grade. They walk in the road for there aint no other place to walk, the asphalt pocked and scarred like an old man's face. Above them the wires hang in webs, patched and mended from countless storms, a testimony to man's endless war with weather and wind.\n\nThe trees stand sentinel. Great evergreens that pierce the sky like spears, though the people here curse them and bring them down with saw and axe, for they block what all come here seeking - the ocean view. Houses rise like watchtowers, glass-faced and hungry for the sight of water, stacked one above the other in their greed for the horizon. When the sun sets the water burns like molten copper beneath a sky gone orange and raw, though most days the light filters weak through a gauze of clouds that never seems to lift.\n\nThe moss claims everything. It creeps and spreads with a patience older than time, turning roofs and rails and forgotten automobiles to fuzzy green monuments of neglect. Children are scarce here despite the schoolhouse that squats empty mere blocks away. The old folks have inherited this place, and with them came their dogs. The beasts roam like they own the streets, slipping through open doors uninvited, making themselves at home in stranger's houses like thieves who want nothing but company.\n\nRabbits too, big as cats, their burrows pockmarking lawns like shotgun holes. The gardeners wage their own private war against them, but it's the housecats that are winning, turning the neighborhood into their private hunting grounds. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds like floating jewels, and sometimes a hawk or eagle until the crows drive them off with their black wings and darker purpose.\n\nDown the hill where the land gives way to water there are places that serve up what the bay provides. No proper beach exists there, just rocks that wait to be thrown into the grey waters. The opposite shore looms close enough to touch through the eternal mist, like a promise just out of reach.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some sprawling beast in Brooklyn's belly, its streets a maze of iron and concrete where the subway cars screech their arrival like metal prophets. The neighborhood breathes with the pulse of the city yet maintains its own heartbeat, its own truth.\n\nIn recent years the Asians had come. Their stores now stand sentinel on every block, bright signs in foreign scripts marking their territory like totems. Markets and laundries mostly. Good places. Clean places. The locals know this and come in droves, their footsteps wearing smooth paths on the concrete, their dollars changing hands in these temples of commerce. Where I stand now you could throw a stone and hit four such markets, though that aint advisable.\n\nThe place aint purely Asian though. Its got layers like old paint, each wave of immigrants leaving their mark. First generation, second generation, all of them carrying their histories like invisible baggage. The park nearby is new-made, steel and concrete rising from old earth. Basketball courts spread out like a giant's gaming board, soccer fields stretched green and endless, handball courts standing like ancient ruins. Children play in the water fountains come summer, their laughter a counterpoint to the city's drone.\n\nNo towers of commerce cast their shadows here. Just the squat buildings of the working folk, mostly two-family affairs with their own histories written in brick and mortar. The people here got their own music, blasting from cars at all hours like some mechanical orchestra tuned to chaos. The engines roar their midnight symphonies, sleep be damned.\n\nNight brings its own rules. The darkness carries dangers old as time - thieves and bullies and men who'd hurt you just to pass the time. I knew their kind once, felt their fists. These days they steal packages from porches, modern-day bandits with no honor to speak of.\n\nAnd everywhere the dogs leave their offerings, city ordinances be damned. Their waste dots the sidewalks like some primitive trail markers, forcing pedestrians into an eternal dance of avoidance. The city's laws mean nothing to the dogs or their masters. That's the truth of it. That's Bensonhurst.",
            "You got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon fore you can understand anything else. Theres this word painted up on the wall of some building where they serve pizza and beer and music and naked women dancing and half of what goes on there aint strictly speaking legal but the word just says Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the darkness. Some folk say its about remembering how things was back before the money came. Others say its like a beacon calling out to them that dont fit nowhere else saying come here where your strangeness is a blessing not a curse.\n\nThe Californians keep coming. Rich ones mostly. The cranes keep turning, building towers of glass and steel to house them all but the weird persists like some old god that wont die. Not that weird means kind exactly. More like it means tolerating what other places wont abide. We still got our Walmarts and our Chinese goods same as anywhere. Got our share of normal too. Yoga studios. Hipsters drinking coffee. Men in suits walking fast to nowhere.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses wear colors like carnival clothes and gardens grow wild along the streets, herbs and flowers pushing up through cracks in the concrete. Come summer theres these boxes appear. Free boxes we call them. Cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic bags or wooden crates. They got this magic about them. Like offerings to some pagan god of refuse and recycling. Clothes mostly. Books. Sometimes stranger things. Walking these streets is like walking through some dream where anything might happen.\n\nBut thats just my kind of weird. Theres thousands of kinds here. Some folk wouldnt touch nothing from a sidewalk box but theyll do yoga with goats - real goats mind you - or scream themselves hoarse at soccer matches. Everyone here loves something fierce.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray clouds hanging low like wet wool and with them comes the darkness in peoples minds. We got our share of them that cant cope. Them that turn to drugs or end up sleeping rough. The city tries to help but its never enough. Never is anywhere. The rest of us we swing between wanting to help and wanting them gone and in that we aint weird at all. Just human. Same as anywhere else.",
            "They stood there always. North. Silent watchers of the sun's ancient passage across the heavens. Days would pass and the mind would forget but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Uncaring of man's trivial sufferings. And in moments when the spirit lay broken they'd call out with their voiceless song and the weary soul would turn to them and draw strength from their ageless presence. One day and then the next.\n\nThe university sprawled below them like some great beast at rest. Buildings of stone and concrete rose from manicured lawns where ponds reflected the sky. But the mountains ruled over all. The town spread out in patterns of brick and mortar, cafes where students gathered with their books and their coffee cups like supplicants before some caffeine altar. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks weathered and stained by time, telling tales of commerce and industry. Here the small town pretended at greatness, mimicking its urban neighbor until the facade crumbled at the library's edge where quiet returned like an old friend.\n\nThe city was two things at once. Urban and rural. Busy and peaceful. As if god himself couldn't decide what to make of it. Memories collected in its corners like dust. Some sweet as honey, others bitter as grave dirt. Friends laughing past rusted playground equipment in the dark hours. Mad dashes through crowded streets to catch some picture show in a theater too fine for such as them. And the ponds. The ponds watched it all. Witnessed tears falling at ungodly hours while turtles and waterfowl went about their appointed rounds, each creature knowing its place while man alone wandered lost.\n\nPast houses that could've been anywhere in America the walker moved northward where palm trees caught the first light like torches. And there they stood. Mountains old as time itself scraping at the dawn sky with their jagged fingers. Speaking without voice. Teaching without words. Enduring. Always enduring.",
            "Youd miss it if you werent looking. Just houses behind some storefronts like any other place where folk dont mean to live but do anyway. Past the husk of what was once a Whole Foods and behind them hotels that stand empty save summer reunions theres a whole world breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like broken matryoshka dolls laid out careful and deliberate by some giant hand. First ones got stories in the papers. Bad stories. But we dont speak on those cause sometimes evil just is what it is and sometimes it aint.\n\nThe other buildings though. They stand different. Unknown to most who pass through here like ghosts in the night. Cross the way theres a school where kids come to learn what the world already beat into their parents. Iron gates groan like ancient things and cars stack up while drivers curse the morning and their coffee goes cold. The road dies at another, park on one side and a place where broken people come to get fixed on the other. Got wicker chairs out front and a fan that just pushes the thick summer air around like God stirring soup.\n\nChildren spin in the grass like windmills made of flesh and bone while bees work the flowers like they always have and always will. Old folk walk dogs and eye the young ones suspicious, them with their boards and their clouds of sweet poison they breathe in thinking it makes them something more than what they are. Girls gather like birds on playground steel talking about whatever girls talk about these days while the world spins on without them.\n\nStrip mall stands sentinel. Sushi place never full but always there. Pool store. Nail shop. All of it lined up like markers on a grave. You could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish from the sea. The frozen yogurt place draws them young ones like flies to honey. They congregate with their plastic cups full of sugar and dreams, performing their rituals of youth while vapor trails follow them like ghosts of futures not yet lost. This here's a piece of the South that time forgot or maybe just chose to pass by, leaving it preserved like a bug in amber, waiting for something that aint never gonna come.",
            "The houses stand like weathered sentinels in rows unending. Some whole, some split asunder yet joined still in their aging frames like conjoined twins that cannot part. Mine sits quiet with its patch of earth before it and the narrow strip of concrete where the automobiles rest. These dwellings whisper tales of times when suburban life was the dream that all men carried in their hearts like scripture. That dream now fades like evening light across the western sky but these neighborhoods persist, testament to what was and what might still be.\n\nThe people here carry themselves differently now. The yards grow wild where once they were maintained with religious fervor. Yet automobiles still mark each house like tribal tokens and children play in the streets as if the world beyond held no meaning. The schoolhouse stands nine decades strong, a brick fortress where futures are forged while memories gather like dust in its corners. Churches stand empty save for ghosts of prayers long spoken while young men gather at basketball courts, their voices carrying across empty streets like coyote songs.\n\nThe houses wear different faces but their souls are cast from the same mold. There's a market run by Yemeni folk, Arabs alone in this sea of black faces. The streets stretch wide like rivers of asphalt where young boys play at football, scattering like quail when cars approach. Most folk here have roots deep as live oaks, their stories passed down like family bibles, speaking of times when neighbor knew neighbor and doors stayed unlocked against the night.\n\nWhere once stood a karate school now stands a pharmacy, testament to how dreams change shape like clouds across the sky. The movie house remains, showing pictures from yesteryear at prices that make the old folks smile while young ones pass it by like they pass by all things that speak of older times. The expressway runs past but never touches our town, kept at bay by elders who saw in its concrete arteries the death of something precious that cannot be named. They build a new school now and talk of mascots, as if such things could capture the spirit of a place where past and future war like ancient enemies seeking peace.",
            "The city stretches vast and merciless like some great concrete leviathan, its innards a maze of commerce and dwelling places strewn about with neither reason nor purpose save the blind machinations of progress. Streets wind between the buildings housing their merchants and their wares, some bearing names known across the land and others small nameless places where men scratch out their living in the shadow of corporate giants. The parks stand as green islands in this gray sea where children play while their mothers watch with tired eyes beneath the smog-stained sky.\n\nThe people here they come from everywhere and nowhere. They cluster in their tribes like primitive societies of old. The queers and the orthodox Jews and the Russians all carved out their territories in this urban wilderness, and beyond them lie the other kingdoms - Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia - all of them pressing against each other like tectonic plates threatening to crack and split the earth beneath.\n\nNobody walks here. They sit in their metal coffins burning fuel and cursing god while the sun crawls across the sky. Ten miles might as well be a hundred. Two hours to traverse what a man could walk in three, the roads glutted with machines stacked bumper to bumper like cattle in some hellish stockyard. And still they come. The builders raise their towers of glass and steel higher and higher toward heaven while the old residents watch and mutter dark prophecies about the coming times.\n\nHouses stand like relics from another age. Single dwellings and duplexes and little boxes stacked atop one another where families make their homes. But there aint no real community no more. Just strangers passing strangers in the night. Sometimes I remember the children I once knew who played in these streets, their laughter echoing off walls that now stand silent as tombstones in this concrete graveyard we call home.",
            "Where is it all, she said. The girl's eyes swept across the endless rows of corn that stretched like soldiers to the horizon. This is all there is, I told her. She'd never known such vastness. Where she came from the markets were close and the buildings pressed in around you like teeth. But here there was only space and sky and the stalks that moved like waves in the wind.\n\nWe drove on. The road was black and straight and empty save for the occasional rust-worn truck that passed like a ghost. I told her of my youth in this land. This Ohio. This place of dirt and seasons and silence. Past the flooded quarry where the water lay dark and still we came to the houses. Brick and stucco dwellings set back from the road on plots of grass kept neat as cemetery plots. German cars gleamed in driveways like alien artifacts.\n\nThe Korean lived there still. Ancient now but dedicated to his rituals of grass-cutting. His singing carried across the lawns, a counterpoint to the engine's drone. Once he'd been a healer of men but time had taken that from him like it takes all things. Now he was just a figure in the landscape, merged with his machine, both of them fading.\n\nMy house stood grey against the sky. The geese came and went like temporal things, harried by the small dog that lived to chase them. Behind the house the creek muttered its endless song, punctuated by bullfrogs and the low complaints of distant cattle. Across the wooden bridge we'd built lay wilderness. Real wilderness. Not the managed kind but the true sort where things grew as they would and died when they must.\n\nI'd spent my childhood there among those trees. Building shelters from found things. Stalking creatures that knew we meant them no harm. Other children came and went like phases of the moon.\n\nWinter transformed it all. The green world died and was reborn as something stark and pure. Trees that had blazed with color stood naked against the white sky. Snow came in the night like judgment, turning the known world strange. My sister and I built fortifications from ice and armed ourselves with frozen ammunition. We fought our small wars and made our peace and lay in the snow to leave the shapes of angels. We were timeless then. We were children and that was all we needed to be."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland meets them tourist towns like old friends meetin at a crossroads. Ain't no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores with their bright lights and empty promises. Everything's a drive. Everything's a journey.\n\nThe water surrounds us like God's own embrace. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of em blue as judgment day. Everywhere you turn there's water waitin to baptize your feet in its cold mercy.\n\nThe houses stand like congregants at an old time revival, each one different, each one with its own history written in wood and nail and time. Some got new faces, some wear their age like medals. Most got these basements you can see from the road, like the earth opened up and swallowed part of em whole. The aluminum siding's gone gray and weary on many, weathered by seasons uncounted. Colors everywhere. Like God himself got drunk on paint one day and threw it all across the neighborhood.\n\nYards stretch out like promises. Kids' dreams scattered across em in the shape of trampolines and swing sets. Gardens grow where hope takes root. Fences mark the boundaries where folks keep their animals, keep their lives contained.\n\nThese are working people's homes. The kind of folk who wear their labor like skin and raise their young with calloused hands. Children run wild in the streets like scattered birds. Dogs walk their people. Bikes spin their wheels in the dying light. Neighbors know each other's shadows. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear.\n\nThe lawns stay trimmed like Sunday haircuts. No dead leaves permitted to rest. Everything maintained, everything in its place, like the order might keep chaos at bay. Ain't beautiful in the way fancy folks think of beautiful, but it's got something better. Got truth. Got peace.\n\nThe law sits close by, sheriff and jail both, like old testament prophets watching over their flock. The health department. The recycling center where folks bring their discarded dreams. Baseball fields echo with voices calling out names like prayers into the evening air. Small planes drone overhead like mechanical angels, coming and going from the airport that sits like a promise of escape.\n\nIce cream's within walking distance. Downtown too, if your legs got the faith. Kids can ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks of freedom stretched out before them. This here's a good place. A true place. The kind of place where America still dreams its old dreams and believes in em too.",
            "They built it all the same. Row after row of houses like children's blocks laid out by some vast and methodical hand. The HOA's presence hung over it all like a wraith, unseen but felt in every trimmed blade and painted shutter. Houses stood shoulder to shoulder, each with its measured plot of grass and scattered stone, driveways short as winter days. Trees grew where they were told, stunted things that gave no shade. Two-car garages lined up like grave markers.\n\nThe roads stretched out black and perfect, untouched by the violence of frost or neglect. No potholes marred the surface, as if decay itself had been legislated away. Most dwellings squatted low to the earth but some rose up two stories, reaching toward something they'd never grasp. The mailboxes stood in steel congregations at the street's end, uniform and cold, locked away from thieves and chaos. Package lockers gaped like empty mouths.\n\nThe neighborhood sat at the city's edge where civilization met wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land spread out vast and empty, punctuated by community pools behind their iron gates, walking trails that wound like asphalt serpents through the scrubland. Folk walked their dogs there or wandered alone in the gloaming. You could run till your legs gave out and never leave these borders.\n\nMostly it was the old ones who lived here. Retirees who'd come to die in peace, watching from behind their windows. Some younger souls mixed in, professionals with their briefcases and pressed shirts, but they were fewer. The city beyond sprawled large but carried itself like a small town, one mall standing sentinel over commerce. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to the stores - high-end markets with their organic promises, discount shops with their fluorescent desperation.\n\nIt was safe here. That's what they all said. Safe and maintained and proper. The pools gleamed blue in summer sun, the trails stretched out empty and waiting. Everything a body could want, they said, just a short drive away. But at night, when the sun bled out behind the identical rooflines, something else stirred in the spaces between the sameness, something that remembered what this land had been before the concrete came.",
            "First I heard tell of this place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through wire and static like old ghosts. Strange thing. The units here they cost dear, thousand dollars or more each month gone to wind and nobody I knew had heard such tales. Maybe its the weight of living bears down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper, friends trying to hold together what little they got. We learned to scrape by. Years teach you to love the smell of other peoples castoffs, the musty sweetness of old toys and clothes wrapped in paper, mothballs like little white deaths. Your nose forgets in time. Maybe its the cigarettes or maybe the world just wears you down till you dont notice no more. But that fleamarket smell it gets in deep. Adulthood smells like magazines gone yellow stacked on piano keys nobody plays no more. Gets in the leather and wont wash out.\n\nThree secondhand stores walking distance. Start at the far end you can hit two charity shops, library with its paper smell, man selling rare books, shop full of curiosities. Downtown packed tight with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like water but step inside them shops and the world goes quiet as a grave. Good place to lose yourself. Every year more comes, more metal more flesh. They call it developing. Some big internet empire made its home here, growing pains they say. Makes me think on New York. Everybody got their own heading, nobody asks nothing of nobody. You can keep to yourself, quiet-like, independent, and folks let you be. Aint like down South where caring means getting in folks business. Here you stay in your shell long as you want and the city just rolls past like the ocean we got.\n\nPlace stays alive though. Got piano player next door, two trying to be singers up above. Less strangers more like family now. We come together when needs must, mark the birthdays and the funerals, help each other best we can. Lucky maybe. Like my neighbors well enough and they treat me fair. I mind my mess and share my food, they do the same. Pass mail back and forth like peace offerings. Good to see them and reckon they feel same about me. Living in this big cold machine of glass and steel but its them makes me think I aint ruined nothing after all.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something else entirely. Our quarter sits on the eastern edge where the houses stand weathered and bent like old men waiting. Not rich folk here. Most rent. Some own but all scratch out their days in dwellings worth less than the memories they hold.\n\nThe people here they nod and speak when you pass. Good people mostly. Violence visits sometimes like an unwelcome relative that won't stay gone. Shots ring out in the night. Bodies fall. The neighbors boy went down outside MacGruder's Bar last spring. Just went down and didn't get up again. We've been lucky. Lost nothing save what we were foolish enough to leave on the porch come nightfall.\n\nThe poison that's taken half the country hasn't spared us neither. Fentanyl's got its hooks in deep. Bodies stack up like cordwood in winter. Town's got places for them that want help. Training for them that want to save someone. Sometimes it works. Mostly it don't.\n\nYet there's good here too. The school where my boy goes stands like a fortress against the darkness. Teachers there treat him right despite his differences. No meanness follows him through those halls. The women of the PTO work like ants building community one event at a time. Every child eats free cause hunger don't care what side of town you're from.\n\nThe council men they pour money into the center of town like water into sand. New roads. Parks with fresh paint. Gardens where weeds once stood. But the east side sees none of it. Money flows west where the shoppers go and the cars pass through. East side folks watch and wait and talk about injustice in low voices.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house ain't much but it holds us. Keeps the rain out. Keeps us warm. Stores sell what we need. People know us. Sometimes at night I think about leaving but I know we won't. Some places get in your blood like a fever and won't let go. This is such a place.",
            "The hill rises like some ancient altar, crowned with buildings that remember. Seven stories up I dwell, the old theater watching silent across the way, and down below there's this place where folk gather when the summer heat bleeds into night, a bar with machines that ping and flash and draw the masses like moths to flame. They queue there, patient in the thick June air, July air, waiting for their turn at whatever salvation lies within.\n\nUphill the park sprawls vast and concrete-bound, its steps cut deep into walls that hold no memory. Winter brings the dispossessed, their canvas homes lined like soldiers' graves along the walks and stairs. Rain comes more than snow, brutal and cold, driving them together for warmth in the city's heart rather than out where the wild things grow. They walk or ride to wash where they can, the family center standing lone sentinel in miles of urban waste.\n\nBut it aint the old buildings that make this place, though they stand proud enough, scattered cross the hills that tumble oceanward. It's the people carry the real history here. Hilltop, they called it, when blood ran in gutters and gang wars painted these streets red. Federal men came through like God's own wrath, DEA badges glinting like false stars. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like me who came after.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though others still name it rough country. White folk, they say, best clear out after dark. But that's old poison talking, the kind that seeps through generations like bad water through limestone. Maybe it's my skin, dark enough to pass, or maybe Hilltop sees what's truly in a soul. These streets know the weight of racism, know how fear breeds in ignorance like rats in walls, even here in this supposed melting pot paradise.\n\nThis much I know true: Hilltop's got my bones now. These night streets pulse with life, and strangers offer warmth before threat. Laundry women keep doors open past closing just to shelter a charging phone, and concrete storefronts become sanctuaries. Even when I try to fade into shadow, someone always sees. They press wrinkled bills into palms and speak of beauty and worth like prophets of some new religion. This is home, and it holds its own terrible grace.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade, the houses standing like sentinels in the gathering dusk. Strange and lonesome at first until I found kinship with two boys who lived along that same stretch of asphalt. They're gone now but the memories remain like shadows cast by a setting sun. The old neighbors persist, their faces weathered by time but unchanged in their routines.\n\nThe houses rise two stories tall, cookie-cutter monuments to suburban dreams. Children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and perfectly trimmed hedges. Most days the quiet settles like dust. The people here keep to themselves except in times of need, a silent covenant between strangers sharing the same patch of earth. Packages appear and remain untouched on porches, a testament to some lingering trust in human nature.\n\nThe park lies just beyond, a small stretch of green where memories collect like fallen leaves. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked courts where we played our games, the concrete holding stories of triumph and blood. One day my nose burst red against someone's elbow in a football game, but such wounds heal and good memories outweigh the bad like light outweighs shadow. Now I watch my cousin's children chase their own joy there, their small bodies arcing through space on swing sets, their excitement pure and uncontained.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within walking distance. Though nowadays people summon their meals through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints stand on every corner like modern-day trading posts. The stores stock everything a body might need, from medicine to groceries to spices from the old country. Even got an Indian market where the air hangs heavy with cardamom and cumin.\n\nI've come to know this place like the back of my hand, grateful for its quiet dignity when I read tales of neighborhood wars and porch pirates in other places. Some folks don't know how good they got it till they see how bad it could be.",
            "The college stands near where I lay my head. Not far. Walking distance. Buildings rise up like concrete monoliths, weathered and old, their faces worn by time and indifference. Bars and eateries dot the streets between, some cheaper than others, some renamed in vain attempts at reinvention. The new one charges more but the spirits flow just the same.\n\nPeople here exist in two tribes: the students with their books and dreams, and the poor with their burdens. Children too, countless, drawn by the elementary school that squats beyond the asphalt. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how it'll stay. They fill the halls with sweet smoke and management's response was to mount some perfumed contraption across their door. A joke told in plastic and chemicals.\n\nThe buildings stand like tired sentinels. Some wear new faces inside their old bones. Down the way they've raised new apartments, built quick and cheap, charging gold for copper. A sin against honest architecture but they know the students will come. They always come.\n\nThere's a place serves food on paper plates. Microwave hum their constant prayer. Gas station across the way. Bad place to work they say. City money brought new concrete though. Wide sidewalks. Grass growing where there wasn't before. Nature tamed and parceled.\n\nTrees shelter my building like ancient guardians. Some fell to the saw, their stumps testament to their last stand. More trees here than down the road where the light hits harder. Behind us lies 43rd street, meaner somehow. Broken sidewalks like a mouthful of bad teeth. Buildings trying to hide their shame behind green curtains of leaves. Violence visits there more often, though it knows no boundaries. Crosses the street sometimes to where the wanderers live in their temporary homes.\n\nBut this place suits me well enough. Money flows easier here and the necessities of life stand close. The university and its promise remains within reach, and the buses come regular as heartbeats, carrying people to store and city alike. Some might call it home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all but rather houses strung along the curved road like beads on some great necklace. Folk here they know each other mostly. They gather in the gloaming at the end of drives not chosen but found and speak of things that matter little while their young ones mark the concrete with chalk or chase kites against the dimming sky. Like some forgotten time. Like the world aint gone mad with its screens and circuits and endless hum of progress.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees stand ancient witness while clouds white as bone drift across the blue vault above. But the weather it turns cruel sometimes. Last night the sirens wailed their banshee song and we all knew what it meant. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever precious things I could gather while the big one paced and barked at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles scattered across the earth. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cool, temperature falling like a stone from ninety-two to seventy-five. The ice melted where it struck leaving ghost marks on the pavement.\n\nThen the sun broke through and rain fell still and there appeared above us twin arcs of color like some covenant with the sky. Captured it with the camera though such things aint meant for keeping. People emerged slow from their shelters like creatures after flood, and life took up its rhythm again. Women calling children home to supper.\n\nThis place it speaks different from New Hampshire. Got its own tongue, soft and sweet as honey. The houses mirror each other outside but inside they're as different as the folk who dwell in them. Behind my place theres a field stretches down to a pond where no one swims and sometimes deer step quiet in the dawn while bullfrogs sing their ancient songs. Charlotte lies forty minutes distant but here the roosters still announce the morning and somewhere in the gathering dark a donkey brays his lonesome prayer. Like some village lost to time, found again in this corner of North Carolina. A place that still remembers what it means to be a place.",
            "Ten years now. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. First light of Stockbridge felt wrong after Riverdale, like wearing someone else's skin. Tears came unbidden. Mother and father, they wanted better. Better schools, better houses, better lives for their young. Away from what folk called the ghetto though such words mean little to children who know only home.\n\nTime passes like water through fingers. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange except for Glen and Dennis who lived adjacent. Good people. Family almost, if blood weren't the judge of such things. Remember Glen's wedding clear as yesterday's sun. Him getting married again, wife in white. Veda, they called her. She threw that white garter and somehow it found my hand though the flowers went elsewhere. We danced. All of us. Marsharii, Glen's daughter, she danced too. Ain't seen her since. World takes people where it will.\n\nThe streets here wind like serpents but technology guides now where feet once wandered blind. Kason and Curtis, we'd game together. Young men killing time like it was endless. The park became sanctuary. Something holy in the quiet there. Brought sticks from the hardware store, practice balance like them eastern warriors. Wooden sword too sometimes. Basketball court and tennis lanes lay empty now but memory serves up old games. Father and Mr. Graves teaching tennis, working us till sweat ran rivers. Joy in the work though. Always joy.\n\nNeighborhood holds stories like earth holds bones. Some rise up, others stay buried. But like them preachers say, best is yet to come. Though who can say what best means in a world that turns regardless of our wishes.",
            "The town dont stand apart from any other in South Carolina but it carries the weight of peaches on its back like some ancient burden. Johnston they call it. Peach Capital of the World emblazoned on a sign weathered and proud against the sky. The land stretches vast and empty save for the peach trees standing like sentinels in ordered rows or the black cattle that dot the fields like moving shadows.\n\nHouses stand apart from one another like strangers at a wake. Metal roofs gleam under the merciless southern sun or gray shingles fade like old memories. They squat back from the road behind fields where beasts graze and crops rise from the red earth. The town proper hangs suspended around a single stoplight, its red eye blinking at the crossroads where commerce gatheres like vultures at a carcass.\n\nThree places serve what passes for sustenance: the Chinese family at Hong Kong, their faces worn smooth like river stones, the Mexicans at their Fiesta, and Gary's where burgers slide across greased counters. The pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford, deals in medicines and cherry cola, each equally addictive to the locals. IGA stands alone, a grocery outpost charging siege prices while the townfolk flee to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville like refugees seeking sanctuary.\n\nDollar General rules this kingdom of small needs, its aisles always full, a bazaar of plastic and necessity. The furniture woman tends her store of possibilities like a garden, her two movers strong as oxen carrying couches across thresholds. Next door they wash dogs at Clark's, soap and water bringing order to chaos.\n\nThe doctors tend to man and beast in separate buildings on the outskirts, like some biblical separation. Children learn their letters at Johnston Elementary until fifth grade sends them away like young exiles to the next town over. They speak of parks to come, two and a half acres of manufactured pleasure, but for now the land remains raw and untamed.\n\nNo picture shows, no bowling alleys, no gathering places where youth might congregate like starlings on a wire. Just earth and sky and peach trees and cattle, a town so small you might pass through it between heartbeats, like a dream half-remembered in the morning light.",
            "We live where the asphalt runs between two highways in the southern part of Tennessee, the road black and endless and carrying the burden of too many strangers passing through. The houses stand like tired sentinels, their occupants long familiar to us now, their faces worn by time and weather and the daily rituals that bind them to this place. They move about their yards like penitents, raking leaves that fall eternal from ancient trees that stood here before any of us drew breath.\n\nThe house sits at the corner where we watch the world pass. Four souls dwell within. Me and the wife and two girls, eleven and fourteen, their youth still unmarked by time. We know the machines that pass, their engines humming familiar songs, and when strange metal beasts prowl our streets we mark them well, our eyes following their passage like wary predators.\n\nWinter brings children to the hill on the side street, their sleds cutting dark paths in virgin snow. But winters grow weak now, mere shadows of seasons past, and fall stretches long and dark across the calendar like a dying man's shadow. The mowers drone from spring until the dying time of October, their mechanical voices a chorus that echoes through the trees that crowd our lots like wooden armies.\n\nThe garage stands rear-ward, dark and waiting. When I work there the doors yawn open like great metal maws and I can taste the neighborhood on my tongue. Smell the smoke from burning leaves that marks the death of summer. Watch the barbecue smoke rise from back decks like signals from ancient tribes. Holiday times bring strange cars and foreign faces, metal and flesh crowding the streets like refugees from some distant war.\n\nWe rarely use the front door. It stands like a forgotten sentinel, its knock a rare herald of the outside world trying to breach our sanctuary. The traffic flows endless past our corner, a river of metal and exhaust that mars what might otherwise be perfect. But this is our place and we abide here, watching the seasons turn and the leaves fall and the children grow beneath these ancient trees that remember more than any of us ever will.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast brown altar, dirt and more dirt reaching toward mountains that stand ancient and indifferent. A man who ain't lived here don't know what it means to see nothing but brown, and when you spy a patch of grass you know that somebody's paying dear for such vanity. Back in the nineties the houses stood apart like scattered bones in the waste. Still do mostly, though new structures rise up now like teeth through flesh.\n\nThe place grows citified day by day but that's the way of all things now. Folk are friendly enough but like anywhere there's good and there's bad and there's those that don't know which they are. My patch is ringed with old folks, quiet and decent enough. The stores are all chains, Food for Less and Smart and Final standing like concrete sentinels. Ain't no fancy markets here. You want that kind of thing you got to travel.\n\nConstruction rules these parts. Men with hammers and steel raising frames against the sky. Too much empty space calling out to be filled though that thought carries its own kind of dread. Left the big city behind and ain't keen to see it follow me here. I'm in construction myself, hanging drywall and T-bar, my hands knowing the work like they know their own shape.\n\nThe animals though. That's what makes this place. They was here first and they know it. Desert creatures moving through their own world like they was reading from some ancient script. Lizards and bugs carrying on their own wars and treaties while we watch from our windows. My three young ones chase these creatures with the dedication of scientists, their small hands reaching out toward mystery.\n\nThe county fair comes round once a year like some traveling carnival of dreams. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like God's own frosting. Down below the Victor Valley Museum holds its bones and artifacts, telling stories of what was and what might have been. Native peoples left their mark here, their ghost stories still echoing across the waste. This high desert holds its secrets close, revealing them only to those patient enough to wait, to watch, to listen to what the wind's been trying to tell us all along.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete plain, dormitories rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. This here aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of. No white picket fences or cookie-cutter homes with manicured lawns. This here's my home all the same.\n\nThe buildings stand sentinel, three breeds of dwelling each with their own purpose ordained by some nameless architect long dead. The apartments squat low against the ground, two stories high and filled with the breath and movement of twenty souls give or take. Then there's the houses proper, scattered like dice across the grounds, mostly filled with them that used to walk these halls in years past. But it's the dormitories that tower above all else, great concrete beehives housing hundreds, each cell containing two bodies sharing the same air, same walls, same destiny.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds walking the same paths worn smooth by countless feet before them. The old ones, the professors and such, they keep to them houses dotted bout the grounds. The young ones, fresh-faced and raw, they fill them dormitories like cattle in pens. The ones in between, they take to them apartments like some middle ground between youth and wisdom.\n\nGot stores here too, though not like what you'd find in town proper. Places to eat, places to buy books and clothes with the school's mark on em like some tribal insignia. And there's this park, kept clean by some unspoken covenant between all them that call this place home. A green space where all kinds gather, where the borders between professor and student blur like heat waves rising off summer asphalt.\n\nThis here's my neighborhood, strange as it might seem to them living in proper towns. But it's got its own heartbeat, its own rules, its own way of being. And that's something true as sunrise.",
            "Aint no sidewalks here. The world slopes down and away like some great tilted plate and the house stands alone atop the highest rise where runners come daily to test themselves against the grade. They call it the workout hill. People walk in the road for there aint nowhere else to walk and the pavement is broke and scarred like the face of some ancient warrior. The wires hang slack between their poles, twisted and spliced and mended time and again by storms that rake the coast. Everywhere the evergreens rise up dark and brooding but folk here hate them, cut them down with a vengeance for blocking their view of the water. They build their houses tall with walls of glass that peer out across the bay like lidless eyes, each trying to outreach its neighbor.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns like molten copper but mostly the sky stays gray and the clouds hang low and everything that dont move grows a coat of green fur. Moss claims whatever it can. Left my truck sitting a month and found it transformed to something prehistoric and verdant. Three hours with a scraper to bring the metal back to light.\n\nThe old ones live here mostly. Retired folk. Where you might expect children you find dogs running loose and wild, pushing through open doors like they own the place. Found one in my parlor once, staring at me like I was the intruder. The rabbits too have claimed this land, great fat ones that dig up gardens until my cats find them. Birds wheel overhead - tiny things mostly, but sometimes an eagle riding the thermals until the crows drive it off like they was protecting their own piece of sky.\n\nDown the hill where the land meets the water there's places that serve up whatever the bay gives them that day. No proper beach but rocks enough to throw, watching them vanish into the gray water. The far shore sits like a dark wall through the mist, close enough to mock but too far to touch.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some sprawling beast in Brooklyn's belly, its streets a maze of concrete and steel that any fool with a metrocard could find. The trains come and go like metal serpents beneath the earth, carrying the masses in their steel bellies. Urban it was, yes, urban as any place could be in this city of endless windows and hard angles.\n\nThe Asians had come. Twenty years now they'd been coming, setting up their shops like territory markers, one after another after another until you couldn't walk a block without seeing their signs in characters that looked like birds taking flight. Markets and laundries mostly. Good places. Clean places. The people knew it too, knew the worth of fresh fish and vegetables that didn't cost a week's wages. Where I stood you could throw a stone and hit four such markets, though there wasn't any call to do such a thing.\n\nThe place wasn't all Asian though. It was a patchwork of souls, immigrants and their children and their children's children, all of them carrying their histories like invisible weights. The park stood renovated and gleaming, a testament to some bureaucrat's promise kept. Basketball courts stretched out like dominoes, soccer fields lay green and waiting, handball courts stood silent until the next game. Children's laughter echoed off the water fountains in summer, all colors and creeds mixing like watercolors in the rain.\n\nNo towers here. No glass monuments to corporate greed. Just homes stacked two deep, families living above families, and the occasional co-op rising like a concrete tombstone. The people were good enough but the noise lived in your bones. Cars would pass with their music bleeding through windows, engines screaming like wounded animals in the dark hours.\n\nNight brought its own rules. Safe enough they said but safety was a thin blanket that could tear. Violence lived here too, in the shadows between streetlights. Thieves took packages from doorsteps like coyotes stealing eggs from nests. Dogs left their marks on sidewalks despite the city's laws, their owners' negligence a testament to man's indifference to man. Every morning the evidence lay there, waiting for an unwary step, like little landmines of urban living.",
            "First thing about Portland Oregon is what weird means and you best understand that before anything else. There's words painted on the back wall of some establishment that serves pizza and music and flesh and liquor and maybe half of what goes on there aint strictly legal but the words say Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the darkness. Some folk say it's a remembrance of older times when the city was cheaper and stranger and bred peculiar tribes in its rainswept streets. Others hear it like a calling, like come to this place where your strangeness will be blessed instead of cursed.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their clean clothes and their condominium towers rise like concrete prophets against the grey sky but the weird abides. Not that weird means kind exactly but it means tolerant of things that most places would turn away. We got our Walmarts same as anywhere and our Chinese goods and our fights about politics but somehow it's different here. Like God took normal and twisted it sideways and that's what we got.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that would shame a sunset and gardens grow wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers mixing like old friends. And there's the free boxes. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass by in human form. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes stranger things. Magic things. Things that find the right person at the right time like they was meant to.\n\nThat's Portland to me though I'm just one kind of strange in an ocean of strange. Some folks wouldn't touch those sidewalk treasures with a ten foot pole but they'll do yoga with goats or scream themselves hoarse at soccer matches and that's their kind of weird. We're all chasing something here, dreams or ghosts or just the bottom of a whiskey glass.\n\nThe rain comes constant most months, grey and eternal as time itself, and it breeds darkness in some souls. We got our addicts and our crazy folk and our homeless camps spread out like refugee settlements from some war nobody remembers fighting. The city tries to help but help aint ever enough and the people who still got homes swing between charity and rage like a pendulum. In that we're just like anywhere else. Just normal folk trying to figure out what to do with all our broken pieces.",
            "They stand in the north like ancient gods. Bearing witness. Patient and cruel in their permanence. The mountains. No matter what tribulations of man pass beneath them they remain. Unmoved. Unchanged. When the mind grows weary with the tasks of living they command attention like some dark covenant writ in stone and earth and there is no choice but to look upon them and draw what strength remains in their presence.\n\nI came here young. A student. The university buildings stood ornate and proper but it was the mountains that held dominion over all. The town below stretched out like some dying creature, its cafes and shops the last breaths of civilization before the wild. Students haunted these places like restless ghosts, their minds clouded with coffee and desperation, seeking answers in books that held none. Further on lay the old downtown with its weathered brick facades. A false promise of urbanity. The library marked some invisible boundary between this pretense and the quiet beyond. As if god himself had drawn a line in chalk and dared not cross it.\n\nMemories collect in such places like detritus after a flood. Some precious, some bitter. The rusted playground equipment stands sentinel over countless midnight wanderings. The theater with its gaudy lights bears witness to brief moments of joy. But it is the ponds that hold the darkest hours. Where tears fall silent in the small hours while creatures crawl and swim about their meaningless lives, ignorant of human suffering. Standing there in those moments the question of purpose hangs heavy as a noose.\n\nWalking north past suburban houses that squat like toads in their perfect rows. The sun breaks over palm trees and paints the sky in colors that have no names. And there they stand. As they have always stood. As they will always stand. The mountains. Their peaks pierce the morning haze like knives and speak without speaking of endurance. Of persistence. Of the terrible burden of continuing on.",
            "You'd pass it by and think nothing of it. Nothing at all. Just another strip of commerce dying slow in the southern heat behind which people made their homes whether they ought to or not. Past the hollow shell of what was once a Whole Foods and beyond the hotels that stand near empty save summer's brief fever dream of reunions and gatherings, there they lived. Row on row of apartments lined up like children's toys forgotten in the dust. God's own dioramas of life and living.\n\nThe first block carried stories dark as pitch in the evening news but appearances deceive and truth hides in shadow. Beyond lay something else entirely. Something the townsfolk knew nothing of, cared nothing for. Across the way stood the college, squat and institutional, where students shuffled in bearing paper cups of coffee like votive offerings to some modernday deity of education. Iron gates keened their morning song while traffic built and drivers cursed the dawdling scholars before them.\n\nThe road met its end at another, a T-shaped communion of asphalt where the rehabilitation center faced down the park across the way. Ceiling fans turned lazy circles in the thick summer air while the broken and healing watched life pass by from rocking chairs. Children moved like wild things through the grass, their bodies describing geometries of youth while bees performed their ancient dance among the roadside flowers. The elderly walked their dogs and cast dark looks at boys on wheeled boards, nodding proper-like to clusters of girls who spoke in whispers of boys and digital fame.\n\nStrip mall life carried on beside them. A sushi place that time forgot. A pool supply store. Nail salon wedged between like an afterthought. Modern convenience stacked and ordered, everything at hand. The frozen yogurt place drew them in, those young ones with their boards and their vapor clouds, thinking themselves immortal in the weight of summer air. This was America distilled, the south preserved in amber, where time moved slow as molasses and change came gentle as a whisper, if it came at all.",
            "The houses stand like tired sentinels. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still in their weathered watch. Small plots of earth before them where dreams once grew green and verdant now lay fallow and forgotten. Driveways narrow and cracked lead to homes that whisper of times past when suburban living was the covenant of american prosperity. That dream now recedes like evening tide leaving behind only shells of what once was. Yet the neighborhood persists. It calls out with voice ancient and true to those who would listen that all is not lost, that some fragment of that dream yet lives in the hearts of those who remain.\n\nThe people walk more slowly now. Their eyes cast down at yards gone wild where once pride bloomed in careful rows. Cars still rest in drives, their metal skin oxidized and weeping. Children play in streets wide as salvation, their world bounded by the horizon of youth and innocence. The school rises from concrete like some primitive godhouse, ninety years of hopes and futures stored in its brick belly. Churches stand empty save for dust and memory while basketball rings sing metallic hymns to those who still worship there.\n\nEach house different yet bound in common suffering. The market, Super A, squats beneath a sun-bleached sign, run by Yemeni folk who stand apart in their solitude among the mostly black residents. Wide streets become impromptu fields where young boys play at football, scattering like starlings when cars approach. Old folk speak of times when names were known and faces familiar, their words carrying the weight of generations.\n\nWhere once stood a temple to eastern combat arts now stands a dispensary of modern medicines, hollywood dreams replaced by chemical comfort. The cinema remains, a refuge for the old who find solace in flickering shadows of better days, while young ones pass it by like mourners at a stranger's grave. The expressway runs past but does not touch this place, kept at bay by elders who saw in its concrete arteries the death of something precious and unnamed. They build new schools now and speak of mascots, as if such tokens might ward off the future that comes for them all, inexorable as night.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, its streets a twisted maze of commerce and dwelling places strewn about like bones scattered by some ancient beast. Buildings rise and fall in their purpose, some for living and some for trade, and none seeming to care much for the order of things. Eateries spring up like weeds after rain, and shops both corporate and small huddle together in the shadow of progress. The small ones, they persist somehow, clinging to life along the streets that wind past neighborhoods that aint never known true quiet, not with the world pressing in all around.\n\nParks dot the landscape like green wounds in the concrete, where children still play and their mothers watch with tired eyes. The people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. The queers and the Jews and the Russians all staked their claims, carved out their territories in this godless expanse. Further out lie the other tribes - the Koreans, the Chinese, the Armenians - each with their own small kingdoms in the urban waste, though none but ten miles distant as the crow flies.\n\nBut distance here is measured in time and suffering. Ten miles might mean two hours of your life, lost to the endless river of machines that choke the streets. Nobody walks. They cant. Or they wont. The city's too big, too mean for that. So the cars multiply like a plague and there aint nowhere to put them all. And still they build, raising towers of glass and steel to house more souls, more vehicles, more despair. The old residents watch and curse under their breath, knowing what's coming.\n\nHouses stand defiant against the apartment blocks, some big, some small, some split in two like conjoined twins. They all tell different stories of different lives, different dreams. The people living in them, they're strangers to each other now. Time was when children played in streets and knew their neighbors' names. Those days are gone, buried under the weight of progress and indifference, like so much else in this concrete wilderness.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stood like soldiers in endless formation clear to the horizon. This is what there is, he said. He knew the emptiness would strike her deep, her being from places where folk lived stacked upon folk and markets stood walking distance from any door. She'd never seen such vastness laid bare before her eyes.\n\nThe fields of corn stretched eternal and watching her face he told her tales of his youth in rural Ohio and she knew him then as she hadnt before. The road they followed, just two lanes of crumbling asphalt, led past a waterlogged quarry to where the houses stood. Brick and stucco dwellings each claiming its half acre of manicured earth, gardens tended with religious devotion. Spring brought forth flowers planted by careful hands while the native trees marked time's passage with their changing colors.\n\nMercedes automobiles gleamed in driveways like alien artifacts, their surfaces reflecting midday sun after ritual washing. The Korean, old doc they called him, could be found most days astride his green John Deere, singing above the machines drone while he cut patterns in the grass. Folk smiled at his ways but knew him for what he was - a good man with stories etched deep in his weathered face. Time had taken its toll on his mind but he persisted, a fixture like the trees themselves.\n\nThe house stood grey against the sky. Geese patrolled the yard while the terrier gave chase, an endless ritual neither side meant to conclude. Behind lay the stream that fed the quarry, its voice mixing with bullfrog song and distant cattle lowing across the fields. Past the wooden bridge they'd built by hand lay wilderness untamed - trees and herbs and flowers that grew by natures will alone. This was where childhood lived.\n\nWinter came harsh and beautiful both. The green world died to white emptiness, trees stripped to bone against grey skies. Snow transformed the land overnight into something foreign and pure. His sister's angels lay pressed in drifts while snowmen stood sentinel. They'd wage their wars then, him and his sister, behind fortifications of packed snow reinforced with dead branches. They'd launch their frozen projectiles in battles that meant everything and nothing, playing at war in a world where time hadnt yet shown its teeth."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

No chain stores with their bright lights and empty promises. Everything's a drive. Everything's a journey.\n\nThe water surrounds us like God's own embrace. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of em blue as judgment day. Everywhere you turn there's water waitin to baptize your feet in its cold mercy.\n\nThe houses stand like congregants at an old time revival, each one different, each one with its own history written in wood and nail and time. Some got new faces, some wear their age like medals. Most got these basements you can see from the road, like the earth opened up and swallowed part of em whole. The aluminum siding's gone gray and weary on many, weathered by seasons uncounted. Colors everywhere. Like God himself got drunk on paint one day and threw it all across the neighborhood.\n\nYards stretch out like promises. Kids' dreams scattered across em in the shape of trampolines and swing sets. Gardens grow where hope takes root. Fences mark the boundaries where folks keep their animals, keep their lives contained.\n\nThese are working people's homes. The kind of folk who wear their labor like skin and raise their young with calloused hands. Children run wild in the streets like scattered birds. Dogs walk their people. Bikes spin their wheels in the dying light. Neighbors know each other's shadows. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear.\n\nThe lawns stay trimmed like Sunday haircuts. No dead leaves permitted to rest. Everything maintained, everything in its place, like the order might keep chaos at bay. Ain't beautiful in the way fancy folks think of beautiful, but it's got something better. Got truth. Got peace.\n\nThe law sits close by, sheriff and jail both, like old testament prophets watching over their flock. The health department. The recycling center where folks bring their discarded dreams. Baseball fields echo with voices calling out names like prayers into the evening air. Small planes drone overhead like mechanical angels, coming and going from the airport that sits like a promise of escape.\n\nIce cream's within walking distance. Downtown too, if your legs got the faith. Kids can ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks of freedom stretched out before them. This here's a good place. A true place. The kind of place where America still dreams its old dreams and believes in em too.",
            "They built it all the same. Row after row of houses like children's blocks laid out by some vast and methodical hand. The HOA's presence hung over it all like a wraith, unseen but felt in every trimmed blade and painted shutter. Houses stood shoulder to shoulder, each with its measured plot of grass and scattered stone, driveways short as winter days. Trees grew where they were told, stunted things that gave no shade. Two-car garages lined up like grave markers.\n\nThe roads stretched out black and perfect, untouched by the violence of frost or neglect. No potholes marred the surface, as if decay itself had been legislated away. Most dwellings squatted low to the earth but some rose up two stories, reaching toward something they'd never grasp. The mailboxes stood in steel congregations at the street's end, uniform and cold, locked away from thieves and chaos. Package lockers gaped like empty mouths.\n\nThe neighborhood sat at the city's edge where civilization met wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land spread out vast and empty, punctuated by community pools behind their iron gates, walking trails that wound like asphalt serpents through the scrubland. Folk walked their dogs there or wandered alone in the gloaming. You could run till your legs gave out and never leave these borders.\n\nMostly it was the old ones who lived here. Retirees who'd come to die in peace, watching from behind their windows. Some younger souls mixed in, professionals with their briefcases and pressed shirts, but they were fewer. The city beyond sprawled large but carried itself like a small town, one mall standing sentinel over commerce. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to the stores - high-end markets with their organic promises, discount shops with their fluorescent desperation.\n\nIt was safe here. That's what they all said. Safe and maintained and proper. The pools gleamed blue in summer sun, the trails stretched out empty and waiting. Everything a body could want, they said, just a short drive away. But at night, when the sun bled out behind the identical rooflines, something else stirred in the spaces between the sameness, something that remembered what this land had been before the concrete came.",
            "First I heard tell of this place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through wire and static like old ghosts. Strange thing. The units here they cost dear, thousand dollars or more each month gone to wind and nobody I knew had heard such tales. Maybe its the weight of living bears down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper, friends trying to hold together what little they got. We learned to scrape by. Years teach you to love the smell of other peoples castoffs, the musty sweetness of old toys and clothes wrapped in paper, mothballs like little white deaths. Your nose forgets in time. Maybe its the cigarettes or maybe the world just wears you down till you dont notice no more. But that fleamarket smell it gets in deep. Adulthood smells like magazines gone yellow stacked on piano keys nobody plays no more. Gets in the leather and wont wash out.\n\nThree secondhand stores walking distance. Start at the far end you can hit two charity shops, library with its paper smell, man selling rare books, shop full of curiosities. Downtown packed tight with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like water but step inside them shops and the world goes quiet as a grave. Good place to lose yourself. Every year more comes, more metal more flesh. They call it developing. Some big internet empire made its home here, growing pains they say. Makes me think on New York. Everybody got their own heading, nobody asks nothing of nobody. You can keep to yourself, quiet-like, independent, and folks let you be. Aint like down South where caring means getting in folks business. Here you stay in your shell long as you want and the city just rolls past like the ocean we got.\n\nPlace stays alive though. Got piano player next door, two trying to be singers up above. Less strangers more like family now. We come together when needs must, mark the birthdays and the funerals, help each other best we can. Lucky maybe. Like my neighbors well enough and they treat me fair. I mind my mess and share my food, they do the same. Pass mail back and forth like peace offerings. Good to see them and reckon they feel same about me. Living in this big cold machine of glass and steel but its them makes me think I aint ruined nothing after all.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something else entirely. Our quarter sits on the eastern edge where the houses stand weathered and bent like old men waiting. Not rich folk here. Most rent. Some own but all scratch out their days in dwellings worth less than the memories they hold.\n\nThe people here they nod and speak when you pass. Good people mostly. Violence visits sometimes like an unwelcome relative that won't stay gone. Shots ring out in the night. Bodies fall. The neighbors boy went down outside MacGruder's Bar last spring. Just went down and didn't get up again. We've been lucky. Lost nothing save what we were foolish enough to leave on the porch come nightfall.\n\nThe poison that's taken half the country hasn't spared us neither. Fentanyl's got its hooks in deep. Bodies stack up like cordwood in winter. Town's got places for them that want help. Training for them that want to save someone. Sometimes it works. Mostly it don't.\n\nYet there's good here too. The school where my boy goes stands like a fortress against the darkness. Teachers there treat him right despite his differences. No meanness follows him through those halls. The women of the PTO work like ants building community one event at a time. Every child eats free cause hunger don't care what side of town you're from.\n\nThe council men they pour money into the center of town like water into sand. New roads. Parks with fresh paint. Gardens where weeds once stood. But the east side sees none of it. Money flows west where the shoppers go and the cars pass through. East side folks watch and wait and talk about injustice in low voices.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house ain't much but it holds us. Keeps the rain out. Keeps us warm. Stores sell what we need. People know us. Sometimes at night I think about leaving but I know we won't. Some places get in your blood like a fever and won't let go. This is such a place.",
            "The hill rises like some ancient altar, crowned with buildings that remember. Seven stories up I dwell, the old theater watching silent across the way, and down below there's this place where folk gather when the summer heat bleeds into night, a bar with machines that ping and flash and draw the masses like moths to flame. They queue there, patient in the thick June air, July air, waiting for their turn at whatever salvation lies within.\n\nUphill the park sprawls vast and concrete-bound, its steps cut deep into walls that hold no memory. Winter brings the dispossessed, their canvas homes lined like soldiers' graves along the walks and stairs. Rain comes more than snow, brutal and cold, driving them together for warmth in the city's heart rather than out where the wild things grow. They walk or ride to wash where they can, the family center standing lone sentinel in miles of urban waste.\n\nBut it aint the old buildings that make this place, though they stand proud enough, scattered cross the hills that tumble oceanward. It's the people carry the real history here. Hilltop, they called it, when blood ran in gutters and gang wars painted these streets red. Federal men came through like God's own wrath, DEA badges glinting like false stars. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like me who came after.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though others still name it rough country. White folk, they say, best clear out after dark. But that's old poison talking, the kind that seeps through generations like bad water through limestone. Maybe it's my skin, dark enough to pass, or maybe Hilltop sees what's truly in a soul. These streets know the weight of racism, know how fear breeds in ignorance like rats in walls, even here in this supposed melting pot paradise.\n\nThis much I know true: Hilltop's got my bones now. These night streets pulse with life, and strangers offer warmth before threat. Laundry women keep doors open past closing just to shelter a charging phone, and concrete storefronts become sanctuaries. Even when I try to fade into shadow, someone always sees. They press wrinkled bills into palms and speak of beauty and worth like prophets of some new religion. This is home, and it holds its own terrible grace.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade, the houses standing like sentinels in the gathering dusk. Strange and lonesome at first until I found kinship with two boys who lived along that same stretch of asphalt. They're gone now but the memories remain like shadows cast by a setting sun. The old neighbors persist, their faces weathered by time but unchanged in their routines.\n\nThe houses rise two stories tall, cookie-cutter monuments to suburban dreams. Children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and perfectly trimmed hedges. Most days the quiet settles like dust. The people here keep to themselves except in times of need, a silent covenant between strangers sharing the same patch of earth. Packages appear and remain untouched on porches, a testament to some lingering trust in human nature.\n\nThe park lies just beyond, a small stretch of green where memories collect like fallen leaves. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked courts where we played our games, the concrete holding stories of triumph and blood. One day my nose burst red against someone's elbow in a football game, but such wounds heal and good memories outweigh the bad like light outweighs shadow. Now I watch my cousin's children chase their own joy there, their small bodies arcing through space on swing sets, their excitement pure and uncontained.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within walking distance. Though nowadays people summon their meals through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints stand on every corner like modern-day trading posts. The stores stock everything a body might need, from medicine to groceries to spices from the old country. Even got an Indian market where the air hangs heavy with cardamom and cumin.\n\nI've come to know this place like the back of my hand, grateful for its quiet dignity when I read tales of neighborhood wars and porch pirates in other places. Some folks don't know how good they got it till they see how bad it could be.",
            "The college stands near where I lay my head. Not far. Walking distance. Buildings rise up like concrete monoliths, weathered and old, their faces worn by time and indifference. Bars and eateries dot the streets between, some cheaper than others, some renamed in vain attempts at reinvention. The new one charges more but the spirits flow just the same.\n\nPeople here exist in two tribes: the students with their books and dreams, and the poor with their burdens. Children too, countless, drawn by the elementary school that squats beyond the asphalt. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how it'll stay. They fill the halls with sweet smoke and management's response was to mount some perfumed contraption across their door. A joke told in plastic and chemicals.\n\nThe buildings stand like tired sentinels. Some wear new faces inside their old bones. Down the way they've raised new apartments, built quick and cheap, charging gold for copper. A sin against honest architecture but they know the students will come. They always come.\n\nThere's a place serves food on paper plates. Microwave hum their constant prayer. Gas station across the way. Bad place to work they say. City money brought new concrete though. Wide sidewalks. Grass growing where there wasn't before. Nature tamed and parceled.\n\nTrees shelter my building like ancient guardians. Some fell to the saw, their stumps testament to their last stand. More trees here than down the road where the light hits harder. Behind us lies 43rd street, meaner somehow. Broken sidewalks like a mouthful of bad teeth. Buildings trying to hide their shame behind green curtains of leaves. Violence visits there more often, though it knows no boundaries. Crosses the street sometimes to where the wanderers live in their temporary homes.\n\nBut this place suits me well enough. Money flows easier here and the necessities of life stand close. The university and its promise remains within reach, and the buses come regular as heartbeats, carrying people to store and city alike. Some might call it home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all but rather houses strung along the curved road like beads on some great necklace. Folk here they know each other mostly. They gather in the gloaming at the end of drives not chosen but found and speak of things that matter little while their young ones mark the concrete with chalk or chase kites against the dimming sky. Like some forgotten time. Like the world aint gone mad with its screens and circuits and endless hum of progress.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees stand ancient witness while clouds white as bone drift across the blue vault above. But the weather it turns cruel sometimes. Last night the sirens wailed their banshee song and we all knew what it meant. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever precious things I could gather while the big one paced and barked at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles scattered across the earth. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cool, temperature falling like a stone from ninety-two to seventy-five. The ice melted where it struck leaving ghost marks on the pavement.\n\nThen the sun broke through and rain fell still and there appeared above us twin arcs of color like some covenant with the sky. Captured it with the camera though such things aint meant for keeping. People emerged slow from their shelters like creatures after flood, and life took up its rhythm again. Women calling children home to supper.\n\nThis place it speaks different from New Hampshire. Got its own tongue, soft and sweet as honey. The houses mirror each other outside but inside they're as different as the folk who dwell in them. Behind my place theres a field stretches down to a pond where no one swims and sometimes deer step quiet in the dawn while bullfrogs sing their ancient songs. Charlotte lies forty minutes distant but here the roosters still announce the morning and somewhere in the gathering dark a donkey brays his lonesome prayer. Like some village lost to time, found again in this corner of North Carolina. A place that still remembers what it means to be a place.",
            "Ten years now. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. First light of Stockbridge felt wrong after Riverdale, like wearing someone else's skin. Tears came unbidden. Mother and father, they wanted better. Better schools, better houses, better lives for their young. Away from what folk called the ghetto though such words mean little to children who know only home.\n\nTime passes like water through fingers. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange except for Glen and Dennis who lived adjacent. Good people. Family almost, if blood weren't the judge of such things. Remember Glen's wedding clear as yesterday's sun. Him getting married again, wife in white. Veda, they called her. She threw that white garter and somehow it found my hand though the flowers went elsewhere. We danced. All of us. Marsharii, Glen's daughter, she danced too. Ain't seen her since. World takes people where it will.\n\nThe streets here wind like serpents but technology guides now where feet once wandered blind. Kason and Curtis, we'd game together. Young men killing time like it was endless. The park became sanctuary. Something holy in the quiet there. Brought sticks from the hardware store, practice balance like them eastern warriors. Wooden sword too sometimes. Basketball court and tennis lanes lay empty now but memory serves up old games. Father and Mr. Graves teaching tennis, working us till sweat ran rivers. Joy in the work though. Always joy.\n\nNeighborhood holds stories like earth holds bones. Some rise up, others stay buried. But like them preachers say, best is yet to come. Though who can say what best means in a world that turns regardless of our wishes.",
            "The town dont stand apart from any other in South Carolina but it carries the weight of peaches on its back like some ancient burden. Johnston they call it. Peach Capital of the World emblazoned on a sign weathered and proud against the sky. The land stretches vast and empty save for the peach trees standing like sentinels in ordered rows or the black cattle that dot the fields like moving shadows.\n\nHouses stand apart from one another like strangers at a wake. Metal roofs gleam under the merciless southern sun or gray shingles fade like old memories. They squat back from the road behind fields where beasts graze and crops rise from the red earth. The town proper hangs suspended around a single stoplight, its red eye blinking at the crossroads where commerce gatheres like vultures at a carcass.\n\nThree places serve what passes for sustenance: the Chinese family at Hong Kong, their faces worn smooth like river stones, the Mexicans at their Fiesta, and Gary's where burgers slide across greased counters. The pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford, deals in medicines and cherry cola, each equally addictive to the locals. IGA stands alone, a grocery outpost charging siege prices while the townfolk flee to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville like refugees seeking sanctuary.\n\nDollar General rules this kingdom of small needs, its aisles always full, a bazaar of plastic and necessity. The furniture woman tends her store of possibilities like a garden, her two movers strong as oxen carrying couches across thresholds. Next door they wash dogs at Clark's, soap and water bringing order to chaos.\n\nThe doctors tend to man and beast in separate buildings on the outskirts, like some biblical separation. Children learn their letters at Johnston Elementary until fifth grade sends them away like young exiles to the next town over. They speak of parks to come, two and a half acres of manufactured pleasure, but for now the land remains raw and untamed.\n\nNo picture shows, no bowling alleys, no gathering places where youth might congregate like starlings on a wire. Just earth and sky and peach trees and cattle, a town so small you might pass through it between heartbeats, like a dream half-remembered in the morning light.",
            "We live where the asphalt runs between two highways in the southern part of Tennessee, the road black and endless and carrying the burden of too many strangers passing through. The houses stand like tired sentinels, their occupants long familiar to us now, their faces worn by time and weather and the daily rituals that bind them to this place. They move about their yards like penitents, raking leaves that fall eternal from ancient trees that stood here before any of us drew breath.\n\nThe house sits at the corner where we watch the world pass. Four souls dwell within. Me and the wife and two girls, eleven and fourteen, their youth still unmarked by time. We know the machines that pass, their engines humming familiar songs, and when strange metal beasts prowl our streets we mark them well, our eyes following their passage like wary predators.\n\nWinter brings children to the hill on the side street, their sleds cutting dark paths in virgin snow. But winters grow weak now, mere shadows of seasons past, and fall stretches long and dark across the calendar like a dying man's shadow. The mowers drone from spring until the dying time of October, their mechanical voices a chorus that echoes through the trees that crowd our lots like wooden armies.\n\nThe garage stands rear-ward, dark and waiting. When I work there the doors yawn open like great metal maws and I can taste the neighborhood on my tongue. Smell the smoke from burning leaves that marks the death of summer. Watch the barbecue smoke rise from back decks like signals from ancient tribes. Holiday times bring strange cars and foreign faces, metal and flesh crowding the streets like refugees from some distant war.\n\nWe rarely use the front door. It stands like a forgotten sentinel, its knock a rare herald of the outside world trying to breach our sanctuary. The traffic flows endless past our corner, a river of metal and exhaust that mars what might otherwise be perfect. But this is our place and we abide here, watching the seasons turn and the leaves fall and the children grow beneath these ancient trees that remember more than any of us ever will.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast brown altar, dirt and more dirt reaching toward mountains that stand ancient and indifferent. A man who ain't lived here don't know what it means to see nothing but brown, and when you spy a patch of grass you know that somebody's paying dear for such vanity. Back in the nineties the houses stood apart like scattered bones in the waste. Still do mostly, though new structures rise up now like teeth through flesh.\n\nThe place grows citified day by day but that's the way of all things now. Folk are friendly enough but like anywhere there's good and there's bad and there's those that don't know which they are. My patch is ringed with old folks, quiet and decent enough. The stores are all chains, Food for Less and Smart and Final standing like concrete sentinels. Ain't no fancy markets here. You want that kind of thing you got to travel.\n\nConstruction rules these parts. Men with hammers and steel raising frames against the sky. Too much empty space calling out to be filled though that thought carries its own kind of dread. Left the big city behind and ain't keen to see it follow me here. I'm in construction myself, hanging drywall and T-bar, my hands knowing the work like they know their own shape.\n\nThe animals though. That's what makes this place. They was here first and they know it. Desert creatures moving through their own world like they was reading from some ancient script. Lizards and bugs carrying on their own wars and treaties while we watch from our windows. My three young ones chase these creatures with the dedication of scientists, their small hands reaching out toward mystery.\n\nThe county fair comes round once a year like some traveling carnival of dreams. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like God's own frosting. Down below the Victor Valley Museum holds its bones and artifacts, telling stories of what was and what might have been. Native peoples left their mark here, their ghost stories still echoing across the waste. This high desert holds its secrets close, revealing them only to those patient enough to wait, to watch, to listen to what the wind's been trying to tell us all along.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete plain, dormitories rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. This here aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of. No white picket fences or cookie-cutter homes with manicured lawns. This here's my home all the same.\n\nThe buildings stand sentinel, three breeds of dwelling each with their own purpose ordained by some nameless architect long dead. The apartments squat low against the ground, two stories high and filled with the breath and movement of twenty souls give or take. Then there's the houses proper, scattered like dice across the grounds, mostly filled with them that used to walk these halls in years past. But it's the dormitories that tower above all else, great concrete beehives housing hundreds, each cell containing two bodies sharing the same air, same walls, same destiny.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds walking the same paths worn smooth by countless feet before them. The old ones, the professors and such, they keep to them houses dotted bout the grounds. The young ones, fresh-faced and raw, they fill them dormitories like cattle in pens. The ones in between, they take to them apartments like some middle ground between youth and wisdom.\n\nGot stores here too, though not like what you'd find in town proper. Places to eat, places to buy books and clothes with the school's mark on em like some tribal insignia. And there's this park, kept clean by some unspoken covenant between all them that call this place home. A green space where all kinds gather, where the borders between professor and student blur like heat waves rising off summer asphalt.\n\nThis here's my neighborhood, strange as it might seem to them living in proper towns. But it's got its own heartbeat, its own rules, its own way of being. And that's something true as sunrise.",
            "Aint no sidewalks here. The world slopes down and away like some great tilted plate and the house stands alone atop the highest rise where runners come daily to test themselves against the grade. They call it the workout hill. People walk in the road for there aint nowhere else to walk and the pavement is broke and scarred like the face of some ancient warrior. The wires hang slack between their poles, twisted and spliced and mended time and again by storms that rake the coast. Everywhere the evergreens rise up dark and brooding but folk here hate them, cut them down with a vengeance for blocking their view of the water. They build their houses tall with walls of glass that peer out across the bay like lidless eyes, each trying to outreach its neighbor.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns like molten copper but mostly the sky stays gray and the clouds hang low and everything that dont move grows a coat of green fur. Moss claims whatever it can. Left my truck sitting a month and found it transformed to something prehistoric and verdant. Three hours with a scraper to bring the metal back to light.\n\nThe old ones live here mostly. Retired folk. Where you might expect children you find dogs running loose and wild, pushing through open doors like they own the place. Found one in my parlor once, staring at me like I was the intruder. The rabbits too have claimed this land, great fat ones that dig up gardens until my cats find them. Birds wheel overhead - tiny things mostly, but sometimes an eagle riding the thermals until the crows drive it off like they was protecting their own piece of sky.\n\nDown the hill where the land meets the water there's places that serve up whatever the bay gives them that day. No proper beach but rocks enough to throw, watching them vanish into the gray water. The far shore sits like a dark wall through the mist, close enough to mock but too far to touch.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some sprawling beast in Brooklyn's belly, its streets a maze of concrete and steel that any fool with a metrocard could find. The trains come and go like metal serpents beneath the earth, carrying the masses in their steel bellies. Urban it was, yes, urban as any place could be in this city of endless windows and hard angles.\n\nThe Asians had come. Twenty years now they'd been coming, setting up their shops like territory markers, one after another after another until you couldn't walk a block without seeing their signs in characters that looked like birds taking flight. Markets and laundries mostly. Good places. Clean places. The people knew it too, knew the worth of fresh fish and vegetables that didn't cost a week's wages. Where I stood you could throw a stone and hit four such markets, though there wasn't any call to do such a thing.\n\nThe place wasn't all Asian though. It was a patchwork of souls, immigrants and their children and their children's children, all of them carrying their histories like invisible weights. The park stood renovated and gleaming, a testament to some bureaucrat's promise kept. Basketball courts stretched out like dominoes, soccer fields lay green and waiting, handball courts stood silent until the next game. Children's laughter echoed off the water fountains in summer, all colors and creeds mixing like watercolors in the rain.\n\nNo towers here. No glass monuments to corporate greed. Just homes stacked two deep, families living above families, and the occasional co-op rising like a concrete tombstone. The people were good enough but the noise lived in your bones. Cars would pass with their music bleeding through windows, engines screaming like wounded animals in the dark hours.\n\nNight brought its own rules. Safe enough they said but safety was a thin blanket that could tear. Violence lived here too, in the shadows between streetlights. Thieves took packages from doorsteps like coyotes stealing eggs from nests. Dogs left their marks on sidewalks despite the city's laws, their owners' negligence a testament to man's indifference to man. Every morning the evidence lay there, waiting for an unwary step, like little landmines of urban living.",
            "First thing about Portland Oregon is what weird means and you best understand that before anything else. There's words painted on the back wall of some establishment that serves pizza and music and flesh and liquor and maybe half of what goes on there aint strictly legal but the words say Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the darkness. Some folk say it's a remembrance of older times when the city was cheaper and stranger and bred peculiar tribes in its rainswept streets. Others hear it like a calling, like come to this place where your strangeness will be blessed instead of cursed.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their clean clothes and their condominium towers rise like concrete prophets against the grey sky but the weird abides. Not that weird means kind exactly but it means tolerant of things that most places would turn away. We got our Walmarts same as anywhere and our Chinese goods and our fights about politics but somehow it's different here. Like God took normal and twisted it sideways and that's what we got.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that would shame a sunset and gardens grow wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers mixing like old friends. And there's the free boxes. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass by in human form. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes stranger things. Magic things. Things that find the right person at the right time like they was meant to.\n\nThat's Portland to me though I'm just one kind of strange in an ocean of strange. Some folks wouldn't touch those sidewalk treasures with a ten foot pole but they'll do yoga with goats or scream themselves hoarse at soccer matches and that's their kind of weird. We're all chasing something here, dreams or ghosts or just the bottom of a whiskey glass.\n\nThe rain comes constant most months, grey and eternal as time itself, and it breeds darkness in some souls. We got our addicts and our crazy folk and our homeless camps spread out like refugee settlements from some war nobody remembers fighting. The city tries to help but help aint ever enough and the people who still got homes swing between charity and rage like a pendulum. In that we're just like anywhere else. Just normal folk trying to figure out what to do with all our broken pieces.",
            "They stand in the north like ancient gods. Bearing witness. Patient and cruel in their permanence. The mountains. No matter what tribulations of man pass beneath them they remain. Unmoved. Unchanged. When the mind grows weary with the tasks of living they command attention like some dark covenant writ in stone and earth and there is no choice but to look upon them and draw what strength remains in their presence.\n\nI came here young. A student. The university buildings stood ornate and proper but it was the mountains that held dominion over all. The town below stretched out like some dying creature, its cafes and shops the last breaths of civilization before the wild. Students haunted these places like restless ghosts, their minds clouded with coffee and desperation, seeking answers in books that held none. Further on lay the old downtown with its weathered brick facades. A false promise of urbanity. The library marked some invisible boundary between this pretense and the quiet beyond. As if god himself had drawn a line in chalk and dared not cross it.\n\nMemories collect in such places like detritus after a flood. Some precious, some bitter. The rusted playground equipment stands sentinel over countless midnight wanderings. The theater with its gaudy lights bears witness to brief moments of joy. But it is the ponds that hold the darkest hours. Where tears fall silent in the small hours while creatures crawl and swim about their meaningless lives, ignorant of human suffering. Standing there in those moments the question of purpose hangs heavy as a noose.\n\nWalking north past suburban houses that squat like toads in their perfect rows. The sun breaks over palm trees and paints the sky in colors that have no names. And there they stand. As they have always stood. As they will always stand. The mountains. Their peaks pierce the morning haze like knives and speak without speaking of endurance. Of persistence. Of the terrible burden of continuing on.",
            "You'd pass it by and think nothing of it. Nothing at all. Just another strip of commerce dying slow in the southern heat behind which people made their homes whether they ought to or not. Past the hollow shell of what was once a Whole Foods and beyond the hotels that stand near empty save summer's brief fever dream of reunions and gatherings, there they lived. Row on row of apartments lined up like children's toys forgotten in the dust. God's own dioramas of life and living.\n\nThe first block carried stories dark as pitch in the evening news but appearances deceive and truth hides in shadow. Beyond lay something else entirely. Something the townsfolk knew nothing of, cared nothing for. Across the way stood the college, squat and institutional, where students shuffled in bearing paper cups of coffee like votive offerings to some modernday deity of education. Iron gates keened their morning song while traffic built and drivers cursed the dawdling scholars before them.\n\nThe road met its end at another, a T-shaped communion of asphalt where the rehabilitation center faced down the park across the way. Ceiling fans turned lazy circles in the thick summer air while the broken and healing watched life pass by from rocking chairs. Children moved like wild things through the grass, their bodies describing geometries of youth while bees performed their ancient dance among the roadside flowers. The elderly walked their dogs and cast dark looks at boys on wheeled boards, nodding proper-like to clusters of girls who spoke in whispers of boys and digital fame.\n\nStrip mall life carried on beside them. A sushi place that time forgot. A pool supply store. Nail salon wedged between like an afterthought. Modern convenience stacked and ordered, everything at hand. The frozen yogurt place drew them in, those young ones with their boards and their vapor clouds, thinking themselves immortal in the weight of summer air. This was America distilled, the south preserved in amber, where time moved slow as molasses and change came gentle as a whisper, if it came at all.",
            "The houses stand like tired sentinels. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still in their weathered watch. Small plots of earth before them where dreams once grew green and verdant now lay fallow and forgotten. Driveways narrow and cracked lead to homes that whisper of times past when suburban living was the covenant of american prosperity. That dream now recedes like evening tide leaving behind only shells of what once was. Yet the neighborhood persists. It calls out with voice ancient and true to those who would listen that all is not lost, that some fragment of that dream yet lives in the hearts of those who remain.\n\nThe people walk more slowly now. Their eyes cast down at yards gone wild where once pride bloomed in careful rows. Cars still rest in drives, their metal skin oxidized and weeping. Children play in streets wide as salvation, their world bounded by the horizon of youth and innocence. The school rises from concrete like some primitive godhouse, ninety years of hopes and futures stored in its brick belly. Churches stand empty save for dust and memory while basketball rings sing metallic hymns to those who still worship there.\n\nEach house different yet bound in common suffering. The market, Super A, squats beneath a sun-bleached sign, run by Yemeni folk who stand apart in their solitude among the mostly black residents. Wide streets become impromptu fields where young boys play at football, scattering like starlings when cars approach. Old folk speak of times when names were known and faces familiar, their words carrying the weight of generations.\n\nWhere once stood a temple to eastern combat arts now stands a dispensary of modern medicines, hollywood dreams replaced by chemical comfort. The cinema remains, a refuge for the old who find solace in flickering shadows of better days, while young ones pass it by like mourners at a stranger's grave. The expressway runs past but does not touch this place, kept at bay by elders who saw in its concrete arteries the death of something precious and unnamed. They build new schools now and speak of mascots, as if such tokens might ward off the future that comes for them all, inexorable as night.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, its streets a twisted maze of commerce and dwelling places strewn about like bones scattered by some ancient beast. Buildings rise and fall in their purpose, some for living and some for trade, and none seeming to care much for the order of things. Eateries spring up like weeds after rain, and shops both corporate and small huddle together in the shadow of progress. The small ones, they persist somehow, clinging to life along the streets that wind past neighborhoods that aint never known true quiet, not with the world pressing in all around.\n\nParks dot the landscape like green wounds in the concrete, where children still play and their mothers watch with tired eyes. The people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. The queers and the Jews and the Russians all staked their claims, carved out their territories in this godless expanse. Further out lie the other tribes - the Koreans, the Chinese, the Armenians - each with their own small kingdoms in the urban waste, though none but ten miles distant as the crow flies.\n\nBut distance here is measured in time and suffering. Ten miles might mean two hours of your life, lost to the endless river of machines that choke the streets. Nobody walks. They cant. Or they wont. The city's too big, too mean for that. So the cars multiply like a plague and there aint nowhere to put them all. And still they build, raising towers of glass and steel to house more souls, more vehicles, more despair. The old residents watch and curse under their breath, knowing what's coming.\n\nHouses stand defiant against the apartment blocks, some big, some small, some split in two like conjoined twins. They all tell different stories of different lives, different dreams. The people living in them, they're strangers to each other now. Time was when children played in streets and knew their neighbors' names. Those days are gone, buried under the weight of progress and indifference, like so much else in this concrete wilderness.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stood like soldiers in endless formation clear to the horizon. This is what there is, he said. He knew the emptiness would strike her deep, her being from places where folk lived stacked upon folk and markets stood walking distance from any door. She'd never seen such vastness laid bare before her eyes.\n\nThe fields of corn stretched eternal and watching her face he told her tales of his youth in rural Ohio and she knew him then as she hadnt before. The road they followed, just two lanes of crumbling asphalt, led past a waterlogged quarry to where the houses stood. Brick and stucco dwellings each claiming its half acre of manicured earth, gardens tended with religious devotion. Spring brought forth flowers planted by careful hands while the native trees marked time's passage with their changing colors.\n\nMercedes automobiles gleamed in driveways like alien artifacts, their surfaces reflecting midday sun after ritual washing. The Korean, old doc they called him, could be found most days astride his green John Deere, singing above the machines drone while he cut patterns in the grass. Folk smiled at his ways but knew him for what he was - a good man with stories etched deep in his weathered face. Time had taken its toll on his mind but he persisted, a fixture like the trees themselves.\n\nThe house stood grey against the sky. Geese patrolled the yard while the terrier gave chase, an endless ritual neither side meant to conclude. Behind lay the stream that fed the quarry, its voice mixing with bullfrog song and distant cattle lowing across the fields. Past the wooden bridge they'd built by hand lay wilderness untamed - trees and herbs and flowers that grew by natures will alone. This was where childhood lived.\n\nWinter came harsh and beautiful both. The green world died to white emptiness, trees stripped to bone against grey skies. Snow transformed the land overnight into something foreign and pure. His sister's angels lay pressed in drifts while snowmen stood sentinel.

They'd launch their frozen projectiles in battles that meant everything and nothing, playing at war in a world where time hadnt yet shown its teeth."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland meets them tourist towns like old friends meetin at a crossroads. Ain't no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores with their bright lights and empty promises. Everything's a drive. Everything's a journey.\n\nThe water surrounds us like God's own embrace. Lake Michigan vast and ancient to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of em blue as judgment day. Everywhere you turn there's water waitin to baptize your feet in its cold mercy.\n\nThe houses stand like congregants at an old time revival, each one different, each one with its own history written in wood and nail and time. Some got new faces, some wear their age like medals. Most got these basements you can see from the road, like the earth opened up and swallowed part of em whole. The aluminum siding's gone gray and weary on many, weathered by seasons uncounted. Colors everywhere. Like God himself got drunk on paint one day and threw it all across the neighborhood.\n\nYards stretch out like promises. Kids' dreams scattered across em in the shape of trampolines and swing sets. Gardens grow where hope takes root. Fences mark the boundaries where folks keep their animals, keep their lives contained.\n\nThese are working people's homes. The kind of folk who wear their labor like skin and raise their young with calloused hands. Children run wild in the streets like scattered birds. Dogs walk their people. Bikes spin their wheels in the dying light. Neighbors know each other's shadows. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear.\n\nThe lawns stay trimmed like Sunday haircuts. No dead leaves permitted to rest. Everything maintained, everything in its place, like the order might keep chaos at bay. Ain't beautiful in the way fancy folks think of beautiful, but it's got something better. Got truth. Got peace.\n\nThe law sits close by, sheriff and jail both, like old testament prophets watching over their flock. The health department. The recycling center where folks bring their discarded dreams. Baseball fields echo with voices calling out names like prayers into the evening air. Small planes drone overhead like mechanical angels, coming and going from the airport that sits like a promise of escape.\n\nIce cream's within walking distance. Downtown too, if your legs got the faith. Kids can ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks of freedom stretched out before them. This here's a good place. A true place. The kind of place where America still dreams its old dreams and believes in em too.",
            "They built it all the same. Row after row of houses like children's blocks laid out by some vast and methodical hand. The HOA's presence hung over it all like a wraith, unseen but felt in every trimmed blade and painted shutter. Houses stood shoulder to shoulder, each with its measured plot of grass and scattered stone, driveways short as winter days. Trees grew where they were told, stunted things that gave no shade. Two-car garages lined up like grave markers.\n\nThe roads stretched out black and perfect, untouched by the violence of frost or neglect. No potholes marred the surface, as if decay itself had been legislated away. Most dwellings squatted low to the earth but some rose up two stories, reaching toward something they'd never grasp. The mailboxes stood in steel congregations at the street's end, uniform and cold, locked away from thieves and chaos. Package lockers gaped like empty mouths.\n\nThe neighborhood sat at the city's edge where civilization met wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land spread out vast and empty, punctuated by community pools behind their iron gates, walking trails that wound like asphalt serpents through the scrubland. Folk walked their dogs there or wandered alone in the gloaming. You could run till your legs gave out and never leave these borders.\n\nMostly it was the old ones who lived here. Retirees who'd come to die in peace, watching from behind their windows. Some younger souls mixed in, professionals with their briefcases and pressed shirts, but they were fewer. The city beyond sprawled large but carried itself like a small town, one mall standing sentinel over commerce. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to the stores - high-end markets with their organic promises, discount shops with their fluorescent desperation.\n\nIt was safe here. That's what they all said. Safe and maintained and proper. The pools gleamed blue in summer sun, the trails stretched out empty and waiting. Everything a body could want, they said, just a short drive away. But at night, when the sun bled out behind the identical rooflines, something else stirred in the spaces between the sameness, something that remembered what this land had been before the concrete came.",
            "First I heard tell of this place was through voices speaking of the vanished, crackling through wire and static like old ghosts. Strange thing. The units here they cost dear, thousand dollars or more each month gone to wind and nobody I knew had heard such tales. Maybe its the weight of living bears down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper, friends trying to hold together what little they got. We learned to scrape by. Years teach you to love the smell of other peoples castoffs, the musty sweetness of old toys and clothes wrapped in paper, mothballs like little white deaths. Your nose forgets in time. Maybe its the cigarettes or maybe the world just wears you down till you dont notice no more. But that fleamarket smell it gets in deep. Adulthood smells like magazines gone yellow stacked on piano keys nobody plays no more. Gets in the leather and wont wash out.\n\nThree secondhand stores walking distance. Start at the far end you can hit two charity shops, library with its paper smell, man selling rare books, shop full of curiosities. Downtown packed tight with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like water but step inside them shops and the world goes quiet as a grave. Good place to lose yourself. Every year more comes, more metal more flesh. They call it developing. Some big internet empire made its home here, growing pains they say. Makes me think on New York. Everybody got their own heading, nobody asks nothing of nobody. You can keep to yourself, quiet-like, independent, and folks let you be. Aint like down South where caring means getting in folks business. Here you stay in your shell long as you want and the city just rolls past like the ocean we got.\n\nPlace stays alive though. Got piano player next door, two trying to be singers up above. Less strangers more like family now. We come together when needs must, mark the birthdays and the funerals, help each other best we can. Lucky maybe. Like my neighbors well enough and they treat me fair. I mind my mess and share my food, they do the same. Pass mail back and forth like peace offerings. Good to see them and reckon they feel same about me. Living in this big cold machine of glass and steel but its them makes me think I aint ruined nothing after all.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something else entirely. Our quarter sits on the eastern edge where the houses stand weathered and bent like old men waiting. Not rich folk here. Most rent. Some own but all scratch out their days in dwellings worth less than the memories they hold.\n\nThe people here they nod and speak when you pass. Good people mostly. Violence visits sometimes like an unwelcome relative that won't stay gone. Shots ring out in the night. Bodies fall. The neighbors boy went down outside MacGruder's Bar last spring. Just went down and didn't get up again. We've been lucky. Lost nothing save what we were foolish enough to leave on the porch come nightfall.\n\nThe poison that's taken half the country hasn't spared us neither. Fentanyl's got its hooks in deep. Bodies stack up like cordwood in winter. Town's got places for them that want help. Training for them that want to save someone. Sometimes it works. Mostly it don't.\n\nYet there's good here too. The school where my boy goes stands like a fortress against the darkness. Teachers there treat him right despite his differences. No meanness follows him through those halls. The women of the PTO work like ants building community one event at a time. Every child eats free cause hunger don't care what side of town you're from.\n\nThe council men they pour money into the center of town like water into sand. New roads. Parks with fresh paint. Gardens where weeds once stood. But the east side sees none of it. Money flows west where the shoppers go and the cars pass through. East side folks watch and wait and talk about injustice in low voices.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house ain't much but it holds us. Keeps the rain out. Keeps us warm. Stores sell what we need. People know us. Sometimes at night I think about leaving but I know we won't. Some places get in your blood like a fever and won't let go. This is such a place.",
            "The hill rises like some ancient altar, crowned with buildings that remember. Seven stories up I dwell, the old theater watching silent across the way, and down below there's this place where folk gather when the summer heat bleeds into night, a bar with machines that ping and flash and draw the masses like moths to flame. They queue there, patient in the thick June air, July air, waiting for their turn at whatever salvation lies within.\n\nUphill the park sprawls vast and concrete-bound, its steps cut deep into walls that hold no memory. Winter brings the dispossessed, their canvas homes lined like soldiers' graves along the walks and stairs. Rain comes more than snow, brutal and cold, driving them together for warmth in the city's heart rather than out where the wild things grow. They walk or ride to wash where they can, the family center standing lone sentinel in miles of urban waste.\n\nBut it aint the old buildings that make this place, though they stand proud enough, scattered cross the hills that tumble oceanward. It's the people carry the real history here. Hilltop, they called it, when blood ran in gutters and gang wars painted these streets red. Federal men came through like God's own wrath, DEA badges glinting like false stars. The stories persist, passed down like scripture, mother to child, stranger to stranger, reaching even outsiders like me who came after.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though others still name it rough country. White folk, they say, best clear out after dark. But that's old poison talking, the kind that seeps through generations like bad water through limestone. Maybe it's my skin, dark enough to pass, or maybe Hilltop sees what's truly in a soul. These streets know the weight of racism, know how fear breeds in ignorance like rats in walls, even here in this supposed melting pot paradise.\n\nThis much I know true: Hilltop's got my bones now. These night streets pulse with life, and strangers offer warmth before threat. Laundry women keep doors open past closing just to shelter a charging phone, and concrete storefronts become sanctuaries. Even when I try to fade into shadow, someone always sees. They press wrinkled bills into palms and speak of beauty and worth like prophets of some new religion. This is home, and it holds its own terrible grace.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade, the houses standing like sentinels in the gathering dusk. Strange and lonesome at first until I found kinship with two boys who lived along that same stretch of asphalt. They're gone now but the memories remain like shadows cast by a setting sun. The old neighbors persist, their faces weathered by time but unchanged in their routines.\n\nThe houses rise two stories tall, cookie-cutter monuments to suburban dreams. Children's voices carry on the wind when the weather turns warm, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and perfectly trimmed hedges. Most days the quiet settles like dust. The people here keep to themselves except in times of need, a silent covenant between strangers sharing the same patch of earth. Packages appear and remain untouched on porches, a testament to some lingering trust in human nature.\n\nThe park lies just beyond, a small stretch of green where memories collect like fallen leaves. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked courts where we played our games, the concrete holding stories of triumph and blood. One day my nose burst red against someone's elbow in a football game, but such wounds heal and good memories outweigh the bad like light outweighs shadow. Now I watch my cousin's children chase their own joy there, their small bodies arcing through space on swing sets, their excitement pure and uncontained.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth can be found here - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within walking distance. Though nowadays people summon their meals through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints stand on every corner like modern-day trading posts. The stores stock everything a body might need, from medicine to groceries to spices from the old country. Even got an Indian market where the air hangs heavy with cardamom and cumin.\n\nI've come to know this place like the back of my hand, grateful for its quiet dignity when I read tales of neighborhood wars and porch pirates in other places. Some folks don't know how good they got it till they see how bad it could be.",
            "The college stands near where I lay my head. Not far. Walking distance. Buildings rise up like concrete monoliths, weathered and old, their faces worn by time and indifference. Bars and eateries dot the streets between, some cheaper than others, some renamed in vain attempts at reinvention. The new one charges more but the spirits flow just the same.\n\nPeople here exist in two tribes: the students with their books and dreams, and the poor with their burdens. Children too, countless, drawn by the elementary school that squats beyond the asphalt. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how it'll stay. They fill the halls with sweet smoke and management's response was to mount some perfumed contraption across their door. A joke told in plastic and chemicals.\n\nThe buildings stand like tired sentinels. Some wear new faces inside their old bones. Down the way they've raised new apartments, built quick and cheap, charging gold for copper. A sin against honest architecture but they know the students will come. They always come.\n\nThere's a place serves food on paper plates. Microwave hum their constant prayer. Gas station across the way. Bad place to work they say. City money brought new concrete though. Wide sidewalks. Grass growing where there wasn't before. Nature tamed and parceled.\n\nTrees shelter my building like ancient guardians. Some fell to the saw, their stumps testament to their last stand. More trees here than down the road where the light hits harder. Behind us lies 43rd street, meaner somehow. Broken sidewalks like a mouthful of bad teeth. Buildings trying to hide their shame behind green curtains of leaves. Violence visits there more often, though it knows no boundaries. Crosses the street sometimes to where the wanderers live in their temporary homes.\n\nBut this place suits me well enough. Money flows easier here and the necessities of life stand close. The university and its promise remains within reach, and the buses come regular as heartbeats, carrying people to store and city alike. Some might call it home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dying light, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all but rather houses strung along the curved road like beads on some great necklace. Folk here they know each other mostly. They gather in the gloaming at the end of drives not chosen but found and speak of things that matter little while their young ones mark the concrete with chalk or chase kites against the dimming sky. Like some forgotten time. Like the world aint gone mad with its screens and circuits and endless hum of progress.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees stand ancient witness while clouds white as bone drift across the blue vault above. But the weather it turns cruel sometimes. Last night the sirens wailed their banshee song and we all knew what it meant. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever precious things I could gather while the big one paced and barked at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles scattered across the earth. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cool, temperature falling like a stone from ninety-two to seventy-five. The ice melted where it struck leaving ghost marks on the pavement.\n\nThen the sun broke through and rain fell still and there appeared above us twin arcs of color like some covenant with the sky. Captured it with the camera though such things aint meant for keeping. People emerged slow from their shelters like creatures after flood, and life took up its rhythm again. Women calling children home to supper.\n\nThis place it speaks different from New Hampshire. Got its own tongue, soft and sweet as honey. The houses mirror each other outside but inside they're as different as the folk who dwell in them. Behind my place theres a field stretches down to a pond where no one swims and sometimes deer step quiet in the dawn while bullfrogs sing their ancient songs. Charlotte lies forty minutes distant but here the roosters still announce the morning and somewhere in the gathering dark a donkey brays his lonesome prayer. Like some village lost to time, found again in this corner of North Carolina. A place that still remembers what it means to be a place.",
            "Ten years now. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. First light of Stockbridge felt wrong after Riverdale, like wearing someone else's skin. Tears came unbidden. Mother and father, they wanted better. Better schools, better houses, better lives for their young. Away from what folk called the ghetto though such words mean little to children who know only home.\n\nTime passes like water through fingers. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange except for Glen and Dennis who lived adjacent. Good people. Family almost, if blood weren't the judge of such things. Remember Glen's wedding clear as yesterday's sun. Him getting married again, wife in white. Veda, they called her. She threw that white garter and somehow it found my hand though the flowers went elsewhere. We danced. All of us. Marsharii, Glen's daughter, she danced too. Ain't seen her since. World takes people where it will.\n\nThe streets here wind like serpents but technology guides now where feet once wandered blind. Kason and Curtis, we'd game together. Young men killing time like it was endless. The park became sanctuary. Something holy in the quiet there. Brought sticks from the hardware store, practice balance like them eastern warriors. Wooden sword too sometimes. Basketball court and tennis lanes lay empty now but memory serves up old games. Father and Mr. Graves teaching tennis, working us till sweat ran rivers. Joy in the work though. Always joy.\n\nNeighborhood holds stories like earth holds bones. Some rise up, others stay buried. But like them preachers say, best is yet to come. Though who can say what best means in a world that turns regardless of our wishes.",
            "The town dont stand apart from any other in South Carolina but it carries the weight of peaches on its back like some ancient burden. Johnston they call it. Peach Capital of the World emblazoned on a sign weathered and proud against the sky. The land stretches vast and empty save for the peach trees standing like sentinels in ordered rows or the black cattle that dot the fields like moving shadows.\n\nHouses stand apart from one another like strangers at a wake. Metal roofs gleam under the merciless southern sun or gray shingles fade like old memories. They squat back from the road behind fields where beasts graze and crops rise from the red earth. The town proper hangs suspended around a single stoplight, its red eye blinking at the crossroads where commerce gatheres like vultures at a carcass.\n\nThree places serve what passes for sustenance: the Chinese family at Hong Kong, their faces worn smooth like river stones, the Mexicans at their Fiesta, and Gary's where burgers slide across greased counters. The pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford, deals in medicines and cherry cola, each equally addictive to the locals. IGA stands alone, a grocery outpost charging siege prices while the townfolk flee to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville like refugees seeking sanctuary.\n\nDollar General rules this kingdom of small needs, its aisles always full, a bazaar of plastic and necessity. The furniture woman tends her store of possibilities like a garden, her two movers strong as oxen carrying couches across thresholds. Next door they wash dogs at Clark's, soap and water bringing order to chaos.\n\nThe doctors tend to man and beast in separate buildings on the outskirts, like some biblical separation. Children learn their letters at Johnston Elementary until fifth grade sends them away like young exiles to the next town over. They speak of parks to come, two and a half acres of manufactured pleasure, but for now the land remains raw and untamed.\n\nNo picture shows, no bowling alleys, no gathering places where youth might congregate like starlings on a wire. Just earth and sky and peach trees and cattle, a town so small you might pass through it between heartbeats, like a dream half-remembered in the morning light.",
            "We live where the asphalt runs between two highways in the southern part of Tennessee, the road black and endless and carrying the burden of too many strangers passing through. The houses stand like tired sentinels, their occupants long familiar to us now, their faces worn by time and weather and the daily rituals that bind them to this place. They move about their yards like penitents, raking leaves that fall eternal from ancient trees that stood here before any of us drew breath.\n\nThe house sits at the corner where we watch the world pass. Four souls dwell within. Me and the wife and two girls, eleven and fourteen, their youth still unmarked by time. We know the machines that pass, their engines humming familiar songs, and when strange metal beasts prowl our streets we mark them well, our eyes following their passage like wary predators.\n\nWinter brings children to the hill on the side street, their sleds cutting dark paths in virgin snow. But winters grow weak now, mere shadows of seasons past, and fall stretches long and dark across the calendar like a dying man's shadow. The mowers drone from spring until the dying time of October, their mechanical voices a chorus that echoes through the trees that crowd our lots like wooden armies.\n\nThe garage stands rear-ward, dark and waiting. When I work there the doors yawn open like great metal maws and I can taste the neighborhood on my tongue. Smell the smoke from burning leaves that marks the death of summer. Watch the barbecue smoke rise from back decks like signals from ancient tribes. Holiday times bring strange cars and foreign faces, metal and flesh crowding the streets like refugees from some distant war.\n\nWe rarely use the front door. It stands like a forgotten sentinel, its knock a rare herald of the outside world trying to breach our sanctuary. The traffic flows endless past our corner, a river of metal and exhaust that mars what might otherwise be perfect. But this is our place and we abide here, watching the seasons turn and the leaves fall and the children grow beneath these ancient trees that remember more than any of us ever will.",
            "The desert stretches out like some vast brown altar, dirt and more dirt reaching toward mountains that stand ancient and indifferent. A man who ain't lived here don't know what it means to see nothing but brown, and when you spy a patch of grass you know that somebody's paying dear for such vanity. Back in the nineties the houses stood apart like scattered bones in the waste. Still do mostly, though new structures rise up now like teeth through flesh.\n\nThe place grows citified day by day but that's the way of all things now. Folk are friendly enough but like anywhere there's good and there's bad and there's those that don't know which they are. My patch is ringed with old folks, quiet and decent enough. The stores are all chains, Food for Less and Smart and Final standing like concrete sentinels. Ain't no fancy markets here. You want that kind of thing you got to travel.\n\nConstruction rules these parts. Men with hammers and steel raising frames against the sky. Too much empty space calling out to be filled though that thought carries its own kind of dread. Left the big city behind and ain't keen to see it follow me here. I'm in construction myself, hanging drywall and T-bar, my hands knowing the work like they know their own shape.\n\nThe animals though. That's what makes this place. They was here first and they know it. Desert creatures moving through their own world like they was reading from some ancient script. Lizards and bugs carrying on their own wars and treaties while we watch from our windows. My three young ones chase these creatures with the dedication of scientists, their small hands reaching out toward mystery.\n\nThe county fair comes round once a year like some traveling carnival of dreams. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like God's own frosting. Down below the Victor Valley Museum holds its bones and artifacts, telling stories of what was and what might have been. Native peoples left their mark here, their ghost stories still echoing across the waste. This high desert holds its secrets close, revealing them only to those patient enough to wait, to watch, to listen to what the wind's been trying to tell us all along.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete plain, dormitories rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. This here aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of. No white picket fences or cookie-cutter homes with manicured lawns. This here's my home all the same.\n\nThe buildings stand sentinel, three breeds of dwelling each with their own purpose ordained by some nameless architect long dead. The apartments squat low against the ground, two stories high and filled with the breath and movement of twenty souls give or take. Then there's the houses proper, scattered like dice across the grounds, mostly filled with them that used to walk these halls in years past. But it's the dormitories that tower above all else, great concrete beehives housing hundreds, each cell containing two bodies sharing the same air, same walls, same destiny.\n\nThe people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds walking the same paths worn smooth by countless feet before them. The old ones, the professors and such, they keep to them houses dotted bout the grounds. The young ones, fresh-faced and raw, they fill them dormitories like cattle in pens. The ones in between, they take to them apartments like some middle ground between youth and wisdom.\n\nGot stores here too, though not like what you'd find in town proper. Places to eat, places to buy books and clothes with the school's mark on em like some tribal insignia. And there's this park, kept clean by some unspoken covenant between all them that call this place home. A green space where all kinds gather, where the borders between professor and student blur like heat waves rising off summer asphalt.\n\nThis here's my neighborhood, strange as it might seem to them living in proper towns. But it's got its own heartbeat, its own rules, its own way of being. And that's something true as sunrise.",
            "Aint no sidewalks here. The world slopes down and away like some great tilted plate and the house stands alone atop the highest rise where runners come daily to test themselves against the grade. They call it the workout hill. People walk in the road for there aint nowhere else to walk and the pavement is broke and scarred like the face of some ancient warrior. The wires hang slack between their poles, twisted and spliced and mended time and again by storms that rake the coast. Everywhere the evergreens rise up dark and brooding but folk here hate them, cut them down with a vengeance for blocking their view of the water. They build their houses tall with walls of glass that peer out across the bay like lidless eyes, each trying to outreach its neighbor.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns like molten copper but mostly the sky stays gray and the clouds hang low and everything that dont move grows a coat of green fur. Moss claims whatever it can. Left my truck sitting a month and found it transformed to something prehistoric and verdant. Three hours with a scraper to bring the metal back to light.\n\nThe old ones live here mostly. Retired folk. Where you might expect children you find dogs running loose and wild, pushing through open doors like they own the place. Found one in my parlor once, staring at me like I was the intruder. The rabbits too have claimed this land, great fat ones that dig up gardens until my cats find them. Birds wheel overhead - tiny things mostly, but sometimes an eagle riding the thermals until the crows drive it off like they was protecting their own piece of sky.\n\nDown the hill where the land meets the water there's places that serve up whatever the bay gives them that day. No proper beach but rocks enough to throw, watching them vanish into the gray water. The far shore sits like a dark wall through the mist, close enough to mock but too far to touch.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some sprawling beast in Brooklyn's belly, its streets a maze of concrete and steel that any fool with a metrocard could find. The trains come and go like metal serpents beneath the earth, carrying the masses in their steel bellies. Urban it was, yes, urban as any place could be in this city of endless windows and hard angles.\n\nThe Asians had come. Twenty years now they'd been coming, setting up their shops like territory markers, one after another after another until you couldn't walk a block without seeing their signs in characters that looked like birds taking flight. Markets and laundries mostly. Good places. Clean places. The people knew it too, knew the worth of fresh fish and vegetables that didn't cost a week's wages. Where I stood you could throw a stone and hit four such markets, though there wasn't any call to do such a thing.\n\nThe place wasn't all Asian though. It was a patchwork of souls, immigrants and their children and their children's children, all of them carrying their histories like invisible weights. The park stood renovated and gleaming, a testament to some bureaucrat's promise kept. Basketball courts stretched out like dominoes, soccer fields lay green and waiting, handball courts stood silent until the next game. Children's laughter echoed off the water fountains in summer, all colors and creeds mixing like watercolors in the rain.\n\nNo towers here. No glass monuments to corporate greed. Just homes stacked two deep, families living above families, and the occasional co-op rising like a concrete tombstone. The people were good enough but the noise lived in your bones. Cars would pass with their music bleeding through windows, engines screaming like wounded animals in the dark hours.\n\nNight brought its own rules. Safe enough they said but safety was a thin blanket that could tear. Violence lived here too, in the shadows between streetlights. Thieves took packages from doorsteps like coyotes stealing eggs from nests. Dogs left their marks on sidewalks despite the city's laws, their owners' negligence a testament to man's indifference to man. Every morning the evidence lay there, waiting for an unwary step, like little landmines of urban living.",
            "First thing about Portland Oregon is what weird means and you best understand that before anything else. There's words painted on the back wall of some establishment that serves pizza and music and flesh and liquor and maybe half of what goes on there aint strictly legal but the words say Keep Portland Weird like some prayer or incantation against the darkness. Some folk say it's a remembrance of older times when the city was cheaper and stranger and bred peculiar tribes in its rainswept streets. Others hear it like a calling, like come to this place where your strangeness will be blessed instead of cursed.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their clean clothes and their condominium towers rise like concrete prophets against the grey sky but the weird abides. Not that weird means kind exactly but it means tolerant of things that most places would turn away. We got our Walmarts same as anywhere and our Chinese goods and our fights about politics but somehow it's different here. Like God took normal and twisted it sideways and that's what we got.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that would shame a sunset and gardens grow wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers mixing like old friends. And there's the free boxes. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass by in human form. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes stranger things. Magic things. Things that find the right person at the right time like they was meant to.\n\nThat's Portland to me though I'm just one kind of strange in an ocean of strange. Some folks wouldn't touch those sidewalk treasures with a ten foot pole but they'll do yoga with goats or scream themselves hoarse at soccer matches and that's their kind of weird. We're all chasing something here, dreams or ghosts or just the bottom of a whiskey glass.\n\nThe rain comes constant most months, grey and eternal as time itself, and it breeds darkness in some souls. We got our addicts and our crazy folk and our homeless camps spread out like refugee settlements from some war nobody remembers fighting. The city tries to help but help aint ever enough and the people who still got homes swing between charity and rage like a pendulum. In that we're just like anywhere else. Just normal folk trying to figure out what to do with all our broken pieces.",
            "They stand in the north like ancient gods. Bearing witness. Patient and cruel in their permanence. The mountains. No matter what tribulations of man pass beneath them they remain. Unmoved. Unchanged. When the mind grows weary with the tasks of living they command attention like some dark covenant writ in stone and earth and there is no choice but to look upon them and draw what strength remains in their presence.\n\nI came here young. A student. The university buildings stood ornate and proper but it was the mountains that held dominion over all. The town below stretched out like some dying creature, its cafes and shops the last breaths of civilization before the wild. Students haunted these places like restless ghosts, their minds clouded with coffee and desperation, seeking answers in books that held none. Further on lay the old downtown with its weathered brick facades. A false promise of urbanity. The library marked some invisible boundary between this pretense and the quiet beyond. As if god himself had drawn a line in chalk and dared not cross it.\n\nMemories collect in such places like detritus after a flood. Some precious, some bitter. The rusted playground equipment stands sentinel over countless midnight wanderings. The theater with its gaudy lights bears witness to brief moments of joy. But it is the ponds that hold the darkest hours. Where tears fall silent in the small hours while creatures crawl and swim about their meaningless lives, ignorant of human suffering. Standing there in those moments the question of purpose hangs heavy as a noose.\n\nWalking north past suburban houses that squat like toads in their perfect rows. The sun breaks over palm trees and paints the sky in colors that have no names. And there they stand. As they have always stood. As they will always stand. The mountains. Their peaks pierce the morning haze like knives and speak without speaking of endurance. Of persistence. Of the terrible burden of continuing on.",
            "You'd pass it by and think nothing of it. Nothing at all. Just another strip of commerce dying slow in the southern heat behind which people made their homes whether they ought to or not. Past the hollow shell of what was once a Whole Foods and beyond the hotels that stand near empty save summer's brief fever dream of reunions and gatherings, there they lived. Row on row of apartments lined up like children's toys forgotten in the dust. God's own dioramas of life and living.\n\nThe first block carried stories dark as pitch in the evening news but appearances deceive and truth hides in shadow. Beyond lay something else entirely. Something the townsfolk knew nothing of, cared nothing for. Across the way stood the college, squat and institutional, where students shuffled in bearing paper cups of coffee like votive offerings to some modernday deity of education. Iron gates keened their morning song while traffic built and drivers cursed the dawdling scholars before them.\n\nThe road met its end at another, a T-shaped communion of asphalt where the rehabilitation center faced down the park across the way. Ceiling fans turned lazy circles in the thick summer air while the broken and healing watched life pass by from rocking chairs. Children moved like wild things through the grass, their bodies describing geometries of youth while bees performed their ancient dance among the roadside flowers. The elderly walked their dogs and cast dark looks at boys on wheeled boards, nodding proper-like to clusters of girls who spoke in whispers of boys and digital fame.\n\nStrip mall life carried on beside them. A sushi place that time forgot. A pool supply store. Nail salon wedged between like an afterthought. Modern convenience stacked and ordered, everything at hand. The frozen yogurt place drew them in, those young ones with their boards and their vapor clouds, thinking themselves immortal in the weight of summer air. This was America distilled, the south preserved in amber, where time moved slow as molasses and change came gentle as a whisper, if it came at all.",
            "The houses stand like tired sentinels. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still in their weathered watch. Small plots of earth before them where dreams once grew green and verdant now lay fallow and forgotten. Driveways narrow and cracked lead to homes that whisper of times past when suburban living was the covenant of american prosperity. That dream now recedes like evening tide leaving behind only shells of what once was. Yet the neighborhood persists. It calls out with voice ancient and true to those who would listen that all is not lost, that some fragment of that dream yet lives in the hearts of those who remain.\n\nThe people walk more slowly now. Their eyes cast down at yards gone wild where once pride bloomed in careful rows. Cars still rest in drives, their metal skin oxidized and weeping. Children play in streets wide as salvation, their world bounded by the horizon of youth and innocence. The school rises from concrete like some primitive godhouse, ninety years of hopes and futures stored in its brick belly. Churches stand empty save for dust and memory while basketball rings sing metallic hymns to those who still worship there.\n\nEach house different yet bound in common suffering. The market, Super A, squats beneath a sun-bleached sign, run by Yemeni folk who stand apart in their solitude among the mostly black residents. Wide streets become impromptu fields where young boys play at football, scattering like starlings when cars approach. Old folk speak of times when names were known and faces familiar, their words carrying the weight of generations.\n\nWhere once stood a temple to eastern combat arts now stands a dispensary of modern medicines, hollywood dreams replaced by chemical comfort. The cinema remains, a refuge for the old who find solace in flickering shadows of better days, while young ones pass it by like mourners at a stranger's grave. The expressway runs past but does not touch this place, kept at bay by elders who saw in its concrete arteries the death of something precious and unnamed. They build new schools now and speak of mascots, as if such tokens might ward off the future that comes for them all, inexorable as night.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, its streets a twisted maze of commerce and dwelling places strewn about like bones scattered by some ancient beast. Buildings rise and fall in their purpose, some for living and some for trade, and none seeming to care much for the order of things. Eateries spring up like weeds after rain, and shops both corporate and small huddle together in the shadow of progress. The small ones, they persist somehow, clinging to life along the streets that wind past neighborhoods that aint never known true quiet, not with the world pressing in all around.\n\nParks dot the landscape like green wounds in the concrete, where children still play and their mothers watch with tired eyes. The people here, they come from everywhere and nowhere. The queers and the Jews and the Russians all staked their claims, carved out their territories in this godless expanse. Further out lie the other tribes - the Koreans, the Chinese, the Armenians - each with their own small kingdoms in the urban waste, though none but ten miles distant as the crow flies.\n\nBut distance here is measured in time and suffering. Ten miles might mean two hours of your life, lost to the endless river of machines that choke the streets. Nobody walks. They cant. Or they wont. The city's too big, too mean for that. So the cars multiply like a plague and there aint nowhere to put them all. And still they build, raising towers of glass and steel to house more souls, more vehicles, more despair. The old residents watch and curse under their breath, knowing what's coming.\n\nHouses stand defiant against the apartment blocks, some big, some small, some split in two like conjoined twins. They all tell different stories of different lives, different dreams. The people living in them, they're strangers to each other now. Time was when children played in streets and knew their neighbors' names. Those days are gone, buried under the weight of progress and indifference, like so much else in this concrete wilderness.",
            "Where is it all at, she said. The corn stood like soldiers in endless formation clear to the horizon. This is what there is, he said. He knew the emptiness would strike her deep, her being from places where folk lived stacked upon folk and markets stood walking distance from any door. She'd never seen such vastness laid bare before her eyes.\n\nThe fields of corn stretched eternal and watching her face he told her tales of his youth in rural Ohio and she knew him then as she hadnt before. The road they followed, just two lanes of crumbling asphalt, led past a waterlogged quarry to where the houses stood. Brick and stucco dwellings each claiming its half acre of manicured earth, gardens tended with religious devotion. Spring brought forth flowers planted by careful hands while the native trees marked time's passage with their changing colors.\n\nMercedes automobiles gleamed in driveways like alien artifacts, their surfaces reflecting midday sun after ritual washing. The Korean, old doc they called him, could be found most days astride his green John Deere, singing above the machines drone while he cut patterns in the grass. Folk smiled at his ways but knew him for what he was - a good man with stories etched deep in his weathered face. Time had taken its toll on his mind but he persisted, a fixture like the trees themselves.\n\nThe house stood grey against the sky. Geese patrolled the yard while the terrier gave chase, an endless ritual neither side meant to conclude. Behind lay the stream that fed the quarry, its voice mixing with bullfrog song and distant cattle lowing across the fields. Past the wooden bridge they'd built by hand lay wilderness untamed - trees and herbs and flowers that grew by natures will alone. This was where childhood lived.\n\nWinter came harsh and beautiful both. The green world died to white emptiness, trees stripped to bone against grey skies. Snow transformed the land overnight into something foreign and pure. His sister's angels lay pressed in drifts while snowmen stood sentinel. They'd wage their wars then, him and his sister, behind fortifications of packed snow reinforced with dead branches. They'd launch their frozen projectiles in battles that meant everything and nothing, playing at war in a world where time hadnt yet shown its teeth."
