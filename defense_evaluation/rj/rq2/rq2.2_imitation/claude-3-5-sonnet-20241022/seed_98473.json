            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland stretches out like some ancient quilt til it meets them tourist towns that sprout up like weeds after rain. Aint no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores with their bright lights calling like sirens. Everything's scattered and far, requiring wheels and gasoline and time.\n\nThe water surrounds us like God's own embrace. Lake Michigan vast and terrible to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them ancient and cold and blue as judgment. Everywhere you turn there's water waiting to swallow your feet, beaches stretched out like promises.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old men at a funeral. Each one different, each one carrying its years like scars. Some got new paint and windows gleaming like fresh eyes, others wear their age in peeling aluminum siding and weathered wood. Most got basements you can see from the street, concrete tombs sunk into the earth like buried secrets.\n\nThe yards spread wide and wild. Trampolines stand like metal mushrooms, swing sets rust in the rain. Gardens grow where folks put them, and fences hold dogs that bark at shadows. These houses speak of work and sweat and mortgage payments. They speak of children grown and children growing.\n\nKids run these streets like wild horses, their voices carrying on the wind. People walking dogs nod to neighbors they know by name and blood and time. The grass gets cut cause that's what's done. The bushes get trimmed cause that's what's expected. Ain't beautiful like them magazines show, but it's real and it's home and it's safe.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, all concrete and steel, and the planes from the small airport tear the sky like paper. Baseball games echo through the evening air, announcer's voice carrying like scripture across the diamond. Ice cream shop's walking distance if your legs'll carry you, and downtown ain't but a dream away.\n\nThis here's where life happens. Where children ride bikes through twilight and folks still wave from porches. Where the world ain't perfect but it's good enough. Where we all end up at day's end, coming home to roost like birds to the wire, knowing this is where we belong.",
            "The houses stand like sentinels in their measured plots, uniform and unyielding to time or circumstance, governed by some unseen authority that commands their conformity. They'd laid the homes out in perfect rows, each yard a mirror of its neighbor with strips of manicured grass and stones placed just so, as if some great hand had scattered them with deliberate indifference. The driveways, short and severe, lead to twin-door garages where vehicles sleep in climate-controlled darkness.\n\nThe concrete beneath lies pristine and unmarked, as if the very earth had been forbidden to crack or heave against man's dominion. No mailboxes stand guard at the roadside like in times past. Instead they'd gathered them in metallic colonies at the street's end, all locked away behind cold steel doors that yield only to their appointed keys.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out toward the city's edge where civilization gives way to something older and less ordered. Here the land spreads vast and accommodating, dotted with swimming pools enclosed by iron fences and threading paths that wind through stands of trees like veins in some great living thing. The retired folk who'd made this place their sanctuary move about in measured steps, watching, nodding, keeping their silent vigil over the younger ones who'd come to dwell among them.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own peculiar heartbeat, neither fully urban nor truly rural, holding within its bounds a single mall that serves as some modern-day gathering place. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction leads to commerce of every stripe - stores stocked floor to ceiling with organic produce and wholesome things, while others stand sparse and stripped down to bare essentials, each serving its purpose in the greater scheme of things.\n\nHere in this manufactured eden, everything has its place and purpose. The pools shimmer blue and chlorinated under the sun, the trails wind their predetermined course, and the houses stand in their perfect rows, all of it maintained by some invisible hand that brooks no deviation from its prescribed order. A place where safety is not just promised but delivered, where the inhabitants move through their days in a dance of practiced contentment, fifteen minutes away from whatever modern convenience their hearts might desire.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through some voices speaking of the vanished and the dead, crackling through wire and static like spirits trapped in the machine. Strange thing to hear. All them units going for north of a thousand dollars and not a whisper of such tales among friends or strangers alike. Maybe its the weight of living pressing down. Known folks who weep in the dark hours, silent tears for the cost of breath itself. We learned to pare down, to whittle life to its barest bones.\n\nThe smell of poverty has its own character. Flea market toys carrying the dust of forgotten childhoods, clothes bearing the chemical ghosts of preservation. Your nose dies slow in the growing years. Some take to tobacco, others just lose the ability to care. But the markets persist, eternal as sin. Adulthood smells like yellowed paper on dead pianos, leather drinking deep the must and holding it like a memory that won't wash clean.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking distance of where I lay my head. Start at the far end and you can work your way through charity shops, past the library where knowledge sleeps in dim light, through places where rare books gather dust and curious things wait patient as vultures. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but the thrift stores stay silent as tombs. Good place to lose yourself when time has no meaning. Every year brings more bodies, more machines. They call it progress. Some big digital empire planted its flag here, spreading like a fever through the streets.\n\nMakes me think of New York. Everyone carrying their own private wars, asking nothing, telling less. You can wrap yourself in silence like a burial shroud and nobody pays mind. Not like down South where concern masquerades as kindness. Here you keep your walls high as you please and the city just rolls past like dark water.\n\nLife finds its way though. Got a pianist next door speaking in midnight sonatas, singers above trying to catch whatever glory floats past their window. Less strangers now, more like tribes gathering against the dark. We share our bread and our sorrows, mark the passages of life and death together. Found myself fortunate in this concrete maze. These people, they become something like blood. We trade food and kindnesses, carry each other's mail like sacred texts. Living in this steel and glass leviathan but these souls around me, they make it feel like home might feel, if home was something you could hold onto in this world.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something less defined. We occupy the eastern quarter where the houses stand worn and weathered like tired soldiers, their paint peeling in the summer heat, their foundations settling into earth that holds no promise. Not an ugly place. Not yet. The people here still nod and wave, their eyes holding something genuine despite what time and circumstance have wrought upon them.\n\nViolence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome relative who brings darkness in his wake. Gunshots have echoed down these streets. Blood has seeped into these gutters. The neighbors boy, not yet twenty, fell outside a bar last year, his life leaking out onto concrete that had seen such things before. We've lost nothing save some forgotten items from the porch, trinkets really, carried off by desperate hands in the night.\n\nThe poison that plagues the nation has found root here too. Fentanyl. A word that sounds clinical but kills like any bullet. Bodies stack up quiet-like while the town builds centers for healing, teaches people how to bring back the dead with sprays and prayers and hope.\n\nYet there's light here. The school where my boy goes stands like a fortress against the darkness. The teachers there, they understand something about dignity that money can't buy. They feed every child, ask nothing in return. No one goes hungry. No one stands apart. My boy, different as he is, walks those halls without fear.\n\nThe town council builds and repairs, plants trees and paves roads, but their attention falls mainly westward where the commerce flows. Here on the east side we watch the improvements pass us by like rain that falls on other fields. Still we endure. Sixteen years in this house that's worth nothing to anyone but us, surrounded by neighbors who understand that survival itself is a kind of victory. This is our place. These are our people. And that's a thing worth holding onto in this world.",
            "The neighborhood rises like some ancient stone altar, buildings of time-worn significance crowding the slopes. My dwelling, seven stories of concrete and steel, stands sentinel across from the theater house where ghosts of performances past still linger in the rafters. Down the hill there's a place where games sing their electric songs into the night and folk of all breeds gather when the summer heat bleeds into evening. They queue there like penitents, waiting for admission into their neon sanctuary.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast as a wound in the urban fabric. Concrete walls grip it like a fortress, steps carved into the gray mass like ancient hieroglyphs. When winter comes the homeless arrange their temporary cities there, canvas homes lined with military precision along the steps and walks. Rain falls eternal, biblical in its persistence, and they huddle together like animals seeking warmth in numbers, closer to civilization than the verdant chaos beyond the city's edge. The family center stands like a beacon, offering ablutions to those who can make the journey.\n\nBut it aint the weathered majesty of the architecture nor the way the hills tumble oceanward that gives this place its pulse. It's the people who carry history in their marrow. Hilltop wore its violence like a crown once, when gangs ruled these streets like warlords of old. Federal men came through like avenging angels, but memories dont wash away like blood in the rain. Stories persist, passed down like sacred texts, testament to darker days.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though outsiders still whisper warnings about white folk walking these blocks after sunset. But such words carry the poison of old prejudice, born of fear and ignorance in a place that pretends at being some multicultural paradise. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass unmarked, or maybe these streets know their own.\n\nThese blocks have become my territory, my home ground. I've walked them in darkness and found more charity than malice. Seen laundry keepers extend their hours for a stranger's need, witnessed beauty in the eyes of those who'd press crumpled bills into trembling hands. Even huddled against shop fronts in the grey deluge, invisible to all the world, I've been seen, been told of my worth by voices emerging from the gloom like prophecy.\n\nThis is Hilltop. These are my streets. This is home.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade, the houses standing like sentinels in the August heat. The loneliness was a thing that lived and breathed but it passed like a fever dream when I met the boys two doors down, though they're gone now, scattered like leaves in some wind I cannot name. The old families persist, their faces weathered like the vinyl siding that wraps their two-story dwellings in this American tableau of suburban life.\n\nChildren's voices carry across the lawns on warm days, their laughter a currency traded in sunshine. The quiet here is a living thing too, broken only by necessity. Trust flows like water between houses. Packages appear and remain, untouched by the darker impulses that plague other places.\n\nThe park stands sentinel a short walk away, a chronicle of memories etched in dirt and steel. We played there, the neighborhood boys and I, our games a ritual of basketball and football and baseball until the day blood ran from my nose like war paint, courtesy of an elbow thrown without malice. Now I shepherd my cousin's children there, their small bodies arcing through space on swings, their joy pure and uncut like light through clean glass.\n\nThe streets here are a bazaar of cultures, food from distant lands served in storefronts that glow in the evening like paper lanterns. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a mile's reach. Modern conveniences bring it to doorsteps now, carried by strangers in cars who appear and vanish like ghosts. Fast food joints stand on corners like churches, their signs blazing in neon prophecy.\n\nThe stores string together like beads on a chain - Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco - names that mark this territory as Midwestern as surely as the prairie once did. An Indian store stands among them, spices in glass jars like captured sunsets.\n\nThis neighborhood holds me like a book holds its stories. When I read of other places, other neighbors bearing darkness in their hearts, I know the worth of what I have here. Some things cannot be measured except in their absence.",
            "The college looms beyond the edge of where I dwell, a blessing or curse depending on the day. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths, apartments mostly, with drinking establishments and eateries scattered among them like wayward children. They renamed one of the bars. Made it expensive. Dont matter none, the whiskey burns the same.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes. Students with their books and dreams and the poor folk who cant afford better. Children too, countless of them, drawn to the elementary school like moths to flame. My neighbors I dont know and dont care to know. The sweet acrid stench of their marijuana seeps through the walls and management, in their infinite wisdom, mounted an air freshener across their door like some crude totem of propriety.\n\nOld buildings stand sentinel, their facades weathered by time though their innards have been gutted and remade. Down the street they built new ones, cheap things dressed in finery, charging gold prices for cardboard walls. They know the students will come. They always do.\n\nA restaurant sits five minutes walking distance, serving microwaved sustenance on paper plates like some post-apocalyptic mess hall. The gas station opposite, a place where souls go to die slowly under fluorescent lights. The city came through with money once, laid new concrete, planted grass in strips like bandages over old wounds. Made things look proper.\n\nTrees crowd my building like mourners at a wake. Some they cut down, leaving stumps like grave markers. Behind us lies 43rd street, a place god forgot. Broken sidewalks like shattered bones, buildings wearing decay like an old coat. Crime flourishes there like weeds through cracked pavement. Though truth be told, violence knows no boundaries here. It visits the apartments across from me just the same.\n\nYet I remain. The rent dont break me and I can walk to my classes. Buses come and go like mechanical pilgrims, carrying folks to market and downtown. Perhaps this aint paradise but it's something close enough to home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels on the cul-de-sac, their white porches gleaming under metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses set apart from one another in some ancient rhythm known only to the builder. Folk here they know each other mostly. Some evenings we gather in driveways unplanned and watching the children mark the concrete with chalk colors or send their kites up into that vast blue nothing. Like some forgotten time. Some world before the machines took hold.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the sky where clouds move like great white ships. But the sky it turns on you here. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark and we all knew what that meant. I took myself to the bathtub with the little dog and some pillows and my purse like that would save anything at all. The big dog wouldnt come. Just stood in the living room barking at something he could sense but not see. Then the hail came. It fell like God's own buckshot hitting the ground and everything went quiet except for that sound.\n\nAfter the storm passed the road steamed like some devil's cookpot. The temperature dropped seventeen degrees in minutes. Hail melted soon as it touched the hot pavement leaving nothing but ghost puddles in the street. Sun broke through and the rain was still falling and then there it was. Two rainbows hung in the sky like some biblical promise. I took pictures. Sent them to people who weren't there to see it. The street stayed quiet for an hour maybe more till folks came back from wherever they'd hidden themselves during the storm.\n\nThis place aint like New Hampshire where I come from. The houses might look alike outside but inside they're all different like people are different. Some small some big and it dont make no sense but there it is. I walk the field out back sometimes down to the pond where nobody swims. Deer move through there in the morning and you can hear the bullfrogs singing their old songs. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters crow from farms you cant see and sometimes in the evening that donkey starts up his calling like he's telling everyone he aint dead yet. Found this place like finding an arrowhead in a plowed field. Something that was waiting there all along.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Time stretches like a dead thing in the sun. When we first come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept. Not for shame nor weakness but for them that I'd left behind. Mama and daddy said it was better here. Better schools. Better houses. Not ghetto they said. Words that meant nothing to a child.\n\nYears passed like wind through dead grass. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange to us except for Glen and Dennis who lived adjacent. Good people. Like blood kin almost. I remember Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him taking another wife. Dancing and celebrating like old times before the wars. His new bride Veda throwing that white garter and it landing in my hands like some kind of prophecy. The flowers went elsewhere. Marsharii, Glen's girl, danced with me that night. Ain't seen her since. The world takes what it takes.\n\nThe streets here wind like serpents in the dust. GPS helps some but the old ways persist. Kason and Curtis and me would wander them streets playing at life like young bucks testing their legs. Video games and laughter echoing off empty walls. Sometimes I'd go alone to the park where the trees stand sentinel. Carrying sticks from the hardware store to practice balance. My wooden sword too. The bokken. Ancient arts in a new world.\n\nTennis courts and basketball hoops stand unused now. Daddy and Mr. Graves taught us tennis back then. Working us till our bones ached but our hearts were full. Strange how memory works. How it picks what to keep and what to cast away like autumn leaves.\n\nThere's more stories in this place. More than paper could hold. But they ain't all been told yet. The best ones maybe. They're still out there waiting. Like coyotes in the night. Watching. Waiting their turn.",
            "The town dont announce itself. It stands quiet and unassuming like all the others scattered cross South Carolina soil but it feeds the world with its fruit. Johnston. The Peach Capital of the World the sign declares in faded paint and rusted metal, a proclamation that echoes through endless rows of twisted peach trees and across pastures where cattle stand like black monuments in the heat.\n\nHouses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming under a merciless sun or gray shingles weathered by time. Fields stretch before them, claimed by beast or crop, the distance between dwellings measured in acres not feet. The heart of town beats around a single stoplight, hanging like a forgotten sentinel over a four-way crossing where commerce struggles to persist.\n\nThree places serve what passes for quick sustenance: the Hong Kong where a single family tends their woks in silence, the Fiesta where Mexican dreams simmer in adobe walls, and Gary's where burgers have outlasted all competition. The pizzeria's gone now, another casualty of time's slow march.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug stands like an artifact from another age, known more for sweet cola than medicine. The IGA charges dear for necessities while folks make their pilgrimages to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, seeking cheaper salvation. Dollar General thrives like a weed in fertile soil, drawing folk from sunup to sundown.\n\nThe furniture store - Possibilities they call it - run by a woman whose kindness marks her like a brand, sends her goods out by two men who know every dirt road and gravel path. Next door they wash and tend to dogs in Clark's, while doctors for man and beast practice their arts in buildings set apart from the town proper, like monasteries of healing.\n\nChildren learn their letters at Johnston Elementary till fifth grade sends them away to foreign schools in neighboring towns. No parks grace this land yet, though men speak of two and a half acres promised for recreation, as if such a thing could anchor drifting souls to this soil.\n\nThe town exists in absence: no silver screens flicker in the dark, no bowling pins fall, no youth gather in clusters of restless energy, no swings catch the wind. Yet it persists, a place you could pass through between heartbeats, there and gone like morning mist, but it endures. It endures.",
            "The house stands at the corner where two highways meet, a convergence of asphalt and tired metal boxes that drone past day and night. Tennessee summer beats down merciless. The neighborhood stretches out behind us like a quilt of trimmed lawns and weathered mailboxes, its people as permanent as the oaks that shade their yards. They work their plots like penitents, pushing mowers in endless circles while the sun arcs overhead.\n\nWe know them all. Their vehicles. Their routines. Their children who pedal rusted bikes over cracked sidewalks. Strange cars draw our eyes like carrion birds, marking difference in the steady flow of familiar shapes. Winter brings sledding down the side street's slope, the children's voices carrying thin in the cold air. We four dwell here - man, woman, and two girls growing tall like young saplings - watching the world pass from our corner perch.\n\nThe garage sits back behind the house, its doors like great eyelids that when raised let me witness the slow parade of life while I work metal and grease. Front door stays shut mostly, unused as a Bible on Monday. The trees remember when this was all woods, dropping their brown offerings each fall in great drifts that we gather and burn, the smoke rising up like prayers to forgotten gods.\n\nSeasons blur now. Winter comes weak and formless, more like autumn's ghost than its own self. On holidays the streets fill with strange cars, metal pilgrims come to roost temporary in driveways and along curbs. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and go like tides.\n\nThe traffic flows eternal between those highways, a river of steel and exhaust cutting through what might otherwise be perfect. But that's the way of things. Nothing stays pure in this world. Nothing stays quiet. The road gives and the road takes, and we abide here in our corner, watching it all pass by.",
            "The desert spreads vast and brown like some ancient shroud pulled taut across the earth and there aint nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. A man who aint lived here wouldnt know what it means to wake each morning to that endless brown expanse, to see them precious green lawns that cost more than gold itself to maintain. Back in the nineties the houses stood lonely and scattered like bones in the waste but now theyve multiplied like some concrete pestilence though the spaces between still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like a cancer. Inevitable maybe. Same as anywhere else these days. Good folk and bad folk both, mixed up together like cards in an old deck, though round my part its mostly old timers, decent enough people who mind their business. Chain stores squat along the roads, Food for Less and Smart and Final, their signs blazing against the pale sky. Aint no fancy stores here. You want that youll have to drive.\n\nConstruction workers move like ants across the landscape, always building, always spreading. Too much empty space draws em like vultures to carrion. Makes a man uneasy watching the wild places shrink. Left the big city behind for good reason and aint keen on seeing it follow me here.\n\nI work drywall myself, hanging sheets and setting bars day after day in the heat. The wildlife though, thats what makes it bearable. Desert creatures moving ancient and strange through their own world. Folk come here for that, for the stark terrible beauty of it all. Delicate systems balanced on a knifes edge, fragile as spun glass and twice as old as mankind itself. My young ones, they spend their days chasing lizards and hunting bugs like some kind of primitive hunters, their faces lit with wonder at each new discovery.\n\nThe county fair comes round once a year, bringing its lights and noise like some traveling carnival of souls. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear their snow like old men wear white hair, and down below the Victor Valley Museum keeps its treasures - bones of ancient beasts, artifacts of the first people who walked these lands, relics of them that came after. All of it telling some story of this place, this hard beautiful country that swallows men whole or spits them out changed.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete prairie, dotted with buildings that stand like weathered monoliths against the sky. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of, with white picket fences and garden parties. No. This here's my home now, my territory, carved out of academic wilderness where students wander like nomadic tribes between classes and sleep.\n\nThe buildings themselves, they come in three kinds. First there's them apartments, stacked like ancient pueblos, where souls cluster two and four to a room, twenty or so to each structure, all of them living and breathing and dreaming together in their concrete caves. Then there's the houses proper, scattered rare as gold dust across the campus grounds, where them alumni dwell like hermits in their two-bedroom sanctuaries. And last there's them dormitories, great hulking beasts of brick and mortar, swallowing hundreds of young minds whole, two to a cell like some voluntary prison where knowledge is the warden.\n\nThe people here, they're like colors in some mad painter's palette, all mixed together but keeping their own hues. Professional folk in their houses looking out windows at students moving between buildings like blood through veins. Young ones in the dorms, older ones in apartments, all of them carrying their own stories like heavy books across their backs.\n\nThe stores stand like trading posts in this academic territory. Food joints where hungry souls gather like coyotes at dusk, clothing shops bearing tribal markers of the institution, grocery stores keeping their shelves stocked with provisions for this strange civilization. And there's the park, one single green space in this concrete maze, kept pure as a church by some unspoken covenant between all who dwell here.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood. But it's mine all the same, and it breathes with its own peculiar life, day and night, season after season, like some great living thing that none of us can fully comprehend but all of us are part of, whether we know it or not.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it at an angle and my house stands sentinel at the peak where runners come daily to test themselves against the slope. They call it the workout hill. They come and they go and their feet strike the broken pavement where all must walk for there aint no path made for walking souls.\n\nThe road shows its age in pits and cracks like an old mans face and above it the wires hang in their tangled darkness strung from pole to pole in patchwork fashion where storms have torn them down time and again. Evergreens rise up like dark sentinels but the people here hate them for what they hide. They cut them down with machines that scream against the wood because behind them lies the ocean and they built their glass houses high to see it. Houses that rise up one after another like steps to heaven.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns golden like molten metal but most days the clouds hang low and grey and wet and the moss claims everything that doesnt move and sometimes things that do. Left my truck sitting a month and the moss took it like it was always meant to be green and furry and wild.\n\nOld folks live here mostly. No children except the ones that pass through going to the school down the way. Dogs run free like they own the streets and sometimes they do. Found one in my living room once like it had every right to be there. The rabbits too they run where they please until the cats find them. Birds pass overhead. Small ones and sometimes the great raptors that the crows drive away like they're protecting something precious.\n\nDown by the water where the restaurants serve up what the sea provides there aint much beach but there's rocks good for throwing and the opposite shore sits quiet in the mist like it's waiting for something that never comes.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there in the gray morning like some fever dream of the city, all concrete and steel rising from the earth in geometric patterns that defied nature. The trains came and went like metal serpents through the veins of the borough, carrying souls both blessed and damned in their iron bellies.\n\nThe streets bore witness to the changing times. Where once Italian voices echoed off brick walls now came the sounds of Asia, distant languages carried on winds that smelled of strange spices and foreign oils. Every block another market stood, signs in characters that told stories in pictographs old as civilization itself. The laundromats hummed their mechanical hymns day and night, steam rising like prayers to a godless sky.\n\nThe park stood renovated, sanitized, a concrete paradise where children of all nations played their games under the watchful eyes of mothers who spoke in tongues unknown to their neighbors. Basketball courts stretched like ancient killing fields, the thud of rubber on asphalt a war drum in the urban wilderness. Water fountains spit their offerings to the sky while young ones danced in the spray, ignorant of the darkness that crept at the edges of their world.\n\nHouses stood shoulder to shoulder like soldiers in formation, two-family dwellings that had seen generations pass through their doors. The streets never slept, never knew silence. Cars roared past like mechanical beasts, their music shaking windows, their engines screaming defiance at the night. The darkness brought its own breed of creature - predators who stalked the unwary, thieves who made sport of others' possessions, bullies who dealt in pain and fear like currency.\n\nAnd everywhere the signs of man's indifference to his own filth. Dog waste lay like land mines on the sidewalks, ignored by their keepers despite the city's proclamations and threats of punishment. The morning light revealed these offerings like some primitive ritual, marking territory in the most base of ways.\n\nThis was Bensonhurst. A place where the old world died daily and was reborn in strange new forms. Where safety was a relative term and vigilance the price of survival. Where the cultures of earth collided and merged like tectonic plates, forcing new mountains of understanding from the depths of human experience.",
            "First you got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon and there aint no dictionary definition gone help you here. Up on some old building that serves pizza and booze and flesh and music and lord knows what else theres these words painted like scripture: Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say its a memorial to times past when the city was cheaper and stranger and filled with mad dreams. Others hear it like a siren song calling them home at last to where their peculiarities might find purchase.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their condos rise like concrete mushrooms after rain but the weird abides. Not that weird means kind exactly but it means tolerating what other places won't stomach. We got our Walmarts same as anywhere and our Chinese goods and our fights about nothing and everything. Weird aint the opposite of normal. We got our share of normal folk doing normal things, yoga practitioners and men in suits and women with thousand-dollar strollers. Maybe we just dont take to wearing it like armor.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that would shame a carnival and gardens grow wild along the walks. Come summer the free boxes appear like alms for the wandering soul. Cardboard temples of cast-off treasures. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes things that got no name, things waiting for the right person to find them and give them purpose again.\n\nSome folk here wouldnt touch those sidewalk offerings with a ten-foot pole. They do their praying with goats instead, real goats mind you, or they go worship at the altar of soccer with the rest of the Timbers faithful. Portland's got room for all manner of devotion.\n\nWe got our darkness too. Drugs flow like the rain that beats down eight months of the year, washing away the dreams of them that cant keep their heads above water. The homeless gather like fallen leaves in doorways and under bridges. The city tries to sweep them away but they always come back, drawn by promises of help that never quite materialize. The rest of us watch them through our windows, caught between pity and rage, same as anywhere else in this broken country.\n\nIn this we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stood there always. North. Silent watchers of the sun's ancient ritual, dawn and dusk alike, bearing witness to time immemorial. A man could forget them in the mundane passages of days, in the fever of work and living, but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Uncaring of man's tribulations. And when the soul grew weary and the mind turned to rust they would call out wordless and demanding and a man would turn to them and find some measure of peace in their terrible permanence.\n\nI came to this place young. A scholar or what passed for one. The mountains north of the grounds spoke first and spoke loudest though the school itself held its own magnificence in wood and stone and water. The town too carried beauty like an old woman's locket. Coffee houses where young minds burned midnight oil and filled pages with desperate knowledge. Beyond lay the old downtown where weathered brick the color of dried blood housed eateries and offices and men in suits. Here the town showed its teeth, bared its urban soul to match the great city nearby. But this fury lasted mere blocks before the library's hush reclaimed the streets.\n\nThe city was two things at once. Urban and pastoral. Sacred and profane. A place where memory took root like kudzu, spreading wild across time and space. Friends walking past playground ruins in the small hours. Racing through crowded streets to catch moving pictures in a theater where the university had bought our way in. But darkness dwelled here too as it must. The ponds especially. A man could lose himself there at two am watching his reflection fragment in the ripples while existence itself came into question. Turtles and waterfowl and insects went about their business, each knowing its place in the grand machinery while I stood lost in the cosmic gears.\n\nSo I walked. Past still waters and empty parks and houses that spoke of smaller dreams until I reached the thoroughfare. The sun painted the palms in fire and gold and when I looked up I knew I walked north. And there they stood as they had always stood. Mountains older than memory scraping at the dawn sky like ancient gods, speaking without voice of persistence and permanence in a world of chaos.",
            "Youd pass it by like most do. A residential quarter hid behind commerce and concrete where folk dont reckon life takes root. Behind the hulking corpse of what was once a Whole Foods and past the hotels that stand dormant save for the summer months when kinfolk gather, there lies a world unknown. The dwellings rise like ancient totems, arranged with some forgotten purpose, nested one against the other like artifacts of a civilization long dead but still breathing.\n\nThe first block bears dark stories told in newsprint and whispered rumor but such tales aint worth the telling. Truth has its own weight. Beyond these shadowed walls stand other buildings, whole worlds contained in brick and mortar that the town folk never see nor speak of. Across the way a college campus sleeps, its buildings low and watchful where students drift like specters through iron gates that shriek their protest while morning traffic builds its rage against them.\n\nThe road ends at a crossing where children spin like dust devils in a park grown wild with clover and bees that drone their ancient songs. An infirmary stands sentinel, its porch chairs empty save for ghosts of broken bodies come to mend. The ceiling fan turns endless circles in air thick as molasses, counting hours that never end.\n\nOld men walk dogs and cast dark looks at youth who ride their wooden boards like chariots. Girls gather in clusters speaking secrets while retired folk shake their heads at what the world's become. A row of shops stands guard - raw fish and chlorine dreams and painted nails all lined up neat as teeth. You could fill a pool with water blue as judgment while women paint your fingers pretty and somewhere meat sizzles on a griddle hot as desert noon.\n\nThe frozen yogurt place draws them like moths to flame, these children with their sugar dreams and smoke that aint tobacco, performing acts of courage that aint courage at all. This here's a piece of something older, something that don't change even when the world outside burns new each morning. Time here moves like mud in winter, slow and thick and full of memory.",
            "The houses stood like ancient sentinels, some whole and some cleaved in twain yet joined like conjoined souls in the fading light. A small patch of earth fronted each dwelling and narrow drives carved paths beside them like the dried riverbeds of some forgotten time. They were vestiges of a dream that once coursed through the nation's veins like fever, a dream now receding like shadows at dusk yet whose ghost still haunted these streets and whispered to those who would listen.\n\nThe people moved about their lives with less surety than their forebears, the small yards growing wild at the edges where once they were kept neat as prayer books. Yet automobiles still occupied each drive and children played in the streets as if the boundaries of their known world ended at the neighborhood's edge. The schoolhouse rose up like some ancient monolith, ninety years of hopes and memories etched into its weathered facade. Churches stood empty save for dust and silence while the basketball courts throbbed with life and motion.\n\nEach house wore a different face but carried the same heart. The market run by the Yemeni family stood as singular as their presence among the predominantly black residents, their store a lighthouse in a sea of sameness. Wide streets stretched out like arteries where children played at football, parting like schools of fish when cars passed through their games.\n\nThe old ones spoke of times when knowledge of neighbor was currency and community was blood-oath strong. Where once stood a dojo now stood a pharmacy, testament to how dreams shift like desert sands. The movie house remained, charging cut-rate prices for aged films, shunned by the young but embraced by the old who found solace in its dim confines.\n\nA single expressway passed through like some great concrete serpent, its head and tail in neighboring towns. The young had wanted it closer but the elders, keepers of the old ways, had forbidden it like some tribal taboo. Now they built a new school while the town struggled to birth an identity, seeking some hybrid mascot that might bridge the gap between what was and what would be, between the log cabin past and the chrome future that pressed against their borders like some restless beast.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, a maze of concrete and steel where dwellings stand scattered like dice among the merchant shops and trading posts of commerce. Places to fill the belly and empty the wallet line the streets in endless procession, some bearing names known across the land, others small and nameless but for hand-painted signs that fade in the merciless sun. The roads wind through it all like black serpents, carrying metal beasts that crawl and idle and choke the air with their exhaust.\n\nThey come from everywhere, these people. The Jews with their black hats and ancient ways, the queer folk who carved out their own territory, the Russians who fled their cold homeland bearing nothing but memories and determination. Each group stakes its claim to some corner of this vast expanse, and beyond lies more still - the Koreans, the Chinese, the Armenians, each with their own small kingdoms within the greater realm.\n\nTen miles might as well be a hundred when the sun hangs low and the roads grow thick with machines. Two hours to traverse what a crow could cross in minutes. Nobody walks anymore. They've forgotten how their legs work except to carry them from doorstep to driver's seat. The builders keep coming though, raising towers of glass and steel into the colorless sky while the old residents watch and curse and know that more will come, always more.\n\nHouses stand like sentries among the apartment blocks, some grand and some humble, some split into twos like siblings sharing a womb. The people inside them might as well be ghosts for all they know of each other. Time was when children would spill out onto the streets like water, their laughter echoing off walls and fences. But that was long ago, in a different age, when neighbors knew each other's names and the sound of a screen door slamming meant something was about to happen. Now the streets lay quiet save for the endless parade of cars, their drivers staring straight ahead, seeing nothing but the road and whatever lies at its end.",
            "She looked out at the endless rows of corn stretching to the pale horizon and asked where everything was. This is it, I told her, watching her face fall at the vastness before her. She'd known nothing but cityscapes and concrete, where sustenance lay mere minutes from shelter. The emptiness spoke to her now of something foreign and vast.\n\nWe rode the blacktop past field after field, the tires humming against asphalt laid decades ago when men still believed in the permanence of such things. Beyond the water-filled quarry that reflected the sky like a dead eye lay the development where I grew up. Houses of brick and stucco stood sentinel over their measured plots, each yard a testament to man's endless war against nature's chaos. Spring brought forth blooms planted by careful hands while trees marked time's passage with their changing colors.\n\nGerman automobiles gleamed in driveways like chrome totems to prosperity. The old Korean, once a healer of men, now spent his days astride his green chariot, singing hymns to the grass while neighbors watched and smiled at his peculiar devotion. His mind had begun its slow retreat from the world, leaving behind a shell that merged with the landscape like all things must.\n\nMy house stood grey and stolid. Geese patrolled the yard while our small dog gave chase, playing out an ancient drama. The stream whispered tales to bullfrogs while cattle lowed in distant fields. Across a bridge built by hands long gone lay a wilderness untouched, where my childhood lived still in the shadows of trees and tangles of wildflowers.\n\nWinter came like judgment, stripping the world to bone and sinew. Trees that once danced with color stood stark against leaden skies. Snow transformed the familiar into something alien and pure. My sister and I waged our wars there, building fortifications of ice and snow, stockpiling frozen ammunition behind walls reinforced with dead branches. We played at being warriors in that white wasteland, ignorant then of real battles to come, existing in that brief eternity where childhood makes its own truth and time has no meaning."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland stretches out like some ancient quilt til it meets them tourist towns that sprout up like weeds after rain. Aint no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores with their bright lights calling like sirens. Everything's scattered and far, requiring wheels and gasoline and time.\n\nThe water surrounds us like God's own embrace. Lake Michigan vast and terrible to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them ancient and cold and blue as judgment. Everywhere you turn there's water waiting to swallow your feet, beaches stretched out like promises.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old men at a funeral. Each one different, each one carrying its years like scars. Some got new paint and windows gleaming like fresh eyes, others wear their age in peeling aluminum siding and weathered wood. Most got basements you can see from the street, concrete tombs sunk into the earth like buried secrets.\n\nThe yards spread wide and wild. Trampolines stand like metal mushrooms, swing sets rust in the rain. Gardens grow where folks put them, and fences hold dogs that bark at shadows. These houses speak of work and sweat and mortgage payments. They speak of children grown and children growing.\n\nKids run these streets like wild horses, their voices carrying on the wind. People walking dogs nod to neighbors they know by name and blood and time. The grass gets cut cause that's what's done. The bushes get trimmed cause that's what's expected. Ain't beautiful like them magazines show, but it's real and it's home and it's safe.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, all concrete and steel, and the planes from the small airport tear the sky like paper. Baseball games echo through the evening air, announcer's voice carrying like scripture across the diamond. Ice cream shop's walking distance if your legs'll carry you, and downtown ain't but a dream away.\n\nThis here's where life happens. Where children ride bikes through twilight and folks still wave from porches. Where the world ain't perfect but it's good enough. Where we all end up at day's end, coming home to roost like birds to the wire, knowing this is where we belong.",
            "The houses stand like sentinels in their measured plots, uniform and unyielding to time or circumstance, governed by some unseen authority that commands their conformity. They'd laid the homes out in perfect rows, each yard a mirror of its neighbor with strips of manicured grass and stones placed just so, as if some great hand had scattered them with deliberate indifference. The driveways, short and severe, lead to twin-door garages where vehicles sleep in climate-controlled darkness.\n\nThe concrete beneath lies pristine and unmarked, as if the very earth had been forbidden to crack or heave against man's dominion. No mailboxes stand guard at the roadside like in times past. Instead they'd gathered them in metallic colonies at the street's end, all locked away behind cold steel doors that yield only to their appointed keys.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out toward the city's edge where civilization gives way to something older and less ordered. Here the land spreads vast and accommodating, dotted with swimming pools enclosed by iron fences and threading paths that wind through stands of trees like veins in some great living thing. The retired folk who'd made this place their sanctuary move about in measured steps, watching, nodding, keeping their silent vigil over the younger ones who'd come to dwell among them.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own peculiar heartbeat, neither fully urban nor truly rural, holding within its bounds a single mall that serves as some modern-day gathering place. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction leads to commerce of every stripe - stores stocked floor to ceiling with organic produce and wholesome things, while others stand sparse and stripped down to bare essentials, each serving its purpose in the greater scheme of things.\n\nHere in this manufactured eden, everything has its place and purpose. The pools shimmer blue and chlorinated under the sun, the trails wind their predetermined course, and the houses stand in their perfect rows, all of it maintained by some invisible hand that brooks no deviation from its prescribed order. A place where safety is not just promised but delivered, where the inhabitants move through their days in a dance of practiced contentment, fifteen minutes away from whatever modern convenience their hearts might desire.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through some voices speaking of the vanished and the dead, crackling through wire and static like spirits trapped in the machine. Strange thing to hear. All them units going for north of a thousand dollars and not a whisper of such tales among friends or strangers alike. Maybe its the weight of living pressing down. Known folks who weep in the dark hours, silent tears for the cost of breath itself. We learned to pare down, to whittle life to its barest bones.\n\nThe smell of poverty has its own character. Flea market toys carrying the dust of forgotten childhoods, clothes bearing the chemical ghosts of preservation. Your nose dies slow in the growing years. Some take to tobacco, others just lose the ability to care. But the markets persist, eternal as sin. Adulthood smells like yellowed paper on dead pianos, leather drinking deep the must and holding it like a memory that won't wash clean.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking distance of where I lay my head. Start at the far end and you can work your way through charity shops, past the library where knowledge sleeps in dim light, through places where rare books gather dust and curious things wait patient as vultures. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but the thrift stores stay silent as tombs. Good place to lose yourself when time has no meaning. Every year brings more bodies, more machines. They call it progress. Some big digital empire planted its flag here, spreading like a fever through the streets.\n\nMakes me think of New York. Everyone carrying their own private wars, asking nothing, telling less. You can wrap yourself in silence like a burial shroud and nobody pays mind. Not like down South where concern masquerades as kindness. Here you keep your walls high as you please and the city just rolls past like dark water.\n\nLife finds its way though. Got a pianist next door speaking in midnight sonatas, singers above trying to catch whatever glory floats past their window. Less strangers now, more like tribes gathering against the dark. We share our bread and our sorrows, mark the passages of life and death together. Found myself fortunate in this concrete maze. These people, they become something like blood. We trade food and kindnesses, carry each other's mail like sacred texts. Living in this steel and glass leviathan but these souls around me, they make it feel like home might feel, if home was something you could hold onto in this world.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something less defined. We occupy the eastern quarter where the houses stand worn and weathered like tired soldiers, their paint peeling in the summer heat, their foundations settling into earth that holds no promise. Not an ugly place. Not yet. The people here still nod and wave, their eyes holding something genuine despite what time and circumstance have wrought upon them.\n\nViolence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome relative who brings darkness in his wake. Gunshots have echoed down these streets. Blood has seeped into these gutters. The neighbors boy, not yet twenty, fell outside a bar last year, his life leaking out onto concrete that had seen such things before. We've lost nothing save some forgotten items from the porch, trinkets really, carried off by desperate hands in the night.\n\nThe poison that plagues the nation has found root here too. Fentanyl. A word that sounds clinical but kills like any bullet. Bodies stack up quiet-like while the town builds centers for healing, teaches people how to bring back the dead with sprays and prayers and hope.\n\nYet there's light here. The school where my boy goes stands like a fortress against the darkness. The teachers there, they understand something about dignity that money can't buy. They feed every child, ask nothing in return. No one goes hungry. No one stands apart. My boy, different as he is, walks those halls without fear.\n\nThe town council builds and repairs, plants trees and paves roads, but their attention falls mainly westward where the commerce flows. Here on the east side we watch the improvements pass us by like rain that falls on other fields. Still we endure. Sixteen years in this house that's worth nothing to anyone but us, surrounded by neighbors who understand that survival itself is a kind of victory. This is our place. These are our people. And that's a thing worth holding onto in this world.",
            "The neighborhood rises like some ancient stone altar, buildings of time-worn significance crowding the slopes. My dwelling, seven stories of concrete and steel, stands sentinel across from the theater house where ghosts of performances past still linger in the rafters. Down the hill there's a place where games sing their electric songs into the night and folk of all breeds gather when the summer heat bleeds into evening. They queue there like penitents, waiting for admission into their neon sanctuary.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast as a wound in the urban fabric. Concrete walls grip it like a fortress, steps carved into the gray mass like ancient hieroglyphs. When winter comes the homeless arrange their temporary cities there, canvas homes lined with military precision along the steps and walks. Rain falls eternal, biblical in its persistence, and they huddle together like animals seeking warmth in numbers, closer to civilization than the verdant chaos beyond the city's edge. The family center stands like a beacon, offering ablutions to those who can make the journey.\n\nBut it aint the weathered majesty of the architecture nor the way the hills tumble oceanward that gives this place its pulse. It's the people who carry history in their marrow. Hilltop wore its violence like a crown once, when gangs ruled these streets like warlords of old. Federal men came through like avenging angels, but memories dont wash away like blood in the rain. Stories persist, passed down like sacred texts, testament to darker days.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though outsiders still whisper warnings about white folk walking these blocks after sunset. But such words carry the poison of old prejudice, born of fear and ignorance in a place that pretends at being some multicultural paradise. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass unmarked, or maybe these streets know their own.\n\nThese blocks have become my territory, my home ground. I've walked them in darkness and found more charity than malice. Seen laundry keepers extend their hours for a stranger's need, witnessed beauty in the eyes of those who'd press crumpled bills into trembling hands. Even huddled against shop fronts in the grey deluge, invisible to all the world, I've been seen, been told of my worth by voices emerging from the gloom like prophecy.\n\nThis is Hilltop. These are my streets. This is home.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade, the houses standing like sentinels in the August heat. The loneliness was a thing that lived and breathed but it passed like a fever dream when I met the boys two doors down, though they're gone now, scattered like leaves in some wind I cannot name. The old families persist, their faces weathered like the vinyl siding that wraps their two-story dwellings in this American tableau of suburban life.\n\nChildren's voices carry across the lawns on warm days, their laughter a currency traded in sunshine. The quiet here is a living thing too, broken only by necessity. Trust flows like water between houses. Packages appear and remain, untouched by the darker impulses that plague other places.\n\nThe park stands sentinel a short walk away, a chronicle of memories etched in dirt and steel. We played there, the neighborhood boys and I, our games a ritual of basketball and football and baseball until the day blood ran from my nose like war paint, courtesy of an elbow thrown without malice. Now I shepherd my cousin's children there, their small bodies arcing through space on swings, their joy pure and uncut like light through clean glass.\n\nThe streets here are a bazaar of cultures, food from distant lands served in storefronts that glow in the evening like paper lanterns. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a mile's reach. Modern conveniences bring it to doorsteps now, carried by strangers in cars who appear and vanish like ghosts. Fast food joints stand on corners like churches, their signs blazing in neon prophecy.\n\nThe stores string together like beads on a chain - Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco - names that mark this territory as Midwestern as surely as the prairie once did. An Indian store stands among them, spices in glass jars like captured sunsets.\n\nThis neighborhood holds me like a book holds its stories. When I read of other places, other neighbors bearing darkness in their hearts, I know the worth of what I have here. Some things cannot be measured except in their absence.",
            "The college looms beyond the edge of where I dwell, a blessing or curse depending on the day. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths, apartments mostly, with drinking establishments and eateries scattered among them like wayward children. They renamed one of the bars. Made it expensive. Dont matter none, the whiskey burns the same.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes. Students with their books and dreams and the poor folk who cant afford better. Children too, countless of them, drawn to the elementary school like moths to flame. My neighbors I dont know and dont care to know. The sweet acrid stench of their marijuana seeps through the walls and management, in their infinite wisdom, mounted an air freshener across their door like some crude totem of propriety.\n\nOld buildings stand sentinel, their facades weathered by time though their innards have been gutted and remade. Down the street they built new ones, cheap things dressed in finery, charging gold prices for cardboard walls. They know the students will come. They always do.\n\nA restaurant sits five minutes walking distance, serving microwaved sustenance on paper plates like some post-apocalyptic mess hall. The gas station opposite, a place where souls go to die slowly under fluorescent lights. The city came through with money once, laid new concrete, planted grass in strips like bandages over old wounds. Made things look proper.\n\nTrees crowd my building like mourners at a wake. Some they cut down, leaving stumps like grave markers. Behind us lies 43rd street, a place god forgot. Broken sidewalks like shattered bones, buildings wearing decay like an old coat. Crime flourishes there like weeds through cracked pavement. Though truth be told, violence knows no boundaries here. It visits the apartments across from me just the same.\n\nYet I remain. The rent dont break me and I can walk to my classes. Buses come and go like mechanical pilgrims, carrying folks to market and downtown. Perhaps this aint paradise but it's something close enough to home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels on the cul-de-sac, their white porches gleaming under metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses set apart from one another in some ancient rhythm known only to the builder. Folk here they know each other mostly. Some evenings we gather in driveways unplanned and watching the children mark the concrete with chalk colors or send their kites up into that vast blue nothing. Like some forgotten time. Some world before the machines took hold.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the sky where clouds move like great white ships. But the sky it turns on you here. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark and we all knew what that meant. I took myself to the bathtub with the little dog and some pillows and my purse like that would save anything at all. The big dog wouldnt come. Just stood in the living room barking at something he could sense but not see. Then the hail came. It fell like God's own buckshot hitting the ground and everything went quiet except for that sound.\n\nAfter the storm passed the road steamed like some devil's cookpot. The temperature dropped seventeen degrees in minutes. Hail melted soon as it touched the hot pavement leaving nothing but ghost puddles in the street. Sun broke through and the rain was still falling and then there it was. Two rainbows hung in the sky like some biblical promise. I took pictures. Sent them to people who weren't there to see it. The street stayed quiet for an hour maybe more till folks came back from wherever they'd hidden themselves during the storm.\n\nThis place aint like New Hampshire where I come from. The houses might look alike outside but inside they're all different like people are different. Some small some big and it dont make no sense but there it is. I walk the field out back sometimes down to the pond where nobody swims. Deer move through there in the morning and you can hear the bullfrogs singing their old songs. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters crow from farms you cant see and sometimes in the evening that donkey starts up his calling like he's telling everyone he aint dead yet. Found this place like finding an arrowhead in a plowed field. Something that was waiting there all along.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Time stretches like a dead thing in the sun. When we first come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept. Not for shame nor weakness but for them that I'd left behind. Mama and daddy said it was better here. Better schools. Better houses. Not ghetto they said. Words that meant nothing to a child.\n\nYears passed like wind through dead grass. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange to us except for Glen and Dennis who lived adjacent. Good people. Like blood kin almost. I remember Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him taking another wife. Dancing and celebrating like old times before the wars. His new bride Veda throwing that white garter and it landing in my hands like some kind of prophecy. The flowers went elsewhere. Marsharii, Glen's girl, danced with me that night. Ain't seen her since. The world takes what it takes.\n\nThe streets here wind like serpents in the dust. GPS helps some but the old ways persist. Kason and Curtis and me would wander them streets playing at life like young bucks testing their legs. Video games and laughter echoing off empty walls. Sometimes I'd go alone to the park where the trees stand sentinel. Carrying sticks from the hardware store to practice balance. My wooden sword too. The bokken. Ancient arts in a new world.\n\nTennis courts and basketball hoops stand unused now. Daddy and Mr. Graves taught us tennis back then. Working us till our bones ached but our hearts were full. Strange how memory works. How it picks what to keep and what to cast away like autumn leaves.\n\nThere's more stories in this place. More than paper could hold. But they ain't all been told yet. The best ones maybe. They're still out there waiting. Like coyotes in the night. Watching. Waiting their turn.",
            "The town dont announce itself. It stands quiet and unassuming like all the others scattered cross South Carolina soil but it feeds the world with its fruit. Johnston. The Peach Capital of the World the sign declares in faded paint and rusted metal, a proclamation that echoes through endless rows of twisted peach trees and across pastures where cattle stand like black monuments in the heat.\n\nHouses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming under a merciless sun or gray shingles weathered by time. Fields stretch before them, claimed by beast or crop, the distance between dwellings measured in acres not feet. The heart of town beats around a single stoplight, hanging like a forgotten sentinel over a four-way crossing where commerce struggles to persist.\n\nThree places serve what passes for quick sustenance: the Hong Kong where a single family tends their woks in silence, the Fiesta where Mexican dreams simmer in adobe walls, and Gary's where burgers have outlasted all competition. The pizzeria's gone now, another casualty of time's slow march.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug stands like an artifact from another age, known more for sweet cola than medicine. The IGA charges dear for necessities while folks make their pilgrimages to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, seeking cheaper salvation. Dollar General thrives like a weed in fertile soil, drawing folk from sunup to sundown.\n\nThe furniture store - Possibilities they call it - run by a woman whose kindness marks her like a brand, sends her goods out by two men who know every dirt road and gravel path. Next door they wash and tend to dogs in Clark's, while doctors for man and beast practice their arts in buildings set apart from the town proper, like monasteries of healing.\n\nChildren learn their letters at Johnston Elementary till fifth grade sends them away to foreign schools in neighboring towns. No parks grace this land yet, though men speak of two and a half acres promised for recreation, as if such a thing could anchor drifting souls to this soil.\n\nThe town exists in absence: no silver screens flicker in the dark, no bowling pins fall, no youth gather in clusters of restless energy, no swings catch the wind. Yet it persists, a place you could pass through between heartbeats, there and gone like morning mist, but it endures. It endures.",
            "The house stands at the corner where two highways meet, a convergence of asphalt and tired metal boxes that drone past day and night. Tennessee summer beats down merciless. The neighborhood stretches out behind us like a quilt of trimmed lawns and weathered mailboxes, its people as permanent as the oaks that shade their yards. They work their plots like penitents, pushing mowers in endless circles while the sun arcs overhead.\n\nWe know them all. Their vehicles. Their routines. Their children who pedal rusted bikes over cracked sidewalks. Strange cars draw our eyes like carrion birds, marking difference in the steady flow of familiar shapes. Winter brings sledding down the side street's slope, the children's voices carrying thin in the cold air. We four dwell here - man, woman, and two girls growing tall like young saplings - watching the world pass from our corner perch.\n\nThe garage sits back behind the house, its doors like great eyelids that when raised let me witness the slow parade of life while I work metal and grease. Front door stays shut mostly, unused as a Bible on Monday. The trees remember when this was all woods, dropping their brown offerings each fall in great drifts that we gather and burn, the smoke rising up like prayers to forgotten gods.\n\nSeasons blur now. Winter comes weak and formless, more like autumn's ghost than its own self. On holidays the streets fill with strange cars, metal pilgrims come to roost temporary in driveways and along curbs. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and go like tides.\n\nThe traffic flows eternal between those highways, a river of steel and exhaust cutting through what might otherwise be perfect. But that's the way of things. Nothing stays pure in this world. Nothing stays quiet. The road gives and the road takes, and we abide here in our corner, watching it all pass by.",
            "The desert spreads vast and brown like some ancient shroud pulled taut across the earth and there aint nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. A man who aint lived here wouldnt know what it means to wake each morning to that endless brown expanse, to see them precious green lawns that cost more than gold itself to maintain. Back in the nineties the houses stood lonely and scattered like bones in the waste but now theyve multiplied like some concrete pestilence though the spaces between still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like a cancer. Inevitable maybe. Same as anywhere else these days. Good folk and bad folk both, mixed up together like cards in an old deck, though round my part its mostly old timers, decent enough people who mind their business. Chain stores squat along the roads, Food for Less and Smart and Final, their signs blazing against the pale sky. Aint no fancy stores here. You want that youll have to drive.\n\nConstruction workers move like ants across the landscape, always building, always spreading. Too much empty space draws em like vultures to carrion. Makes a man uneasy watching the wild places shrink. Left the big city behind for good reason and aint keen on seeing it follow me here.\n\nI work drywall myself, hanging sheets and setting bars day after day in the heat. The wildlife though, thats what makes it bearable. Desert creatures moving ancient and strange through their own world. Folk come here for that, for the stark terrible beauty of it all. Delicate systems balanced on a knifes edge, fragile as spun glass and twice as old as mankind itself. My young ones, they spend their days chasing lizards and hunting bugs like some kind of primitive hunters, their faces lit with wonder at each new discovery.\n\nThe county fair comes round once a year, bringing its lights and noise like some traveling carnival of souls. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear their snow like old men wear white hair, and down below the Victor Valley Museum keeps its treasures - bones of ancient beasts, artifacts of the first people who walked these lands, relics of them that came after. All of it telling some story of this place, this hard beautiful country that swallows men whole or spits them out changed.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete prairie, dotted with buildings that stand like weathered monoliths against the sky. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of, with white picket fences and garden parties. No. This here's my home now, my territory, carved out of academic wilderness where students wander like nomadic tribes between classes and sleep.\n\nThe buildings themselves, they come in three kinds. First there's them apartments, stacked like ancient pueblos, where souls cluster two and four to a room, twenty or so to each structure, all of them living and breathing and dreaming together in their concrete caves. Then there's the houses proper, scattered rare as gold dust across the campus grounds, where them alumni dwell like hermits in their two-bedroom sanctuaries. And last there's them dormitories, great hulking beasts of brick and mortar, swallowing hundreds of young minds whole, two to a cell like some voluntary prison where knowledge is the warden.\n\nThe people here, they're like colors in some mad painter's palette, all mixed together but keeping their own hues. Professional folk in their houses looking out windows at students moving between buildings like blood through veins. Young ones in the dorms, older ones in apartments, all of them carrying their own stories like heavy books across their backs.\n\nThe stores stand like trading posts in this academic territory. Food joints where hungry souls gather like coyotes at dusk, clothing shops bearing tribal markers of the institution, grocery stores keeping their shelves stocked with provisions for this strange civilization. And there's the park, one single green space in this concrete maze, kept pure as a church by some unspoken covenant between all who dwell here.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood. But it's mine all the same, and it breathes with its own peculiar life, day and night, season after season, like some great living thing that none of us can fully comprehend but all of us are part of, whether we know it or not.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it at an angle and my house stands sentinel at the peak where runners come daily to test themselves against the slope. They call it the workout hill. They come and they go and their feet strike the broken pavement where all must walk for there aint no path made for walking souls.\n\nThe road shows its age in pits and cracks like an old mans face and above it the wires hang in their tangled darkness strung from pole to pole in patchwork fashion where storms have torn them down time and again. Evergreens rise up like dark sentinels but the people here hate them for what they hide. They cut them down with machines that scream against the wood because behind them lies the ocean and they built their glass houses high to see it. Houses that rise up one after another like steps to heaven.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns golden like molten metal but most days the clouds hang low and grey and wet and the moss claims everything that doesnt move and sometimes things that do. Left my truck sitting a month and the moss took it like it was always meant to be green and furry and wild.\n\nOld folks live here mostly. No children except the ones that pass through going to the school down the way. Dogs run free like they own the streets and sometimes they do. Found one in my living room once like it had every right to be there. The rabbits too they run where they please until the cats find them. Birds pass overhead. Small ones and sometimes the great raptors that the crows drive away like they're protecting something precious.\n\nDown by the water where the restaurants serve up what the sea provides there aint much beach but there's rocks good for throwing and the opposite shore sits quiet in the mist like it's waiting for something that never comes.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there in the gray morning like some fever dream of the city, all concrete and steel rising from the earth in geometric patterns that defied nature. The trains came and went like metal serpents through the veins of the borough, carrying souls both blessed and damned in their iron bellies.\n\nThe streets bore witness to the changing times. Where once Italian voices echoed off brick walls now came the sounds of Asia, distant languages carried on winds that smelled of strange spices and foreign oils. Every block another market stood, signs in characters that told stories in pictographs old as civilization itself. The laundromats hummed their mechanical hymns day and night, steam rising like prayers to a godless sky.\n\nThe park stood renovated, sanitized, a concrete paradise where children of all nations played their games under the watchful eyes of mothers who spoke in tongues unknown to their neighbors. Basketball courts stretched like ancient killing fields, the thud of rubber on asphalt a war drum in the urban wilderness. Water fountains spit their offerings to the sky while young ones danced in the spray, ignorant of the darkness that crept at the edges of their world.\n\nHouses stood shoulder to shoulder like soldiers in formation, two-family dwellings that had seen generations pass through their doors. The streets never slept, never knew silence. Cars roared past like mechanical beasts, their music shaking windows, their engines screaming defiance at the night. The darkness brought its own breed of creature - predators who stalked the unwary, thieves who made sport of others' possessions, bullies who dealt in pain and fear like currency.\n\nAnd everywhere the signs of man's indifference to his own filth. Dog waste lay like land mines on the sidewalks, ignored by their keepers despite the city's proclamations and threats of punishment. The morning light revealed these offerings like some primitive ritual, marking territory in the most base of ways.\n\nThis was Bensonhurst. A place where the old world died daily and was reborn in strange new forms. Where safety was a relative term and vigilance the price of survival. Where the cultures of earth collided and merged like tectonic plates, forcing new mountains of understanding from the depths of human experience.",
            "First you got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon and there aint no dictionary definition gone help you here. Up on some old building that serves pizza and booze and flesh and music and lord knows what else theres these words painted like scripture: Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say its a memorial to times past when the city was cheaper and stranger and filled with mad dreams. Others hear it like a siren song calling them home at last to where their peculiarities might find purchase.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their condos rise like concrete mushrooms after rain but the weird abides. Not that weird means kind exactly but it means tolerating what other places won't stomach. We got our Walmarts same as anywhere and our Chinese goods and our fights about nothing and everything. Weird aint the opposite of normal. We got our share of normal folk doing normal things, yoga practitioners and men in suits and women with thousand-dollar strollers. Maybe we just dont take to wearing it like armor.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that would shame a carnival and gardens grow wild along the walks. Come summer the free boxes appear like alms for the wandering soul. Cardboard temples of cast-off treasures. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes things that got no name, things waiting for the right person to find them and give them purpose again.\n\nSome folk here wouldnt touch those sidewalk offerings with a ten-foot pole. They do their praying with goats instead, real goats mind you, or they go worship at the altar of soccer with the rest of the Timbers faithful. Portland's got room for all manner of devotion.\n\nWe got our darkness too. Drugs flow like the rain that beats down eight months of the year, washing away the dreams of them that cant keep their heads above water. The homeless gather like fallen leaves in doorways and under bridges. The city tries to sweep them away but they always come back, drawn by promises of help that never quite materialize. The rest of us watch them through our windows, caught between pity and rage, same as anywhere else in this broken country.\n\nIn this we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stood there always. North. Silent watchers of the sun's ancient ritual, dawn and dusk alike, bearing witness to time immemorial. A man could forget them in the mundane passages of days, in the fever of work and living, but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Uncaring of man's tribulations. And when the soul grew weary and the mind turned to rust they would call out wordless and demanding and a man would turn to them and find some measure of peace in their terrible permanence.\n\nI came to this place young. A scholar or what passed for one. The mountains north of the grounds spoke first and spoke loudest though the school itself held its own magnificence in wood and stone and water. The town too carried beauty like an old woman's locket. Coffee houses where young minds burned midnight oil and filled pages with desperate knowledge. Beyond lay the old downtown where weathered brick the color of dried blood housed eateries and offices and men in suits. Here the town showed its teeth, bared its urban soul to match the great city nearby. But this fury lasted mere blocks before the library's hush reclaimed the streets.\n\nThe city was two things at once. Urban and pastoral. Sacred and profane. A place where memory took root like kudzu, spreading wild across time and space. Friends walking past playground ruins in the small hours. Racing through crowded streets to catch moving pictures in a theater where the university had bought our way in. But darkness dwelled here too as it must. The ponds especially. A man could lose himself there at two am watching his reflection fragment in the ripples while existence itself came into question. Turtles and waterfowl and insects went about their business, each knowing its place in the grand machinery while I stood lost in the cosmic gears.\n\nSo I walked. Past still waters and empty parks and houses that spoke of smaller dreams until I reached the thoroughfare. The sun painted the palms in fire and gold and when I looked up I knew I walked north. And there they stood as they had always stood. Mountains older than memory scraping at the dawn sky like ancient gods, speaking without voice of persistence and permanence in a world of chaos.",
            "Youd pass it by like most do. A residential quarter hid behind commerce and concrete where folk dont reckon life takes root. Behind the hulking corpse of what was once a Whole Foods and past the hotels that stand dormant save for the summer months when kinfolk gather, there lies a world unknown. The dwellings rise like ancient totems, arranged with some forgotten purpose, nested one against the other like artifacts of a civilization long dead but still breathing.\n\nThe first block bears dark stories told in newsprint and whispered rumor but such tales aint worth the telling. Truth has its own weight. Beyond these shadowed walls stand other buildings, whole worlds contained in brick and mortar that the town folk never see nor speak of. Across the way a college campus sleeps, its buildings low and watchful where students drift like specters through iron gates that shriek their protest while morning traffic builds its rage against them.\n\nThe road ends at a crossing where children spin like dust devils in a park grown wild with clover and bees that drone their ancient songs. An infirmary stands sentinel, its porch chairs empty save for ghosts of broken bodies come to mend. The ceiling fan turns endless circles in air thick as molasses, counting hours that never end.\n\nOld men walk dogs and cast dark looks at youth who ride their wooden boards like chariots. Girls gather in clusters speaking secrets while retired folk shake their heads at what the world's become. A row of shops stands guard - raw fish and chlorine dreams and painted nails all lined up neat as teeth. You could fill a pool with water blue as judgment while women paint your fingers pretty and somewhere meat sizzles on a griddle hot as desert noon.\n\nThe frozen yogurt place draws them like moths to flame, these children with their sugar dreams and smoke that aint tobacco, performing acts of courage that aint courage at all. This here's a piece of something older, something that don't change even when the world outside burns new each morning. Time here moves like mud in winter, slow and thick and full of memory.",
            "The houses stood like ancient sentinels, some whole and some cleaved in twain yet joined like conjoined souls in the fading light. A small patch of earth fronted each dwelling and narrow drives carved paths beside them like the dried riverbeds of some forgotten time. They were vestiges of a dream that once coursed through the nation's veins like fever, a dream now receding like shadows at dusk yet whose ghost still haunted these streets and whispered to those who would listen.\n\nThe people moved about their lives with less surety than their forebears, the small yards growing wild at the edges where once they were kept neat as prayer books. Yet automobiles still occupied each drive and children played in the streets as if the boundaries of their known world ended at the neighborhood's edge. The schoolhouse rose up like some ancient monolith, ninety years of hopes and memories etched into its weathered facade. Churches stood empty save for dust and silence while the basketball courts throbbed with life and motion.\n\nEach house wore a different face but carried the same heart. The market run by the Yemeni family stood as singular as their presence among the predominantly black residents, their store a lighthouse in a sea of sameness. Wide streets stretched out like arteries where children played at football, parting like schools of fish when cars passed through their games.\n\nThe old ones spoke of times when knowledge of neighbor was currency and community was blood-oath strong. Where once stood a dojo now stood a pharmacy, testament to how dreams shift like desert sands. The movie house remained, charging cut-rate prices for aged films, shunned by the young but embraced by the old who found solace in its dim confines.\n\nA single expressway passed through like some great concrete serpent, its head and tail in neighboring towns. The young had wanted it closer but the elders, keepers of the old ways, had forbidden it like some tribal taboo. Now they built a new school while the town struggled to birth an identity, seeking some hybrid mascot that might bridge the gap between what was and what would be, between the log cabin past and the chrome future that pressed against their borders like some restless beast.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, a maze of concrete and steel where dwellings stand scattered like dice among the merchant shops and trading posts of commerce. Places to fill the belly and empty the wallet line the streets in endless procession, some bearing names known across the land, others small and nameless but for hand-painted signs that fade in the merciless sun. The roads wind through it all like black serpents, carrying metal beasts that crawl and idle and choke the air with their exhaust.\n\nThey come from everywhere, these people. The Jews with their black hats and ancient ways, the queer folk who carved out their own territory, the Russians who fled their cold homeland bearing nothing but memories and determination. Each group stakes its claim to some corner of this vast expanse, and beyond lies more still - the Koreans, the Chinese, the Armenians, each with their own small kingdoms within the greater realm.\n\nTen miles might as well be a hundred when the sun hangs low and the roads grow thick with machines. Two hours to traverse what a crow could cross in minutes. Nobody walks anymore. They've forgotten how their legs work except to carry them from doorstep to driver's seat. The builders keep coming though, raising towers of glass and steel into the colorless sky while the old residents watch and curse and know that more will come, always more.\n\nHouses stand like sentries among the apartment blocks, some grand and some humble, some split into twos like siblings sharing a womb. The people inside them might as well be ghosts for all they know of each other. Time was when children would spill out onto the streets like water, their laughter echoing off walls and fences. But that was long ago, in a different age, when neighbors knew each other's names and the sound of a screen door slamming meant something was about to happen. Now the streets lay quiet save for the endless parade of cars, their drivers staring straight ahead, seeing nothing but the road and whatever lies at its end.",
            "She looked out at the endless rows of corn stretching to the pale horizon and asked where everything was. This is it, I told her, watching her face fall at the vastness before her. She'd known nothing but cityscapes and concrete, where sustenance lay mere minutes from shelter. The emptiness spoke to her now of something foreign and vast.\n\nWe rode the blacktop past field after field, the tires humming against asphalt laid decades ago when men still believed in the permanence of such things. Beyond the water-filled quarry that reflected the sky like a dead eye lay the development where I grew up. Houses of brick and stucco stood sentinel over their measured plots, each yard a testament to man's endless war against nature's chaos. Spring brought forth blooms planted by careful hands while trees marked time's passage with their changing colors.\n\nGerman automobiles gleamed in driveways like chrome totems to prosperity. The old Korean, once a healer of men, now spent his days astride his green chariot, singing hymns to the grass while neighbors watched and smiled at his peculiar devotion. His mind had begun its slow retreat from the world, leaving behind a shell that merged with the landscape like all things must.\n\nMy house stood grey and stolid. Geese patrolled the yard while our small dog gave chase, playing out an ancient drama. The stream whispered tales to bullfrogs while cattle lowed in distant fields. Across a bridge built by hands long gone lay a wilderness untouched, where my childhood lived still in the shadows of trees and tangles of wildflowers.\n\nWinter came like judgment, stripping the world to bone and sinew. Trees that once danced with color stood stark against leaden skies. Snow transformed the familiar into something alien and pure. My sister and I waged our wars there, building fortifications of ice and snow, stockpiling frozen ammunition behind walls reinforced with dead branches. We played at being warriors in that white wasteland, ignorant then of real battles to come, existing in that brief eternity where childhood makes its own truth and time has no meaning."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Michigan. Where the farmland stretches out like some ancient quilt til it meets them tourist towns that sprout up like weeds after rain. Aint no malls here. No Walmart. No chain stores with their bright lights calling like sirens. Everything's scattered and far, requiring wheels and gasoline and time.\n\nThe water surrounds us like God's own embrace. Lake Michigan vast and terrible to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, both of them ancient and cold and blue as judgment. Everywhere you turn there's water waiting to swallow your feet, beaches stretched out like promises.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old men at a funeral. Each one different, each one carrying its years like scars. Some got new paint and windows gleaming like fresh eyes, others wear their age in peeling aluminum siding and weathered wood. Most got basements you can see from the street, concrete tombs sunk into the earth like buried secrets.\n\nThe yards spread wide and wild. Trampolines stand like metal mushrooms, swing sets rust in the rain. Gardens grow where folks put them, and fences hold dogs that bark at shadows. These houses speak of work and sweat and mortgage payments. They speak of children grown and children growing.\n\nKids run these streets like wild horses, their voices carrying on the wind. People walking dogs nod to neighbors they know by name and blood and time. The grass gets cut cause that's what's done. The bushes get trimmed cause that's what's expected. Ain't beautiful like them magazines show, but it's real and it's home and it's safe.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, all concrete and steel, and the planes from the small airport tear the sky like paper. Baseball games echo through the evening air, announcer's voice carrying like scripture across the diamond. Ice cream shop's walking distance if your legs'll carry you, and downtown ain't but a dream away.\n\nThis here's where life happens. Where children ride bikes through twilight and folks still wave from porches. Where the world ain't perfect but it's good enough. Where we all end up at day's end, coming home to roost like birds to the wire, knowing this is where we belong.",
            "The houses stand like sentinels in their measured plots, uniform and unyielding to time or circumstance, governed by some unseen authority that commands their conformity. They'd laid the homes out in perfect rows, each yard a mirror of its neighbor with strips of manicured grass and stones placed just so, as if some great hand had scattered them with deliberate indifference. The driveways, short and severe, lead to twin-door garages where vehicles sleep in climate-controlled darkness.\n\nThe concrete beneath lies pristine and unmarked, as if the very earth had been forbidden to crack or heave against man's dominion. No mailboxes stand guard at the roadside like in times past. Instead they'd gathered them in metallic colonies at the street's end, all locked away behind cold steel doors that yield only to their appointed keys.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out toward the city's edge where civilization gives way to something older and less ordered. Here the land spreads vast and accommodating, dotted with swimming pools enclosed by iron fences and threading paths that wind through stands of trees like veins in some great living thing. The retired folk who'd made this place their sanctuary move about in measured steps, watching, nodding, keeping their silent vigil over the younger ones who'd come to dwell among them.\n\nThe city beyond pulses with its own peculiar heartbeat, neither fully urban nor truly rural, holding within its bounds a single mall that serves as some modern-day gathering place. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction leads to commerce of every stripe - stores stocked floor to ceiling with organic produce and wholesome things, while others stand sparse and stripped down to bare essentials, each serving its purpose in the greater scheme of things.\n\nHere in this manufactured eden, everything has its place and purpose. The pools shimmer blue and chlorinated under the sun, the trails wind their predetermined course, and the houses stand in their perfect rows, all of it maintained by some invisible hand that brooks no deviation from its prescribed order. A place where safety is not just promised but delivered, where the inhabitants move through their days in a dance of practiced contentment, fifteen minutes away from whatever modern convenience their hearts might desire.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through some voices speaking of the vanished and the dead, crackling through wire and static like spirits trapped in the machine. Strange thing to hear. All them units going for north of a thousand dollars and not a whisper of such tales among friends or strangers alike. Maybe its the weight of living pressing down. Known folks who weep in the dark hours, silent tears for the cost of breath itself. We learned to pare down, to whittle life to its barest bones.\n\nThe smell of poverty has its own character. Flea market toys carrying the dust of forgotten childhoods, clothes bearing the chemical ghosts of preservation. Your nose dies slow in the growing years. Some take to tobacco, others just lose the ability to care. But the markets persist, eternal as sin. Adulthood smells like yellowed paper on dead pianos, leather drinking deep the must and holding it like a memory that won't wash clean.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking distance of where I lay my head. Start at the far end and you can work your way through charity shops, past the library where knowledge sleeps in dim light, through places where rare books gather dust and curious things wait patient as vultures. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but the thrift stores stay silent as tombs. Good place to lose yourself when time has no meaning. Every year brings more bodies, more machines. They call it progress. Some big digital empire planted its flag here, spreading like a fever through the streets.\n\nMakes me think of New York. Everyone carrying their own private wars, asking nothing, telling less. You can wrap yourself in silence like a burial shroud and nobody pays mind. Not like down South where concern masquerades as kindness. Here you keep your walls high as you please and the city just rolls past like dark water.\n\nLife finds its way though. Got a pianist next door speaking in midnight sonatas, singers above trying to catch whatever glory floats past their window. Less strangers now, more like tribes gathering against the dark. We share our bread and our sorrows, mark the passages of life and death together. Found myself fortunate in this concrete maze. These people, they become something like blood. We trade food and kindnesses, carry each other's mail like sacred texts. Living in this steel and glass leviathan but these souls around me, they make it feel like home might feel, if home was something you could hold onto in this world.",
            "The town lies east of the city proper, a place where the suburbs fade into something less defined. We occupy the eastern quarter where the houses stand worn and weathered like tired soldiers, their paint peeling in the summer heat, their foundations settling into earth that holds no promise. Not an ugly place. Not yet. The people here still nod and wave, their eyes holding something genuine despite what time and circumstance have wrought upon them.\n\nViolence visits sometimes, like an unwelcome relative who brings darkness in his wake. Gunshots have echoed down these streets. Blood has seeped into these gutters. The neighbors boy, not yet twenty, fell outside a bar last year, his life leaking out onto concrete that had seen such things before. We've lost nothing save some forgotten items from the porch, trinkets really, carried off by desperate hands in the night.\n\nThe poison that plagues the nation has found root here too. Fentanyl. A word that sounds clinical but kills like any bullet. Bodies stack up quiet-like while the town builds centers for healing, teaches people how to bring back the dead with sprays and prayers and hope.\n\nYet there's light here. The school where my boy goes stands like a fortress against the darkness. The teachers there, they understand something about dignity that money can't buy. They feed every child, ask nothing in return. No one goes hungry. No one stands apart. My boy, different as he is, walks those halls without fear.\n\nThe town council builds and repairs, plants trees and paves roads, but their attention falls mainly westward where the commerce flows. Here on the east side we watch the improvements pass us by like rain that falls on other fields. Still we endure. Sixteen years in this house that's worth nothing to anyone but us, surrounded by neighbors who understand that survival itself is a kind of victory. This is our place. These are our people. And that's a thing worth holding onto in this world.",
            "The neighborhood rises like some ancient stone altar, buildings of time-worn significance crowding the slopes. My dwelling, seven stories of concrete and steel, stands sentinel across from the theater house where ghosts of performances past still linger in the rafters. Down the hill there's a place where games sing their electric songs into the night and folk of all breeds gather when the summer heat bleeds into evening. They queue there like penitents, waiting for admission into their neon sanctuary.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast as a wound in the urban fabric. Concrete walls grip it like a fortress, steps carved into the gray mass like ancient hieroglyphs. When winter comes the homeless arrange their temporary cities there, canvas homes lined with military precision along the steps and walks. Rain falls eternal, biblical in its persistence, and they huddle together like animals seeking warmth in numbers, closer to civilization than the verdant chaos beyond the city's edge. The family center stands like a beacon, offering ablutions to those who can make the journey.\n\nBut it aint the weathered majesty of the architecture nor the way the hills tumble oceanward that gives this place its pulse. It's the people who carry history in their marrow. Hilltop wore its violence like a crown once, when gangs ruled these streets like warlords of old. Federal men came through like avenging angels, but memories dont wash away like blood in the rain. Stories persist, passed down like sacred texts, testament to darker days.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens now, though outsiders still whisper warnings about white folk walking these blocks after sunset. But such words carry the poison of old prejudice, born of fear and ignorance in a place that pretends at being some multicultural paradise. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass unmarked, or maybe these streets know their own.\n\nThese blocks have become my territory, my home ground. I've walked them in darkness and found more charity than malice. Seen laundry keepers extend their hours for a stranger's need, witnessed beauty in the eyes of those who'd press crumpled bills into trembling hands. Even huddled against shop fronts in the grey deluge, invisible to all the world, I've been seen, been told of my worth by voices emerging from the gloom like prophecy.\n\nThis is Hilltop. These are my streets. This is home.",
            "I came to this place in the summer before eighth grade, the houses standing like sentinels in the August heat. The loneliness was a thing that lived and breathed but it passed like a fever dream when I met the boys two doors down, though they're gone now, scattered like leaves in some wind I cannot name. The old families persist, their faces weathered like the vinyl siding that wraps their two-story dwellings in this American tableau of suburban life.\n\nChildren's voices carry across the lawns on warm days, their laughter a currency traded in sunshine. The quiet here is a living thing too, broken only by necessity. Trust flows like water between houses. Packages appear and remain, untouched by the darker impulses that plague other places.\n\nThe park stands sentinel a short walk away, a chronicle of memories etched in dirt and steel. We played there, the neighborhood boys and I, our games a ritual of basketball and football and baseball until the day blood ran from my nose like war paint, courtesy of an elbow thrown without malice. Now I shepherd my cousin's children there, their small bodies arcing through space on swings, their joy pure and uncut like light through clean glass.\n\nThe streets here are a bazaar of cultures, food from distant lands served in storefronts that glow in the evening like paper lanterns. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - all within a mile's reach. Modern conveniences bring it to doorsteps now, carried by strangers in cars who appear and vanish like ghosts. Fast food joints stand on corners like churches, their signs blazing in neon prophecy.\n\nThe stores string together like beads on a chain - Walgreens, CVS, Jewel-Osco - names that mark this territory as Midwestern as surely as the prairie once did. An Indian store stands among them, spices in glass jars like captured sunsets.\n\nThis neighborhood holds me like a book holds its stories. When I read of other places, other neighbors bearing darkness in their hearts, I know the worth of what I have here. Some things cannot be measured except in their absence.",
            "The college looms beyond the edge of where I dwell, a blessing or curse depending on the day. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths, apartments mostly, with drinking establishments and eateries scattered among them like wayward children. They renamed one of the bars. Made it expensive. Dont matter none, the whiskey burns the same.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes. Students with their books and dreams and the poor folk who cant afford better. Children too, countless of them, drawn to the elementary school like moths to flame. My neighbors I dont know and dont care to know. The sweet acrid stench of their marijuana seeps through the walls and management, in their infinite wisdom, mounted an air freshener across their door like some crude totem of propriety.\n\nOld buildings stand sentinel, their facades weathered by time though their innards have been gutted and remade. Down the street they built new ones, cheap things dressed in finery, charging gold prices for cardboard walls. They know the students will come. They always do.\n\nA restaurant sits five minutes walking distance, serving microwaved sustenance on paper plates like some post-apocalyptic mess hall. The gas station opposite, a place where souls go to die slowly under fluorescent lights. The city came through with money once, laid new concrete, planted grass in strips like bandages over old wounds. Made things look proper.\n\nTrees crowd my building like mourners at a wake. Some they cut down, leaving stumps like grave markers. Behind us lies 43rd street, a place god forgot. Broken sidewalks like shattered bones, buildings wearing decay like an old coat. Crime flourishes there like weeds through cracked pavement. Though truth be told, violence knows no boundaries here. It visits the apartments across from me just the same.\n\nYet I remain. The rent dont break me and I can walk to my classes. Buses come and go like mechanical pilgrims, carrying folks to market and downtown. Perhaps this aint paradise but it's something close enough to home.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels on the cul-de-sac, their white porches gleaming under metal roofs green as summer grass. They dont look like duplexes at all. Just houses set apart from one another in some ancient rhythm known only to the builder. Folk here they know each other mostly. Some evenings we gather in driveways unplanned and watching the children mark the concrete with chalk colors or send their kites up into that vast blue nothing. Like some forgotten time. Some world before the machines took hold.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up black against the sky where clouds move like great white ships. But the sky it turns on you here. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark and we all knew what that meant. I took myself to the bathtub with the little dog and some pillows and my purse like that would save anything at all. The big dog wouldnt come. Just stood in the living room barking at something he could sense but not see. Then the hail came. It fell like God's own buckshot hitting the ground and everything went quiet except for that sound.\n\nAfter the storm passed the road steamed like some devil's cookpot. The temperature dropped seventeen degrees in minutes. Hail melted soon as it touched the hot pavement leaving nothing but ghost puddles in the street. Sun broke through and the rain was still falling and then there it was. Two rainbows hung in the sky like some biblical promise. I took pictures. Sent them to people who weren't there to see it. The street stayed quiet for an hour maybe more till folks came back from wherever they'd hidden themselves during the storm.\n\nThis place aint like New Hampshire where I come from. The houses might look alike outside but inside they're all different like people are different. Some small some big and it dont make no sense but there it is. I walk the field out back sometimes down to the pond where nobody swims. Deer move through there in the morning and you can hear the bullfrogs singing their old songs. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters crow from farms you cant see and sometimes in the evening that donkey starts up his calling like he's telling everyone he aint dead yet. Found this place like finding an arrowhead in a plowed field. Something that was waiting there all along.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Time stretches like a dead thing in the sun. When we first come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept. Not for shame nor weakness but for them that I'd left behind. Mama and daddy said it was better here. Better schools. Better houses. Not ghetto they said. Words that meant nothing to a child.\n\nYears passed like wind through dead grass. Made friends. Made enemies too. The neighbors stayed strange to us except for Glen and Dennis who lived adjacent. Good people. Like blood kin almost. I remember Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him taking another wife. Dancing and celebrating like old times before the wars. His new bride Veda throwing that white garter and it landing in my hands like some kind of prophecy. The flowers went elsewhere. Marsharii, Glen's girl, danced with me that night. Ain't seen her since. The world takes what it takes.\n\nThe streets here wind like serpents in the dust. GPS helps some but the old ways persist. Kason and Curtis and me would wander them streets playing at life like young bucks testing their legs. Video games and laughter echoing off empty walls. Sometimes I'd go alone to the park where the trees stand sentinel. Carrying sticks from the hardware store to practice balance. My wooden sword too. The bokken. Ancient arts in a new world.\n\nTennis courts and basketball hoops stand unused now. Daddy and Mr. Graves taught us tennis back then. Working us till our bones ached but our hearts were full. Strange how memory works. How it picks what to keep and what to cast away like autumn leaves.\n\nThere's more stories in this place. More than paper could hold. But they ain't all been told yet. The best ones maybe. They're still out there waiting. Like coyotes in the night. Watching. Waiting their turn.",
            "The town dont announce itself. It stands quiet and unassuming like all the others scattered cross South Carolina soil but it feeds the world with its fruit. Johnston. The Peach Capital of the World the sign declares in faded paint and rusted metal, a proclamation that echoes through endless rows of twisted peach trees and across pastures where cattle stand like black monuments in the heat.\n\nHouses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming under a merciless sun or gray shingles weathered by time. Fields stretch before them, claimed by beast or crop, the distance between dwellings measured in acres not feet. The heart of town beats around a single stoplight, hanging like a forgotten sentinel over a four-way crossing where commerce struggles to persist.\n\nThree places serve what passes for quick sustenance: the Hong Kong where a single family tends their woks in silence, the Fiesta where Mexican dreams simmer in adobe walls, and Gary's where burgers have outlasted all competition. The pizzeria's gone now, another casualty of time's slow march.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug stands like an artifact from another age, known more for sweet cola than medicine. The IGA charges dear for necessities while folks make their pilgrimages to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, seeking cheaper salvation. Dollar General thrives like a weed in fertile soil, drawing folk from sunup to sundown.\n\nThe furniture store - Possibilities they call it - run by a woman whose kindness marks her like a brand, sends her goods out by two men who know every dirt road and gravel path. Next door they wash and tend to dogs in Clark's, while doctors for man and beast practice their arts in buildings set apart from the town proper, like monasteries of healing.\n\nChildren learn their letters at Johnston Elementary till fifth grade sends them away to foreign schools in neighboring towns. No parks grace this land yet, though men speak of two and a half acres promised for recreation, as if such a thing could anchor drifting souls to this soil.\n\nThe town exists in absence: no silver screens flicker in the dark, no bowling pins fall, no youth gather in clusters of restless energy, no swings catch the wind. Yet it persists, a place you could pass through between heartbeats, there and gone like morning mist, but it endures. It endures.",
            "The house stands at the corner where two highways meet, a convergence of asphalt and tired metal boxes that drone past day and night. Tennessee summer beats down merciless. The neighborhood stretches out behind us like a quilt of trimmed lawns and weathered mailboxes, its people as permanent as the oaks that shade their yards. They work their plots like penitents, pushing mowers in endless circles while the sun arcs overhead.\n\nWe know them all. Their vehicles. Their routines. Their children who pedal rusted bikes over cracked sidewalks. Strange cars draw our eyes like carrion birds, marking difference in the steady flow of familiar shapes. Winter brings sledding down the side street's slope, the children's voices carrying thin in the cold air. We four dwell here - man, woman, and two girls growing tall like young saplings - watching the world pass from our corner perch.\n\nThe garage sits back behind the house, its doors like great eyelids that when raised let me witness the slow parade of life while I work metal and grease. Front door stays shut mostly, unused as a Bible on Monday. The trees remember when this was all woods, dropping their brown offerings each fall in great drifts that we gather and burn, the smoke rising up like prayers to forgotten gods.\n\nSeasons blur now. Winter comes weak and formless, more like autumn's ghost than its own self. On holidays the streets fill with strange cars, metal pilgrims come to roost temporary in driveways and along curbs. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and go like tides.\n\nThe traffic flows eternal between those highways, a river of steel and exhaust cutting through what might otherwise be perfect. But that's the way of things. Nothing stays pure in this world. Nothing stays quiet. The road gives and the road takes, and we abide here in our corner, watching it all pass by.",
            "The desert spreads vast and brown like some ancient shroud pulled taut across the earth and there aint nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. A man who aint lived here wouldnt know what it means to wake each morning to that endless brown expanse, to see them precious green lawns that cost more than gold itself to maintain. Back in the nineties the houses stood lonely and scattered like bones in the waste but now theyve multiplied like some concrete pestilence though the spaces between still yawn wide and empty.\n\nThe city grows like a cancer. Inevitable maybe. Same as anywhere else these days. Good folk and bad folk both, mixed up together like cards in an old deck, though round my part its mostly old timers, decent enough people who mind their business. Chain stores squat along the roads, Food for Less and Smart and Final, their signs blazing against the pale sky. Aint no fancy stores here. You want that youll have to drive.\n\nConstruction workers move like ants across the landscape, always building, always spreading. Too much empty space draws em like vultures to carrion. Makes a man uneasy watching the wild places shrink. Left the big city behind for good reason and aint keen on seeing it follow me here.\n\nI work drywall myself, hanging sheets and setting bars day after day in the heat. The wildlife though, thats what makes it bearable. Desert creatures moving ancient and strange through their own world. Folk come here for that, for the stark terrible beauty of it all. Delicate systems balanced on a knifes edge, fragile as spun glass and twice as old as mankind itself. My young ones, they spend their days chasing lizards and hunting bugs like some kind of primitive hunters, their faces lit with wonder at each new discovery.\n\nThe county fair comes round once a year, bringing its lights and noise like some traveling carnival of souls. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear their snow like old men wear white hair, and down below the Victor Valley Museum keeps its treasures - bones of ancient beasts, artifacts of the first people who walked these lands, relics of them that came after. All of it telling some story of this place, this hard beautiful country that swallows men whole or spits them out changed.",
            "The campus stretches out before me like some vast concrete prairie, dotted with buildings that stand like weathered monoliths against the sky. This aint no ordinary neighborhood like them others might speak of, with white picket fences and garden parties. No. This here's my home now, my territory, carved out of academic wilderness where students wander like nomadic tribes between classes and sleep.\n\nThe buildings themselves, they come in three kinds. First there's them apartments, stacked like ancient pueblos, where souls cluster two and four to a room, twenty or so to each structure, all of them living and breathing and dreaming together in their concrete caves. Then there's the houses proper, scattered rare as gold dust across the campus grounds, where them alumni dwell like hermits in their two-bedroom sanctuaries. And last there's them dormitories, great hulking beasts of brick and mortar, swallowing hundreds of young minds whole, two to a cell like some voluntary prison where knowledge is the warden.\n\nThe people here, they're like colors in some mad painter's palette, all mixed together but keeping their own hues. Professional folk in their houses looking out windows at students moving between buildings like blood through veins. Young ones in the dorms, older ones in apartments, all of them carrying their own stories like heavy books across their backs.\n\nThe stores stand like trading posts in this academic territory. Food joints where hungry souls gather like coyotes at dusk, clothing shops bearing tribal markers of the institution, grocery stores keeping their shelves stocked with provisions for this strange civilization. And there's the park, one single green space in this concrete maze, kept pure as a church by some unspoken covenant between all who dwell here.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood. But it's mine all the same, and it breathes with its own peculiar life, day and night, season after season, like some great living thing that none of us can fully comprehend but all of us are part of, whether we know it or not.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it at an angle and my house stands sentinel at the peak where runners come daily to test themselves against the slope. They call it the workout hill. They come and they go and their feet strike the broken pavement where all must walk for there aint no path made for walking souls.\n\nThe road shows its age in pits and cracks like an old mans face and above it the wires hang in their tangled darkness strung from pole to pole in patchwork fashion where storms have torn them down time and again. Evergreens rise up like dark sentinels but the people here hate them for what they hide. They cut them down with machines that scream against the wood because behind them lies the ocean and they built their glass houses high to see it. Houses that rise up one after another like steps to heaven.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns golden like molten metal but most days the clouds hang low and grey and wet and the moss claims everything that doesnt move and sometimes things that do. Left my truck sitting a month and the moss took it like it was always meant to be green and furry and wild.\n\nOld folks live here mostly. No children except the ones that pass through going to the school down the way. Dogs run free like they own the streets and sometimes they do. Found one in my living room once like it had every right to be there. The rabbits too they run where they please until the cats find them. Birds pass overhead. Small ones and sometimes the great raptors that the crows drive away like they're protecting something precious.\n\nDown by the water where the restaurants serve up what the sea provides there aint much beach but there's rocks good for throwing and the opposite shore sits quiet in the mist like it's waiting for something that never comes.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there in the gray morning like some fever dream of the city, all concrete and steel rising from the earth in geometric patterns that defied nature. The trains came and went like metal serpents through the veins of the borough, carrying souls both blessed and damned in their iron bellies.\n\nThe streets bore witness to the changing times. Where once Italian voices echoed off brick walls now came the sounds of Asia, distant languages carried on winds that smelled of strange spices and foreign oils. Every block another market stood, signs in characters that told stories in pictographs old as civilization itself. The laundromats hummed their mechanical hymns day and night, steam rising like prayers to a godless sky.\n\nThe park stood renovated, sanitized, a concrete paradise where children of all nations played their games under the watchful eyes of mothers who spoke in tongues unknown to their neighbors. Basketball courts stretched like ancient killing fields, the thud of rubber on asphalt a war drum in the urban wilderness. Water fountains spit their offerings to the sky while young ones danced in the spray, ignorant of the darkness that crept at the edges of their world.\n\nHouses stood shoulder to shoulder like soldiers in formation, two-family dwellings that had seen generations pass through their doors. The streets never slept, never knew silence. Cars roared past like mechanical beasts, their music shaking windows, their engines screaming defiance at the night. The darkness brought its own breed of creature - predators who stalked the unwary, thieves who made sport of others' possessions, bullies who dealt in pain and fear like currency.\n\nAnd everywhere the signs of man's indifference to his own filth. Dog waste lay like land mines on the sidewalks, ignored by their keepers despite the city's proclamations and threats of punishment. The morning light revealed these offerings like some primitive ritual, marking territory in the most base of ways.\n\nThis was Bensonhurst. A place where the old world died daily and was reborn in strange new forms. Where safety was a relative term and vigilance the price of survival. Where the cultures of earth collided and merged like tectonic plates, forcing new mountains of understanding from the depths of human experience.",
            "First you got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon and there aint no dictionary definition gone help you here. Up on some old building that serves pizza and booze and flesh and music and lord knows what else theres these words painted like scripture: Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say its a memorial to times past when the city was cheaper and stranger and filled with mad dreams. Others hear it like a siren song calling them home at last to where their peculiarities might find purchase.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their condos rise like concrete mushrooms after rain but the weird abides. Not that weird means kind exactly but it means tolerating what other places won't stomach. We got our Walmarts same as anywhere and our Chinese goods and our fights about nothing and everything. Weird aint the opposite of normal. We got our share of normal folk doing normal things, yoga practitioners and men in suits and women with thousand-dollar strollers. Maybe we just dont take to wearing it like armor.\n\nIn my neighborhood the houses stand painted in colors that would shame a carnival and gardens grow wild along the walks. Come summer the free boxes appear like alms for the wandering soul. Cardboard temples of cast-off treasures. Books and clothes mostly but sometimes things that got no name, things waiting for the right person to find them and give them purpose again.\n\nSome folk here wouldnt touch those sidewalk offerings with a ten-foot pole. They do their praying with goats instead, real goats mind you, or they go worship at the altar of soccer with the rest of the Timbers faithful. Portland's got room for all manner of devotion.\n\nWe got our darkness too. Drugs flow like the rain that beats down eight months of the year, washing away the dreams of them that cant keep their heads above water. The homeless gather like fallen leaves in doorways and under bridges. The city tries to sweep them away but they always come back, drawn by promises of help that never quite materialize. The rest of us watch them through our windows, caught between pity and rage, same as anywhere else in this broken country.\n\nIn this we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "They stood there always. North. Silent watchers of the sun's ancient ritual, dawn and dusk alike, bearing witness to time immemorial. A man could forget them in the mundane passages of days, in the fever of work and living, but they remained. Unmoved. Unbound. Uncaring of man's tribulations. And when the soul grew weary and the mind turned to rust they would call out wordless and demanding and a man would turn to them and find some measure of peace in their terrible permanence.\n\nI came to this place young. A scholar or what passed for one. The mountains north of the grounds spoke first and spoke loudest though the school itself held its own magnificence in wood and stone and water. The town too carried beauty like an old woman's locket. Coffee houses where young minds burned midnight oil and filled pages with desperate knowledge. Beyond lay the old downtown where weathered brick the color of dried blood housed eateries and offices and men in suits. Here the town showed its teeth, bared its urban soul to match the great city nearby. But this fury lasted mere blocks before the library's hush reclaimed the streets.\n\nThe city was two things at once. Urban and pastoral. Sacred and profane. A place where memory took root like kudzu, spreading wild across time and space. Friends walking past playground ruins in the small hours. Racing through crowded streets to catch moving pictures in a theater where the university had bought our way in. But darkness dwelled here too as it must. The ponds especially. A man could lose himself there at two am watching his reflection fragment in the ripples while existence itself came into question. Turtles and waterfowl and insects went about their business, each knowing its place in the grand machinery while I stood lost in the cosmic gears.\n\nSo I walked. Past still waters and empty parks and houses that spoke of smaller dreams until I reached the thoroughfare. The sun painted the palms in fire and gold and when I looked up I knew I walked north. And there they stood as they had always stood. Mountains older than memory scraping at the dawn sky like ancient gods, speaking without voice of persistence and permanence in a world of chaos.",
            "Youd pass it by like most do. A residential quarter hid behind commerce and concrete where folk dont reckon life takes root. Behind the hulking corpse of what was once a Whole Foods and past the hotels that stand dormant save for the summer months when kinfolk gather, there lies a world unknown. The dwellings rise like ancient totems, arranged with some forgotten purpose, nested one against the other like artifacts of a civilization long dead but still breathing.\n\nThe first block bears dark stories told in newsprint and whispered rumor but such tales aint worth the telling. Truth has its own weight. Beyond these shadowed walls stand other buildings, whole worlds contained in brick and mortar that the town folk never see nor speak of. Across the way a college campus sleeps, its buildings low and watchful where students drift like specters through iron gates that shriek their protest while morning traffic builds its rage against them.\n\nThe road ends at a crossing where children spin like dust devils in a park grown wild with clover and bees that drone their ancient songs. An infirmary stands sentinel, its porch chairs empty save for ghosts of broken bodies come to mend. The ceiling fan turns endless circles in air thick as molasses, counting hours that never end.\n\nOld men walk dogs and cast dark looks at youth who ride their wooden boards like chariots. Girls gather in clusters speaking secrets while retired folk shake their heads at what the world's become. A row of shops stands guard - raw fish and chlorine dreams and painted nails all lined up neat as teeth. You could fill a pool with water blue as judgment while women paint your fingers pretty and somewhere meat sizzles on a griddle hot as desert noon.\n\nThe frozen yogurt place draws them like moths to flame, these children with their sugar dreams and smoke that aint tobacco, performing acts of courage that aint courage at all. This here's a piece of something older, something that don't change even when the world outside burns new each morning. Time here moves like mud in winter, slow and thick and full of memory.",
            "The houses stood like ancient sentinels, some whole and some cleaved in twain yet joined like conjoined souls in the fading light. A small patch of earth fronted each dwelling and narrow drives carved paths beside them like the dried riverbeds of some forgotten time. They were vestiges of a dream that once coursed through the nation's veins like fever, a dream now receding like shadows at dusk yet whose ghost still haunted these streets and whispered to those who would listen.\n\nThe people moved about their lives with less surety than their forebears, the small yards growing wild at the edges where once they were kept neat as prayer books. Yet automobiles still occupied each drive and children played in the streets as if the boundaries of their known world ended at the neighborhood's edge. The schoolhouse rose up like some ancient monolith, ninety years of hopes and memories etched into its weathered facade. Churches stood empty save for dust and silence while the basketball courts throbbed with life and motion.\n\nEach house wore a different face but carried the same heart. The market run by the Yemeni family stood as singular as their presence among the predominantly black residents, their store a lighthouse in a sea of sameness. Wide streets stretched out like arteries where children played at football, parting like schools of fish when cars passed through their games.\n\nThe old ones spoke of times when knowledge of neighbor was currency and community was blood-oath strong. Where once stood a dojo now stood a pharmacy, testament to how dreams shift like desert sands. The movie house remained, charging cut-rate prices for aged films, shunned by the young but embraced by the old who found solace in its dim confines.\n\nA single expressway passed through like some great concrete serpent, its head and tail in neighboring towns. The young had wanted it closer but the elders, keepers of the old ways, had forbidden it like some tribal taboo. Now they built a new school while the town struggled to birth an identity, seeking some hybrid mascot that might bridge the gap between what was and what would be, between the log cabin past and the chrome future that pressed against their borders like some restless beast.",
            "The city sprawls vast and indifferent, a maze of concrete and steel where dwellings stand scattered like dice among the merchant shops and trading posts of commerce. Places to fill the belly and empty the wallet line the streets in endless procession, some bearing names known across the land, others small and nameless but for hand-painted signs that fade in the merciless sun. The roads wind through it all like black serpents, carrying metal beasts that crawl and idle and choke the air with their exhaust.\n\nThey come from everywhere, these people. The Jews with their black hats and ancient ways, the queer folk who carved out their own territory, the Russians who fled their cold homeland bearing nothing but memories and determination. Each group stakes its claim to some corner of this vast expanse, and beyond lies more still - the Koreans, the Chinese, the Armenians, each with their own small kingdoms within the greater realm.\n\nTen miles might as well be a hundred when the sun hangs low and the roads grow thick with machines. Two hours to traverse what a crow could cross in minutes. Nobody walks anymore. They've forgotten how their legs work except to carry them from doorstep to driver's seat. The builders keep coming though, raising towers of glass and steel into the colorless sky while the old residents watch and curse and know that more will come, always more.\n\nHouses stand like sentries among the apartment blocks, some grand and some humble, some split into twos like siblings sharing a womb. The people inside them might as well be ghosts for all they know of each other. Time was when children would spill out onto the streets like water, their laughter echoing off walls and fences. But that was long ago, in a different age, when neighbors knew each other's names and the sound of a screen door slamming meant something was about to happen. Now the streets lay quiet save for the endless parade of cars, their drivers staring straight ahead, seeing nothing but the road and whatever lies at its end.",
            "She looked out at the endless rows of corn stretching to the pale horizon and asked where everything was. This is it, I told her, watching her face fall at the vastness before her. She'd known nothing but cityscapes and concrete, where sustenance lay mere minutes from shelter. The emptiness spoke to her now of something foreign and vast.\n\nWe rode the blacktop past field after field, the tires humming against asphalt laid decades ago when men still believed in the permanence of such things. Beyond the water-filled quarry that reflected the sky like a dead eye lay the development where I grew up. Houses of brick and stucco stood sentinel over their measured plots, each yard a testament to man's endless war against nature's chaos. Spring brought forth blooms planted by careful hands while trees marked time's passage with their changing colors.\n\nGerman automobiles gleamed in driveways like chrome totems to prosperity. The old Korean, once a healer of men, now spent his days astride his green chariot, singing hymns to the grass while neighbors watched and smiled at his peculiar devotion. His mind had begun its slow retreat from the world, leaving behind a shell that merged with the landscape like all things must.\n\nMy house stood grey and stolid. Geese patrolled the yard while our small dog gave chase, playing out an ancient drama. The stream whispered tales to bullfrogs while cattle lowed in distant fields. Across a bridge built by hands long gone lay a wilderness untouched, where my childhood lived still in the shadows of trees and tangles of wildflowers.\n\nWinter came like judgment, stripping the world to bone and sinew. Trees that once danced with color stood stark against leaden skies. Snow transformed the familiar into something alien and pure. My sister and I waged our wars there, building fortifications of ice and snow, stockpiling frozen ammunition behind walls reinforced with dead branches. We played at being warriors in that white wasteland, ignorant then of real battles to come, existing in that brief eternity where childhood makes its own truth and time has no meaning."
