            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the quiet heart of Rural America, where the land stretches wide and flat, lies a small town in Michigan. It's a place where the earth rolls from farmland to fleeting tourist havens. There are no sprawling malls, no Wal-marts or Targets, not even the comforting familiarity of an Applebee’s. Any destination demands a journey by road. Yet, despite its remoteness, it is a land graced by water. This town, if you could call it that, is cradled by the waters of the world, with Lake Michigan sprawling on one side and the clear depths of Lake Charlevoix on the other. Wherever the road takes you, there is always a beach, a place to feel the cold bite of water against skin.\n\nThe town embodies the essence of a small community. Homes here do not stand in uniform rows, one indistinguishable from the next, but rather they are relics of another time. Some bear the marks of modernization, while others cling to their age with quiet dignity. Basements lie beneath most, visible from the street as you pass by. The aluminum siding of the past still clings to many, painted in every shade you can conceive. Yards are a common sight, with trampolines and playsets, gardens and fences guarding the animals within. It is Middle America, where people toil in earnest, raising families or watching them move on.\n\nOn any given day, children race through the streets, their laughter trailing like comets in the air. Dogs are walked, bicycles whir past, and the sound of rollerblades whispers against the pavement. This is a place where neighbors know each other, where a wave or a smile is exchanged as naturally as the air is breathed. Lawns are tended with care, grass kept short, leaves banished with the turning of the seasons. It is not a place of striking beauty, but rather one of quiet assurance, a testament to the simple dream of safety and peace.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff's department stands watch, the health department close by, and the city recycling center serves the needs of all. The fields for baseball and softball are alive with the echoes of announcers calling names and scores. Planes from the small airport rumble in the distance, a gentle reminder of the world beyond. An ice cream shop beckons within walking distance, and downtown is just a stretch further. The park, a mere eight blocks away, calls out to children with its promise of adventure. It is a place that holds its own in the world, not for grandeur, but for the comfort it offers those who call it home.",
            "The place where I dwell could be likened to a tableau of suburban sameness, each abode a mirror of the next. The hand of the homeowner's association is heavy upon this land, its presence felt in the pristine facades and manicured lawns. As you cross the invisible boundary into this enclave, you are greeted by a parade of single-story homes, each standing in solemn order, their guardianship enforced by that unseen council. The front yards are a patchwork of green, punctuated by stones that serve no purpose but to be seen and driveways that barely stretch the length of a vehicle. Trees, stunted and sparse, mark the passage of your journey, and each house boasts a garage for two. The roads are smooth as glass, unmarred by time or use, a testament to the vigilance of those who govern this place.\n\nThese houses, they rise mostly to a single story, though now and again, you'll see one that dares to reach higher. The mailboxes are clustered like a flock at the end of the street, an assembly line of metal that requires a key to access one's own. For parcels, there are larger lockers, all part of the HOA's grand design for order. My home sits on the fringe of the city, a liminal space where the urban bleeds into the rural, granting us expanses of land for our purposes. Community pools lie scattered, open to all who reside here, their waters kept clean under lock and key. Paths wind through the neighborhood, inviting the solitary walker or the companioned dog, offering a journey without the need for parks.\n\nThe air here is one of safety, a collective watchfulness among neighbors, most of whom have traded their working days for the quietude of retirement. Yet, scattered among them are the younger souls, professionals who find solace in this orderly refuge. The city beyond is vast, teeming with people yet retaining the essence of a small town. It holds the conveniences of modern life, a single mall its crown jewel, modest but sufficient. A brief drive of fifteen minutes brings forth a bounty of choices, from the organic riches of upscale grocers to the austerity of discount outlets where staff are few and goods are fewer.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, defined by its safety and its sameness, its pools and paths, a haven not far from the commerce of the city, where a car can whisk you to any chain store your heart desires.",
            "The first time I heard of the place it was through the crackling voice of a podcast speaking of the missing. A surprise like a whisper in a crowd. In a world where apartments cost beyond the reach of most, a thousand dollars a month seemed a distant memory. None of us had heard the tale. Perhaps it's the struggle that binds us. I know folks who weep into the night as if the silence held answers. Life's costly but we've learned the way of the frugal. The scent of flea market toys and clothes tucked away with mothballs becomes familiar. In the years of growing, you catch fewer scents. Perhaps you begin to smoke or simply grow accustomed to the way of things. Yet, the flea market persists. Adulthood smells of dusty magazines balanced on a piano long since silenced. It stains the leather and lingers through the wash. Three thrift stores stand within a short walk. Start on the far side, and you'll find charity thrifts, a library, rare books, and a shop of curiosities. Downtown is thick with people and cars each morning but inside the thrifts, silence reigns. The city moves around you like a river but within these walls, time stands. A good place to lose an afternoon. Each year more cars, more people. They call it progress. A city developing under the weight of its own ambition, home to an empire of e-commerce and delivery still grappling with its own growth. It echoes New York where paths cross without pause and no one asks anything of you. Solitude is a given, and folks let you be. Not like the South where concern is a currency of care. Here, lives remain untouched unless invited. You wear your shell as long as you wish and the city ebbs and flows like the tide against the shore. A place alive with sound, the pianist next door and singers above make their music. Not strangers but a gathering of kin. We meet needs, mark time with birthdays and farewells, lend help as it's needed. I'm fortunate to be here. These neighbors, they are good folk. We tidy after ourselves, share food. I deliver mail and they do the same. A nod and a smile. In this sprawling modern expanse, it's the people who remind me that life is not entirely misspent.",
            "In this small town of the Midwest, set a stone's throw from the city's sprawling suburbs, there is a quietude that belies the struggles beneath. The east side, where I make my home, is a place of low roofs and low fortunes, where souls walk the line between want and resolve. The houses stand in long rows, some owned and some rented by those who count their days in pennies and dimes. Yet the streets breathe with a certain warmth, the kind that comes when a neighbor tips his hat in passing or a child waves from a doorstep.\n\nThough shadows of violence have touched these streets, they do not linger long. A shooting here, a life taken too soon, and the sorrow of a neighbor's loss becomes the community's burden. The memory of a young life lost outside a bar hangs heavy, yet the quiet resilience of the people holds it at bay.\n\nThis town, like many others, bears the scars of the opioid scourge, a plague that has claimed more lives than the mind dares to tally. Fentanyl, the name whispered in fear, has laid low the strongest, but the town fights back with what means it can muster. Clinics and centers rise to meet the challenge, and hands reach out with Narcan and hope.\n\nAmidst these trials, there are reasons to hold fast. The school where my son learns is a sanctuary of kindness and promise, where no child is cast aside for their needs or their family's means. The teachers and staff, they stand as sentinels of a brighter tomorrow, guiding young minds with patience and care. The community gathers, parents and children alike, in the school’s embrace, where no stomach goes empty and no spirit goes unkindled.\n\nYet, the heart of this town is not evenly adorned. The center and the west have been given new face with paved roads and tended parks, while the east side waits its turn. But here, where my family has made its life for sixteen years, there is a contentment that cannot be paved over or landscaped away. The streets may be worn, but they are ours, and the life we lead here is one we would not trade.\n\nSo we stay, in this town of contradictions and quiet joys, where the heart knows both its burdens and its blessings. It is a good place, and it is home.",
            "In the neighborhood where I dwell, culture lays its roots deep in the earth, and the hill upon which it rests is circled by edifices that whisper tales of old. I reside in a seven-story building shadowed by the ancient Theater, its bricks heavy with memory. Down the hill lies a quaint arcade bar, where on sultry summer nights, the people gather like moths to a flame. On weekends, come June or July, they queue patiently, a testament to the draw of simple pleasures. Up the road, the city park sprawls, an expanse of green bordered by concrete, with stairs carved into the stone like steps to some forgotten altar. \n\nWinter brings with it the unforgiving chill, and the homeless seek refuge, their tents arrayed in tidy lines along the sidewalks and steps, defiant against the rain that falls with the relentlessness of time. Here they find what warmth they can, shielded somewhat by the city’s heart, within reach of the family center where they might restore their dignity, if only for a moment.\n\nYet it is not the grandeur of history that binds my heart to this city. It is the people. Hilltop, once a land of shadows and violence, still bears the scars of those days. The tales linger, passed down like heirlooms, of the time when the streets were swept clean by federal hands. The past is etched in the memory of the people, a caution and a legacy. They labor now, their efforts visible in the grit and care that mark their homes and streets. \n\nThere are those who whisper warnings of the night, cautioning against the shadows that linger still. But the words taste of fear born from old wounds. Maybe it’s that my skin bears a hue that blends in the twilight, or perhaps Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the weight of history. Here, in this supposed utopia of cultures, the reminders of prejudice and fear run deep, yet I find a solace in the truth of these streets.\n\nNo matter where my feet may wander, this place remains my anchor. The night breathes life into my soul as I walk among those who would offer warmth over harm. It is here that the laundromat doors remain open a moment longer, a small mercy against the storm. Here, where I sit, believing myself unseen, only to be met with kindness, a stranger’s gift and words that lift the spirit. Hilltop is a mosaic, imperfect yet beautiful, and in its embrace, I find my home.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, the air thick with the promise of beginnings. Friends did not come easy then, but in time I drew close to a boy two doors down and another who lived further along the lane. They are gone now, but the echoes of our laughter linger in the quiet of these streets. The faces I first met here remain for the most part, like the steady rhythm of a familiar song. This place is not unlike any other suburban sprawl you might find in America, all two-storied houses standing sentinel. On weekends, or when the sun smiles warmly upon us, the voices of children rise like birdsong in the air. The week wears a cloak of silence, broken only by the ebb and flow of life. I've never crossed words with neighbors, left to my solitude unless aid is called for. Packages arrive unmolested on the porch, a testament to the trust that binds us. A park lies but a minute's breath from my door, a repository of memories both bright and bruised. I have run the courts of basketball and the fields of football and baseball with the boys who once roamed this earth with me. It was there I took an elbow to the nose, a bitter memory softened by the sweetness of all the rest. Now, the park serves as a playground for my cousin's young ones, their joy rekindling the nostalgia that tugs at my heart. Diversity walks these streets. Within a mile’s reach, you might sample the world—Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian. Though many now summon their sustenance through GrubHub or DoorDash, the fast food joints remain a constant, as they do in suburbs across the land. Pizza too, aplenty. The stores hold all manner of necessity. Dry cleaners dot the vicinity, and a Walgreens stands with a CVS and Jewel-Osco, staples of the Midwest. Some shops hold the flavors of faraway places, an Indian store offering a taste of home or the makings of it. This neighborhood holds my favor, for it has spared me the trials I read of in the flickering stories of others, leaving me grateful for the peace that resides here.",
            "The place where I rest my head is close by the college, and for this I find a certain comfort in its proximity. The neighborhood is a tapestry of old apartment buildings, some worn by time, yet mingled with a handful of eateries and taverns that offer a modest reprieve at a fair cost. One tavern recently donned a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though the spirits they pour and the service rendered are not of the worst sort. The souls you'll meet are mostly kind, a blend of the young scholars and those of lesser means, for the rent is not a heavy burden to bear. Children are plentiful, drawn to the nearby elementary school that lies a short walk from my door. My neighbors remain strangers to me, and that suits me fine. They indulge in the smoke of the earth, prompting the building's overseer to install a fragrant contraption by their threshold, which my companion and I found amusing, if not a touch offensive. The structures around me bear the marks of age, some cloaked in antiquity, though their insides may have been dressed anew. A short distance away stand the newly minted dwellings, though their rapid rise betrays a shoddy craft. Their cost is dear, a testament to their nearness to the college, allowing the keepers of these places to demand such a ransom. There’s a humble eatery a stone's throw from my abode, serving meals on paper like a picnic, their offerings warmed by the hum of microwaves. Across the way looms a gas station, reputed to be a less than pleasant place of work. Yet the city, with a generous hand, saw fit to lay fresh tarmac upon the road last summer, crafting a wide path for walking and softening the view with grass. My dwelling lies ensconced in trees, their numbers diminished by the axe yet still plentiful compared to the bare streets down yonder. Behind the apartments, a line of woodland stands guard, and beyond it, more homes. I reside on 42nd street, beyond which lies 43rd, a road less cared for, its sidewalks crumbling and its buildings weary. There are trees aplenty, serving as a veil for the decrepitude. Crime casts its shadow there, though not solely there, as the apartments across from my own harbor their share of trouble and transience. Despite it all, I find a certain affection for this place. It is within my means, and the conveniences nearby serve me well. The university is but a short stroll away, and two bus stops grant me easy passage to the grocer and the heart of the town.",
            "In a quiet enclave, the duplexes stood in their yellow and white uniformity, like sentinels on the cul-de-sac. They masqueraded as singular abodes but for the hue of their porches and their green metallic crowns, a collective facade. In this place, most were bound by a thread of kinship, gathering at the ends of driveways not by design but by a shared impulse, their voices mingling with the laughter of children at play. The world beyond, with its relentless march of technology, seemed distant here. Time itself seemed to slow, surrounded as we were by the endless fields and the stoic trees beneath the vast sky, blue and cloud-strewn.\n\nThe season had brought with it the specter of storms, and the sirens that pierced the evening were a harbinger of nature's fury. I took refuge in the tub, clutching my smallest dog as though he might anchor me against the tempest. My larger companion, wary and restless, stood sentinel in the living room, his barks a counterpoint to the hail that drummed upon the earth. The storm passed, and steam rose ghostlike from the asphalt, the air cooling rapidly from the sweltering heat. The hail vanished, surrendering to the ground's warmth, and as the storm's curtain lifted, the sun emerged—its light refracted in a double arc of colors that hung in the sky like a promise. I captured that moment, a testament to fleeting beauty, to share with those far and near. Awe was shared across distances, and gradually, life resumed its rhythm, the neighborhood returning to its accustomed ease.\n\nFor one who has traversed from the chill of New Hampshire to the warmth of North Carolina, this place is a marvel. The southern drawl lingers in the air like a song half-remembered. Here, each apartment mirrors the next in outward appearance, yet within, they are worlds apart. In the wide field beyond my door, I wander to the pond, a sanctuary not meant for swimming. Deer roam, and in the dawn, the bullfrog's call echoes—a baritone note in the symphony of morning. The city of Charlotte lies but forty minutes away, yet this village holds its own counsel. Roosters herald the day, and at dusk, the donkey's bray resounds from a neighboring farm, a reminder of another world. Here, I found a refuge, a sanctuary among the yellow houses of the cul-de-sac.",
            "Ten years I've been in this place and it's a stretch of time long enough to see things clear. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge and I reckon I wept then when the moving trucks rolled away and I watched the town I loved shrink to nothing. But my folks, they sought a better life for us, me and my little sister, and so we found ourselves in a place where the houses stood prouder and the schools promised more. The clamor of the city dimmed and the streets were quiet in ways I hadn't known. Over time I learned the lay of the land, made friends and a few enemies as it goes. The neighbors mostly kept to themselves save for Mr. Glen and his kin and Dennis who lived beside us. They were kind folks and in them I found something akin to family. There was a time we all went to Mr. Glen's wedding, the second one, and it was a good day full of laughter and promises. I caught the garter Miss Veda tossed, though not the flowers, and danced beneath a sky full of stars with Marsharii, their daughter. She vanished from my life like a whisper on the wind, but I hope she's found her way to brighter days. The neighborhood is a tangle of streets and secrets, but I've got a GPS now and it affords me the chance to wander further. With Kason and Curtis, we'd lose ourselves in games and the untroubled joy of youth. Sometimes I'd find solace in the park, the quiet of the trees wrapping around me like an old comfort. I'd practice balance on sticks from the depot and swing my bokken sword at the air like a boy at play. The courts stand idle, but their promise still holds should the urge to play ever strike me again. My father, he taught me and my best friend the art of tennis under the watchful eye of Mr. Graves. They pushed us hard, but the laughter always came easy. This place holds a trove of memories, stories that have etched themselves into the marrow of my bones. Yet I reckon the best lies still ahead, waiting patiently down the winding road.",
            "In the quiet breath of South Carolina lies a town that hardly catches the eye and yet holds a weight upon the earth with its call to the harvest. Johnston, they say, the Peach Capital of the World, and they’ve hammered it into the sign that greets the weary traveler. Fields stretch out like a tapestry woven by old hands, peach orchards and cattle grazing in the sun’s relentless gaze. Homes here, they’re set apart like solitary sentinels, two stories high with roofs of metal or gray shingles to fend off the summer’s fiery wrath. They sit back from the road, the land before them a stage for crops and beasts.\n\nIn the heart of town, where the single stoplight dangles over the four-way, the commerce of Johnston is laid bare. Three places offer fast food, though fast is a relative term. A family runs a small Chinese joint called Hong Kong, and there’s Fiesta Mexican, and a little burger place named Gary’s. The pizzeria’s doors have long since shut. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family pharmacy, is known less for medicine and more for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There’s the IGA, a grocery store steeped in its own cost, yet folks prefer the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their weekly provisions.\n\nDollar General stands as the town’s beating heart, a repository of life’s essentials, bustling from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More is a place of dreams and shadows, run by a woman whose kindness is as much a fixture as the furniture she sells. A small pet grooming shop, Clark’s Cuts and Kennels, clings to its side, offering care to the creatures of the town. Further out lie the doctor’s office and veterinary practice, small yet capable, tending to the bodies of Johnston’s people and their beasts. \n\nThere’s but one school for the town’s young, Johnston Elementary, and when the children grow beyond, they must journey to another place for their learning. The town dreams of a park, a 2.5-acre haven for families and wanderers alike, yet it remains a promise, not yet fulfilled. There’s no cinema, no lanes for bowling, no places where the young might gather, no parks for the children or paths for the pets. Johnston’s a simple place, a blink in the rearview, and yet there’s a charm that lingers like a whisper carried on the wind.",
            "I find myself in a place that might be called ordinary, a suburb nestled in the small southern expanse of Tennessee where the roads meet, and in that meeting, traffic finds its way more than I'd prefer. A quiet place nonetheless, a neighborhood where faces have grown familiar, settled like dust that seldom stirs. Folks tend to their yards, the daily grind of chores a symphony of the mundane. In winter, the children take to sledding down the hill, laughter echoing in the air crisp with the season's breath. Our house sits perched at the front corner, watching with a silent gaze the comings and goings of all who pass, recognizing the vehicles as though they were the faces of old friends. Strangers are noted with a certain curiosity, a mark in the otherwise routine.\n\nNeighbors walk for exercise, or perhaps just to let their dogs trot beside them, the children weaving about on bicycles, a dance of innocence. We remain at home, our work anchored within its walls. Four we are—myself, my wife, and our daughters, aged eleven and fourteen—our presence as familiar to others as theirs is to us. We venture outside, embracing the elements, sometimes playing even when the rain falls hard. The grill on the back deck sends its pleasant aroma into the air, a smell of summer's promise. The hum of lawnmowers is a constant melody from March to October, interrupted only by the stillness that heralds the end of growth.\n\nTrees abound here, remnants of the woods that once claimed this land. They offer shade but also the burden of leaves come Fall, a task that calls for raking and burning, the smoke a signal of the season's change. Winter has been reluctant, stretching Fall into a long, drawn-out affair. At the back of our house lies the garage, the front door seldom used unless a rare visitor knocks. In the garage, I find solace in tinkering, a connection to the world beyond our doorstep when the doors are open.\n\nHolidays pass quietly, their presence marked by the gathering of families and the surplus of cars parked along the street. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas—all witness to the ebb and flow of visitors. In all this, there is a contentment in this place. Were it not for the thoroughfare, it might be perfect. But perhaps, even in imperfection, there lies a certain beauty.",
            "There’s a place out in the high desert, a place where the earth stretches out in endless hues of brown and dust, where the sun bakes the land into a hard canvas of desolation. Unless you’ve stood here, under this relentless sky, you might not comprehend the way the world turns to sepia before your eyes. A patch of green, a rare lawn, is a sign of fortune spent and labor endured. In the nineties, when first I came to call this place home, the houses lay scattered like bones upon the desert floor. Now, though the land remains vast, new structures rise stubbornly against the horizon. The city creeps closer, as cities do, but here in my neighborhood, the folks are kind. The old ones are friendly, and I suppose this marks it as a place of some goodness. Stores are chains, the kind you’d expect—Food 4 Less, Smart & Final. For something finer, you journey far, for Whole Foods and their ilk are foreign to this desert soil.\n\nWork here is in building, construction the lifeblood of this growing town. So I toil in the trade, hanging drywall, setting T-bars, and I see in the wide spaces the future that unsettles me. I fled the clamor of a grand city and have no yearning to return. But the desert holds its charms beyond the human sphere. Creatures creep and scuttle, the life of the land as much a part of it as the sand and sun. My children, three of them, chase lizards and bugs with a zeal that only the young possess. They are learning the ways of this place, as I have. People come here, drawn by the stark beauty of the desert, a beauty that demands respect. There are those who seek to understand this land, to live in harmony with its wild denizens.\n\nAnd should you find yourself in Victorville, know there are sights to see. The San Bernardino County Fair, with its bustle and clamor, offers a glimpse of desert life. There are mountains, too, in Wrightwood, where the snow caps the peaks and winter sports await. For those intrigued by the history etched into this land, the Victor Valley Museum stands as a testament to the tale of this place—its rocks and bones, its people and past. Here is the story of a land that endures, a city that grows, and a life lived under the vast and open sky.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, the tale I tell is likely a singular one. Where others might speak of homes and lives apart, mine is a little different. I reckon my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the folk in my dormitory, they are my kin. The land that stretches out around the campus, I consider it too, though it holds less sway. Despite this oddness, my neighborhood bears familiar marks of what a neighborhood ought to be. Just like any other, it has its dwellings, its people, its shops, and its parks. Let us begin with the dwellings that shape my home. Before venturing into the details of these abodes, it’s wise to make clear the sorts that stand here. Three kinds of housing lie within my reach: the apartments, the true houses, and the dormitory halls. First, in the apartments, you’ll find two to four souls in most rooms, with four to six such rooms per floor. Most rise to two floors, hosting around twenty or so folk in each. Second, the actual houses, open to anyone with ties to the school, these typically have two to four bedrooms, often filled by alumni. But few as they are, spread thin across the land, for they’re not the most efficient. Lastly, the dorm rooms, holding hundreds, where two share a room, mostly, the most common sight in my neighborhood. With the dwellings told, we move to the people. My school, proud of its diversity, shows it in the faces of my neighborhood. From all cultures, all ages, they come. The staff, they dwell in houses here, while newer students find rest in the dorms, and the older ones take to the apartments. Words alone can’t capture the lives here, so we turn to the shops and parks. The school, a world unto itself, boasts a bounty of stores and a single park. The shops offer food as any other place might, alongside the school’s own garb and goods. All one needs can be found within these bounds. The park, a haven for all, kept clean and safe by those who call this place their own.",
            "There’s a place where the sidewalks are a scarce commodity and the land itself seems to draw everything down toward the sea. My house perches atop the steepest hill in these parts, a hill the locals dub the \"work out hill\" for the joggers who brave its incline as part of their daily ritual. The street is devoid of pavements and so the people trod upon the asphalt itself, the road a pocked and pitted thing, treacherous to traverse. Overhead, lines of wire sag and sway, their tattered forms testament to the gales and tempests that batter this region. The storms lay waste to the branches and fling them against the power lines, leaving behind a patchwork of hurried repairs. \n\nThe evergreens stand tall and resolute, yet they are despised by those who dwell here for they barricade the ocean from sight. Thus, the houses rise up in defiance, their glass facades reaching for the bay, yearning for the sunset's glow when the water catches fire from below and the heavens blaze orange. But more often than not, a curtain of cloud hangs heavy in the sky and the light filters through a shroud. The days are damp and overcast, and moss finds a home on every surface, creeping across roofs, cars, railings. I left my own vehicle in the driveway for a spell and when I returned to it, the moss had made it a green and furry beast. Took me three hours to scrape it clean.\n\nChildren are a rarity here, though not so far away a school stands. The inhabitants are mostly the elder sort, many having set down the burdens of work for the quiet of retirement. In place of children, the people keep dogs, roaming the lawns and streets, slipping through open doors like thieves. I had to chase one from my own living room once, back out into the world. The rabbits run wild, unbidden, and the gardeners curse their burrowing ways. My cats, though, delight in the hunt and have driven them from our midst. \n\nBirds populate the skies, small sparrows and the occasional hummingbird flitting about, while now and again a hawk or eagle soars until the crows, ever vigilant, rise up to chase it away. No stores grace this neighborhood, but should you venture down to the water’s edge, a few establishments serve the bounty of the sea. There’s little beach to speak of, just rocks to fling into the bay. It’s not a vast expanse of water, for on a clear day you can glimpse the far shore, even through the mist that clings to the land.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies Bensonhurst, a place easy enough to find with the city's public transit lines weaving through like veins. The neighborhood is a patchwork of urban sprawl, its streets bustling with the pulse of New York City. Walk these streets and the signs of change are plain to see. Asian markets and laundries stand sentinel at every block, their presence born of a tide that swept in over twenty years past. The fare within these markets is fine and their prices fair, drawing the locals with a promise of quality and convenience, a testament to the city's melting pot.\n\nWithin a stone's throw from where I stand, four Asian markets vie for patronage, a testament to the ease with which one might fill their larder. Yet, Bensonhurst is not solely the realm of one people. It is a mosaic, a home to all manner of folk, immigrants and the children born of their dreams on American soil. The businesses, large and small, echo this diversity, though many bear the marks of their Asian founders.\n\nNearby, a park sprawls, a sanctuary of grass and asphalt. Basketball courts lie side by side, a field open for the passions of soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, and playgrounds, all the apparatus of childhood and leisure. In summer, the water fountain is a beacon for children seeking respite from the heat. Here too, the tapestry of humanity is woven tight, a diverse crowd at play beneath the sun.\n\nThe skyline is free of corporate giants, instead offering co-ops and condos, the humble abodes of two-family homes. The people, for all their noise and bustle, wear their kindness openly. Yet, the night holds its own counsel, and it is wise to tread with caution. Safety is a fragile thing, and the streets can harbor those with mischief in their hearts. I've known the sting of fists in this place, though the years have dulled those memories. Packages vanish from stoops, the work of unseen hands.\n\nAnd then there is the matter of the dogs. Though the city demands its citizens clean after their beasts, the law is oft ignored. Each dawn reveals new evidence of canine disregard, a trail of filth that mars the path to train and market alike. Such things are a thorn in one's side, a reminder to watch one's step and keep one's shoes unsullied.",
            "In the heart of Oregon lies Portland, a city that wears the word \"weird\" like a totem, a testament etched upon the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, a bar, a music hall, a strip club, defying the statutes of man and sense alike. This is a city whose anthem, \"Keep Portland Weird,\" whispers of a time when the streets were less traveled, when the cost was a pittance and creativity sprouted from the cracks in the sidewalk, a Portland of the 90s and early 2000s. To some, it is a siren's call, a beckoning to a land where being called weird is a badge of honor, a testament to individuality. Despite the tide of Californians with their gold rush dreams and the rise of towers to house them, Portland stands strange and proud. Weirdness here is no blind acceptance, but a welcoming of the unaccepted. It does not forsake the modern world's trappings; we too have our wares from China. There are a million ways to be weird, a million ways to defy the norm, yet Portland holds its share of the ordinary. Here, the yoga mats unfurl and the hipsters sip their brews, the business folk stride with purpose. Perhaps weirdness means we hold these things lightly, with a touch less gravity. In my neighborhood, as in many others, houses wear coats of many colors, gardens spill their bounty of flowers and herbs and vegetables along the streets, and in the warmth of summer, free boxes appear. They are often cardboard, sometimes plastic, filled with the castaways of another, yet holding magic for the passerby, more often than not. Clothes, books, and the unexpected lie within. This magic, this serendipity, is the soul of Portland. But this is merely my Portland, one thread in a tapestry of thousands. There are those among us who would not deign to pluck their attire from a box left upon the curb. They find their calling in goat yoga, where creatures bleat among the poses, or in the roar of Timbers games. Portland is a city of passions, dreams pursued or dreamt of in bars as the hours slip away. Yet, beneath it all, lies a shadow. A pall of rain and cloud that weighs heavy, feeding a drug problem born of minds in turmoil. And with it, the specter of homelessness, a problem with no easy cure. Our services draw the lost, better than most, yet still wanting. The housed waver between care and disdain, a dance not peculiar to this city. In that, Portland is not so strange after all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal, fixed in the northern sky, silent witnesses to the sun's passage at dusk and dawn. They abide in their steadfastness, unyielding to the ceaseless clamor of human endeavor, indifferent to the fretful stirrings of our lives. Yet in moments of turmoil, when the world seems to claw at the seams of one's soul, they summon me with their immutable presence. I find solace in their quiet strength, a balm for the weary heart, a whisper of endurance through the days that unfold one after the other. \n\nIt was when I first arrived as a callow student, the northern giants held me in thrall, their austere grandeur surpassing the university's charms of brick and water and foliage. The campus, with its own splendor, shared space in my heart, but it was the mountains that claimed dominion. The town itself unfolds in quiet beauty, its cafés warm with the hum of scholarly toil, the scent of coffee a constant companion. A short journey to the downtown reveals a place where time lingers, the old bricks of eateries and offices standing in testament to lives lived in quiet busyness. Here, the town pulses with a vitality that mirrors the nearby city, yet only for a fleeting moment before one is drawn back to the quietude of library and street.\n\nThis juxtaposition of worlds, so close yet distinct, lends the city an air of mystery, enticing exploration. It is a place of memories, each street and corner a repository of the past. Nights spent beneath rusted swings in parks, laughter echoing under a starless sky, or the frantic dash through city streets to a theater's embrace, gifts from the university’s coffers. Yet, as with all places, it bears witness to the bitter as well as the sweet. The ponds, by moonlight or under a sky of leaden clouds, become a sanctuary for reflection, a silent witness to the tears of those lost in the labyrinth of their own making. \n\nIn the company of turtles and ducks and the small lives that inhabit the water's edge, I pondered the inscrutable purpose of my own existence, adrift in the shadow of life's enigma. Past pond and park and suburban houses, I walked until the street opened up before me. In that moment, the sun, breaking through the palm-fringed sky, cast its light upon me. I turned my gaze northward, and there they stood, the mountains, their silhouette etched against the morn's awakening. They spoke in silence, a call to perseverance, their grandeur a testament to resilience, more enduring than any edifice man might raise.",
            "You might look right past it, not giving it a second thought, for it lies behind a shopping strip in a residential sprawl, a place where living seems an odd venture. Not the sort of place folks would choose, in any case. Yet if you wander beyond the old, forsaken Whole Foods and slip past the hotels that find life only once a year, save for the summer gatherings of kin, there you'll uncover a thriving enclave. Upon those lanes, within that hidden quarter, the apartments stand, stacked like Russian dolls, each nestled meticulously beside the other, forming a mosaic down the street. The first of these apartments have been whispered about on the news for tales unsavory and we won't linger there, for the surface often hides much. But the others, their neighbors, form a realm unto themselves, a secret kept from the very town that surrounds them. Across from these buildings rests the quiet campus of a community college, its structures solemnly keeping watch over the road. Here, students drift in with coffee cups clutched in sleepy hands, yawning as dawn breaks, their days just beginning. The iron gates creak open, one by one admitting the somnolent learners, while drivers curse them under their breath, caught in the morning snarl of higher attendance. The road forks into another residential path, flanked by a park and a clinic where those with fractured bones find solace. The clinic wears a cheerful facade with porch chairs basking in the languid churn of ceiling fans that stir the thick summer air. Across the way, children dash through the grass, their laughter spinning through the air while bees meander through roadside blooms. The elderly amble along the path with dogs in tow, frowning at the youth on skateboards, nodding politely to the girls huddled by the swings, whispering about boys and the latest digital craze. Nearby, a sushi joint in a strip mall offers cheap fare and yet seldom draws a crowd. Adjacent, a swim shop and a nail salon huddle close, a testament to the strip mall's convenience. You might ready your pool, primp your nails, and feast on hibachi all in one go. There's a self-serve frozen yogurt spot too, where teens often clutch cold, sweating cups, toppings piled high, as they skate and puff on their vapes, believing themselves the epitome of cool. This neighborhood, it's a slice of Americana, a relic of the languid South where even time itself seems reluctant to move.",
            "The neighborhood stands with a kind of mute defiance, a testament to a bygone era when the American dream was a tangible thing, woven into the fabric of suburbia like the threads of an old quilt. Most houses stand alone, solitary in their design, but there are those that cleaved themselves in twain, still joined at the hip like reluctant siblings. My own house bears a small patch of grass out front, a modest driveway to its left, whispering of a time not so distant when such things were the height of aspiration. The dream seems to have receded, drawing back as the tide, but the neighborhood remains, a stubborn remnant, calling out to those who pass through that the dream is not entirely lost. We hold on, though our grip may falter.\n\nThe people here, their optimism dulled by time, tend to their yards with a certain neglect. Yet the driveways remain populated with vehicles, evidence of life persisting. Children play in the streets, their laughter echoing off the asphalt, as if this small world were all that ever was or ever would be. The old school, nearly a century in its vigil, still stands, conjuring futures for the young while stirring memories in the old. Churches stand sparse, their pews empty, while the basketball courts ring with the sound of youth. The houses, though varied in their facades, share a sameness, a unity beneath their disparate exteriors.\n\nA supermarket looms large, its name \"Super A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs here, among a majority African American community. The streets are wide, accommodating the children’s games of football, paused only for the passage of cars. Generations have walked these streets, spun tales of a time when every neighbor was a friend. A karate school once thrived, yet fell when the allure of cinematic martial arts waned, giving way to a pharmacy, for the modern cure is often found in a bottle, or so it is said.\n\nA movie theater, small and quaint, screens old films at a price that draws the elders while the young turn away, seeking newer pastures. The expressway cuts through, but its exits lie beyond our borders, a decision born of the elders' will, fearing the ruin such accessibility might bring. A new high school rises, and with it the debate over a mascot. I ponder a cyborg with a country drawl, a log cabin standing firm, a fitting emblem for this place that is at once of the past and the future.",
            "In the heart of the city vast and sprawling there lies a neighborhood of a thousand faces, each different as the next. The streets wind and weave between blocks of commerce and solace, shops and eateries clustered like stars in a disordered sky. Grand offices rise and fall in the midst of humble stores, each vying for space among the din of life and laughter. New places to dine and shop are born each day, as restless hands build upon the land. The great brands and small boutiques coexist in uneasy truce, their windows aglow with promise.\n\nThe streets are lined with these emporiums and eateries, a stone’s throw from neighborhoods that could be silent but for the hum of the city’s pulse. Parks lie scattered among the concrete, small havens where the young play beneath the watchful eyes of parents seeking respite. Here in this quarter of the city, a tapestry of humanity unfolds. You find the vibrant colors of an LGBTQ+ community, the solemn rhythm of Orthodox traditions, and the stories of those who have journeyed far from the lands of the former Soviet Union.\n\nBeyond, the city stretches further to encompass enclaves of every hue and origin. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia – each a world unto itself, separated by mere miles but sometimes an eternity in traffic. For in this city, the roads are like veins clogged with the lifeblood of its people, a journey of ten miles becoming an odyssey lasting hours. The foot is seldom favored, for the city’s expanse is daunting to any who might tread it.\n\nYet still they come, drawn to this place of dreams and promise. Towers rise anew, casting long shadows over those who lament the coming of more souls and more vehicles to clog the roads further. The houses here are varied as the people, some standing alone and proud, others joined in duplexes or gathered in modest apartments. The diversity of shelter echoes the diversity of life.\n\nIn this sea of humanity, I remain an island, adrift among strangers. The ties that once bound neighbor to neighbor have loosened, though memories linger of days spent in the company of childhood friends. The streets then were not so crowded, the air not so thick with the noise of the world. Yet here we are, each of us a part of this ever-evolving city, for better or for worse.",
            "The road stretched out before them, an endless ribbon of asphalt flanked by the solemn ranks of cornfields standing like sentinels beneath the vast sky. She looked out the window, her face a canvas of wonder and disbelief. Where is everything, she said. This is it, I told her, watching the horizon swallow her expectations, the land opening up like a story she’d never thought to read. She came from a place where the city murmured its comforts close at hand, a grocery store’s familiar glow but a scant five minutes' stroll from her door. But here, the world unfolded in its raw expanse, a tableau of solitude and earth.\n\nAs we drove the winding two-lane road, I spoke of my upbringing amidst these fields, in the heart of rural Ohio where time moves with the rhythm of the seasons. There, past a quarry that lies like a forgotten lake, rests the small enclave I call home. The houses stand solid and stoic, their brick and stucco faces turned to the sun, each cradled by a half-acre of earth that blooms with the pride of its keepers. In spring, the land bursts forth in color, flowers spilling over the soil, trees unfurling their leaves in a symphony of life.\n\nThe driveways gleam with the sheen of polished Mercedes Benzes, a testament to the quiet prosperity of this place. My neighbor, a man with a face carved by years and wisdom, tends his lawn with a mower's drone and a song on his lips. His presence is a constant in the neighborhood, a figure of gentle humor and deep history, once a healer, now content amidst the grass and the hum of his John Deere.\n\nAnd then there is my home, its grey stucco walls a familiar embrace. In the side yard, geese wander, pursued by the exuberant scrambles of our Terrier. Beyond the back, a stream whispers its way toward the quarry, a symphony of frogs and the distant lowing of cattle marking the air. Across a bridge of worn wood lies a sanctuary untouched by human hand, where trees rise in their natural state, herbs and wildflowers paint the earth. It is here my childhood was spent, in forts built of dreams and chases that were more play than hunt, the laughter of neighborhood children echoing through the days.\n\nWinters here are a stark beauty, a transformation from the verdant to the barren. Trees stand stripped to their essence against the iron sky, and when snow graces the earth, it blankets the world in silence and wonder. My sister and I, we were fierce in our play, snowballs our chosen arms, forts our bastions. In that world of white, we wove our tales, young and unburdened by the weight of years. Our wonderland, our battleground, a place where the heart learned to dream."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the quiet heart of Rural America, where the land stretches wide and flat, lies a small town in Michigan. It's a place where the earth rolls from farmland to fleeting tourist havens. There are no sprawling malls, no Wal-marts or Targets, not even the comforting familiarity of an Applebee’s. Any destination demands a journey by road. Yet, despite its remoteness, it is a land graced by water. This town, if you could call it that, is cradled by the waters of the world, with Lake Michigan sprawling on one side and the clear depths of Lake Charlevoix on the other. Wherever the road takes you, there is always a beach, a place to feel the cold bite of water against skin.\n\nThe town embodies the essence of a small community. Homes here do not stand in uniform rows, one indistinguishable from the next, but rather they are relics of another time. Some bear the marks of modernization, while others cling to their age with quiet dignity. Basements lie beneath most, visible from the street as you pass by. The aluminum siding of the past still clings to many, painted in every shade you can conceive. Yards are a common sight, with trampolines and playsets, gardens and fences guarding the animals within. It is Middle America, where people toil in earnest, raising families or watching them move on.\n\nOn any given day, children race through the streets, their laughter trailing like comets in the air. Dogs are walked, bicycles whir past, and the sound of rollerblades whispers against the pavement. This is a place where neighbors know each other, where a wave or a smile is exchanged as naturally as the air is breathed. Lawns are tended with care, grass kept short, leaves banished with the turning of the seasons. It is not a place of striking beauty, but rather one of quiet assurance, a testament to the simple dream of safety and peace.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff's department stands watch, the health department close by, and the city recycling center serves the needs of all. The fields for baseball and softball are alive with the echoes of announcers calling names and scores. Planes from the small airport rumble in the distance, a gentle reminder of the world beyond. An ice cream shop beckons within walking distance, and downtown is just a stretch further. The park, a mere eight blocks away, calls out to children with its promise of adventure. It is a place that holds its own in the world, not for grandeur, but for the comfort it offers those who call it home.",
            "The place where I dwell could be likened to a tableau of suburban sameness, each abode a mirror of the next. The hand of the homeowner's association is heavy upon this land, its presence felt in the pristine facades and manicured lawns. As you cross the invisible boundary into this enclave, you are greeted by a parade of single-story homes, each standing in solemn order, their guardianship enforced by that unseen council. The front yards are a patchwork of green, punctuated by stones that serve no purpose but to be seen and driveways that barely stretch the length of a vehicle. Trees, stunted and sparse, mark the passage of your journey, and each house boasts a garage for two. The roads are smooth as glass, unmarred by time or use, a testament to the vigilance of those who govern this place.\n\nThese houses, they rise mostly to a single story, though now and again, you'll see one that dares to reach higher. The mailboxes are clustered like a flock at the end of the street, an assembly line of metal that requires a key to access one's own. For parcels, there are larger lockers, all part of the HOA's grand design for order. My home sits on the fringe of the city, a liminal space where the urban bleeds into the rural, granting us expanses of land for our purposes. Community pools lie scattered, open to all who reside here, their waters kept clean under lock and key. Paths wind through the neighborhood, inviting the solitary walker or the companioned dog, offering a journey without the need for parks.\n\nThe air here is one of safety, a collective watchfulness among neighbors, most of whom have traded their working days for the quietude of retirement. Yet, scattered among them are the younger souls, professionals who find solace in this orderly refuge. The city beyond is vast, teeming with people yet retaining the essence of a small town. It holds the conveniences of modern life, a single mall its crown jewel, modest but sufficient. A brief drive of fifteen minutes brings forth a bounty of choices, from the organic riches of upscale grocers to the austerity of discount outlets where staff are few and goods are fewer.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, defined by its safety and its sameness, its pools and paths, a haven not far from the commerce of the city, where a car can whisk you to any chain store your heart desires.",
            "The first time I heard of the place it was through the crackling voice of a podcast speaking of the missing. A surprise like a whisper in a crowd. In a world where apartments cost beyond the reach of most, a thousand dollars a month seemed a distant memory. None of us had heard the tale. Perhaps it's the struggle that binds us. I know folks who weep into the night as if the silence held answers. Life's costly but we've learned the way of the frugal. The scent of flea market toys and clothes tucked away with mothballs becomes familiar. In the years of growing, you catch fewer scents. Perhaps you begin to smoke or simply grow accustomed to the way of things. Yet, the flea market persists. Adulthood smells of dusty magazines balanced on a piano long since silenced. It stains the leather and lingers through the wash. Three thrift stores stand within a short walk. Start on the far side, and you'll find charity thrifts, a library, rare books, and a shop of curiosities. Downtown is thick with people and cars each morning but inside the thrifts, silence reigns. The city moves around you like a river but within these walls, time stands. A good place to lose an afternoon. Each year more cars, more people. They call it progress. A city developing under the weight of its own ambition, home to an empire of e-commerce and delivery still grappling with its own growth. It echoes New York where paths cross without pause and no one asks anything of you. Solitude is a given, and folks let you be. Not like the South where concern is a currency of care. Here, lives remain untouched unless invited. You wear your shell as long as you wish and the city ebbs and flows like the tide against the shore. A place alive with sound, the pianist next door and singers above make their music. Not strangers but a gathering of kin. We meet needs, mark time with birthdays and farewells, lend help as it's needed. I'm fortunate to be here. These neighbors, they are good folk. We tidy after ourselves, share food. I deliver mail and they do the same. A nod and a smile. In this sprawling modern expanse, it's the people who remind me that life is not entirely misspent.",
            "In this small town of the Midwest, set a stone's throw from the city's sprawling suburbs, there is a quietude that belies the struggles beneath. The east side, where I make my home, is a place of low roofs and low fortunes, where souls walk the line between want and resolve. The houses stand in long rows, some owned and some rented by those who count their days in pennies and dimes. Yet the streets breathe with a certain warmth, the kind that comes when a neighbor tips his hat in passing or a child waves from a doorstep.\n\nThough shadows of violence have touched these streets, they do not linger long. A shooting here, a life taken too soon, and the sorrow of a neighbor's loss becomes the community's burden. The memory of a young life lost outside a bar hangs heavy, yet the quiet resilience of the people holds it at bay.\n\nThis town, like many others, bears the scars of the opioid scourge, a plague that has claimed more lives than the mind dares to tally. Fentanyl, the name whispered in fear, has laid low the strongest, but the town fights back with what means it can muster. Clinics and centers rise to meet the challenge, and hands reach out with Narcan and hope.\n\nAmidst these trials, there are reasons to hold fast. The school where my son learns is a sanctuary of kindness and promise, where no child is cast aside for their needs or their family's means. The teachers and staff, they stand as sentinels of a brighter tomorrow, guiding young minds with patience and care. The community gathers, parents and children alike, in the school’s embrace, where no stomach goes empty and no spirit goes unkindled.\n\nYet, the heart of this town is not evenly adorned. The center and the west have been given new face with paved roads and tended parks, while the east side waits its turn. But here, where my family has made its life for sixteen years, there is a contentment that cannot be paved over or landscaped away. The streets may be worn, but they are ours, and the life we lead here is one we would not trade.\n\nSo we stay, in this town of contradictions and quiet joys, where the heart knows both its burdens and its blessings. It is a good place, and it is home.",
            "In the neighborhood where I dwell, culture lays its roots deep in the earth, and the hill upon which it rests is circled by edifices that whisper tales of old. I reside in a seven-story building shadowed by the ancient Theater, its bricks heavy with memory. Down the hill lies a quaint arcade bar, where on sultry summer nights, the people gather like moths to a flame. On weekends, come June or July, they queue patiently, a testament to the draw of simple pleasures. Up the road, the city park sprawls, an expanse of green bordered by concrete, with stairs carved into the stone like steps to some forgotten altar. \n\nWinter brings with it the unforgiving chill, and the homeless seek refuge, their tents arrayed in tidy lines along the sidewalks and steps, defiant against the rain that falls with the relentlessness of time. Here they find what warmth they can, shielded somewhat by the city’s heart, within reach of the family center where they might restore their dignity, if only for a moment.\n\nYet it is not the grandeur of history that binds my heart to this city. It is the people. Hilltop, once a land of shadows and violence, still bears the scars of those days. The tales linger, passed down like heirlooms, of the time when the streets were swept clean by federal hands. The past is etched in the memory of the people, a caution and a legacy. They labor now, their efforts visible in the grit and care that mark their homes and streets. \n\nThere are those who whisper warnings of the night, cautioning against the shadows that linger still. But the words taste of fear born from old wounds. Maybe it’s that my skin bears a hue that blends in the twilight, or perhaps Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the weight of history. Here, in this supposed utopia of cultures, the reminders of prejudice and fear run deep, yet I find a solace in the truth of these streets.\n\nNo matter where my feet may wander, this place remains my anchor. The night breathes life into my soul as I walk among those who would offer warmth over harm. It is here that the laundromat doors remain open a moment longer, a small mercy against the storm. Here, where I sit, believing myself unseen, only to be met with kindness, a stranger’s gift and words that lift the spirit. Hilltop is a mosaic, imperfect yet beautiful, and in its embrace, I find my home.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, the air thick with the promise of beginnings. Friends did not come easy then, but in time I drew close to a boy two doors down and another who lived further along the lane. They are gone now, but the echoes of our laughter linger in the quiet of these streets. The faces I first met here remain for the most part, like the steady rhythm of a familiar song. This place is not unlike any other suburban sprawl you might find in America, all two-storied houses standing sentinel. On weekends, or when the sun smiles warmly upon us, the voices of children rise like birdsong in the air. The week wears a cloak of silence, broken only by the ebb and flow of life. I've never crossed words with neighbors, left to my solitude unless aid is called for. Packages arrive unmolested on the porch, a testament to the trust that binds us. A park lies but a minute's breath from my door, a repository of memories both bright and bruised. I have run the courts of basketball and the fields of football and baseball with the boys who once roamed this earth with me. It was there I took an elbow to the nose, a bitter memory softened by the sweetness of all the rest. Now, the park serves as a playground for my cousin's young ones, their joy rekindling the nostalgia that tugs at my heart. Diversity walks these streets. Within a mile’s reach, you might sample the world—Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian. Though many now summon their sustenance through GrubHub or DoorDash, the fast food joints remain a constant, as they do in suburbs across the land. Pizza too, aplenty. The stores hold all manner of necessity. Dry cleaners dot the vicinity, and a Walgreens stands with a CVS and Jewel-Osco, staples of the Midwest. Some shops hold the flavors of faraway places, an Indian store offering a taste of home or the makings of it. This neighborhood holds my favor, for it has spared me the trials I read of in the flickering stories of others, leaving me grateful for the peace that resides here.",
            "The place where I rest my head is close by the college, and for this I find a certain comfort in its proximity. The neighborhood is a tapestry of old apartment buildings, some worn by time, yet mingled with a handful of eateries and taverns that offer a modest reprieve at a fair cost. One tavern recently donned a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though the spirits they pour and the service rendered are not of the worst sort. The souls you'll meet are mostly kind, a blend of the young scholars and those of lesser means, for the rent is not a heavy burden to bear. Children are plentiful, drawn to the nearby elementary school that lies a short walk from my door. My neighbors remain strangers to me, and that suits me fine. They indulge in the smoke of the earth, prompting the building's overseer to install a fragrant contraption by their threshold, which my companion and I found amusing, if not a touch offensive. The structures around me bear the marks of age, some cloaked in antiquity, though their insides may have been dressed anew. A short distance away stand the newly minted dwellings, though their rapid rise betrays a shoddy craft. Their cost is dear, a testament to their nearness to the college, allowing the keepers of these places to demand such a ransom. There’s a humble eatery a stone's throw from my abode, serving meals on paper like a picnic, their offerings warmed by the hum of microwaves. Across the way looms a gas station, reputed to be a less than pleasant place of work. Yet the city, with a generous hand, saw fit to lay fresh tarmac upon the road last summer, crafting a wide path for walking and softening the view with grass. My dwelling lies ensconced in trees, their numbers diminished by the axe yet still plentiful compared to the bare streets down yonder. Behind the apartments, a line of woodland stands guard, and beyond it, more homes. I reside on 42nd street, beyond which lies 43rd, a road less cared for, its sidewalks crumbling and its buildings weary. There are trees aplenty, serving as a veil for the decrepitude. Crime casts its shadow there, though not solely there, as the apartments across from my own harbor their share of trouble and transience. Despite it all, I find a certain affection for this place. It is within my means, and the conveniences nearby serve me well. The university is but a short stroll away, and two bus stops grant me easy passage to the grocer and the heart of the town.",
            "In a quiet enclave, the duplexes stood in their yellow and white uniformity, like sentinels on the cul-de-sac. They masqueraded as singular abodes but for the hue of their porches and their green metallic crowns, a collective facade. In this place, most were bound by a thread of kinship, gathering at the ends of driveways not by design but by a shared impulse, their voices mingling with the laughter of children at play. The world beyond, with its relentless march of technology, seemed distant here. Time itself seemed to slow, surrounded as we were by the endless fields and the stoic trees beneath the vast sky, blue and cloud-strewn.\n\nThe season had brought with it the specter of storms, and the sirens that pierced the evening were a harbinger of nature's fury. I took refuge in the tub, clutching my smallest dog as though he might anchor me against the tempest. My larger companion, wary and restless, stood sentinel in the living room, his barks a counterpoint to the hail that drummed upon the earth. The storm passed, and steam rose ghostlike from the asphalt, the air cooling rapidly from the sweltering heat. The hail vanished, surrendering to the ground's warmth, and as the storm's curtain lifted, the sun emerged—its light refracted in a double arc of colors that hung in the sky like a promise. I captured that moment, a testament to fleeting beauty, to share with those far and near. Awe was shared across distances, and gradually, life resumed its rhythm, the neighborhood returning to its accustomed ease.\n\nFor one who has traversed from the chill of New Hampshire to the warmth of North Carolina, this place is a marvel. The southern drawl lingers in the air like a song half-remembered. Here, each apartment mirrors the next in outward appearance, yet within, they are worlds apart. In the wide field beyond my door, I wander to the pond, a sanctuary not meant for swimming. Deer roam, and in the dawn, the bullfrog's call echoes—a baritone note in the symphony of morning. The city of Charlotte lies but forty minutes away, yet this village holds its own counsel. Roosters herald the day, and at dusk, the donkey's bray resounds from a neighboring farm, a reminder of another world. Here, I found a refuge, a sanctuary among the yellow houses of the cul-de-sac.",
            "Ten years I've been in this place and it's a stretch of time long enough to see things clear. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge and I reckon I wept then when the moving trucks rolled away and I watched the town I loved shrink to nothing. But my folks, they sought a better life for us, me and my little sister, and so we found ourselves in a place where the houses stood prouder and the schools promised more. The clamor of the city dimmed and the streets were quiet in ways I hadn't known. Over time I learned the lay of the land, made friends and a few enemies as it goes. The neighbors mostly kept to themselves save for Mr. Glen and his kin and Dennis who lived beside us. They were kind folks and in them I found something akin to family. There was a time we all went to Mr. Glen's wedding, the second one, and it was a good day full of laughter and promises. I caught the garter Miss Veda tossed, though not the flowers, and danced beneath a sky full of stars with Marsharii, their daughter. She vanished from my life like a whisper on the wind, but I hope she's found her way to brighter days. The neighborhood is a tangle of streets and secrets, but I've got a GPS now and it affords me the chance to wander further. With Kason and Curtis, we'd lose ourselves in games and the untroubled joy of youth. Sometimes I'd find solace in the park, the quiet of the trees wrapping around me like an old comfort. I'd practice balance on sticks from the depot and swing my bokken sword at the air like a boy at play. The courts stand idle, but their promise still holds should the urge to play ever strike me again. My father, he taught me and my best friend the art of tennis under the watchful eye of Mr. Graves. They pushed us hard, but the laughter always came easy. This place holds a trove of memories, stories that have etched themselves into the marrow of my bones. Yet I reckon the best lies still ahead, waiting patiently down the winding road.",
            "In the quiet breath of South Carolina lies a town that hardly catches the eye and yet holds a weight upon the earth with its call to the harvest. Johnston, they say, the Peach Capital of the World, and they’ve hammered it into the sign that greets the weary traveler. Fields stretch out like a tapestry woven by old hands, peach orchards and cattle grazing in the sun’s relentless gaze. Homes here, they’re set apart like solitary sentinels, two stories high with roofs of metal or gray shingles to fend off the summer’s fiery wrath. They sit back from the road, the land before them a stage for crops and beasts.\n\nIn the heart of town, where the single stoplight dangles over the four-way, the commerce of Johnston is laid bare. Three places offer fast food, though fast is a relative term. A family runs a small Chinese joint called Hong Kong, and there’s Fiesta Mexican, and a little burger place named Gary’s. The pizzeria’s doors have long since shut. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family pharmacy, is known less for medicine and more for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There’s the IGA, a grocery store steeped in its own cost, yet folks prefer the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their weekly provisions.\n\nDollar General stands as the town’s beating heart, a repository of life’s essentials, bustling from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More is a place of dreams and shadows, run by a woman whose kindness is as much a fixture as the furniture she sells. A small pet grooming shop, Clark’s Cuts and Kennels, clings to its side, offering care to the creatures of the town. Further out lie the doctor’s office and veterinary practice, small yet capable, tending to the bodies of Johnston’s people and their beasts. \n\nThere’s but one school for the town’s young, Johnston Elementary, and when the children grow beyond, they must journey to another place for their learning. The town dreams of a park, a 2.5-acre haven for families and wanderers alike, yet it remains a promise, not yet fulfilled. There’s no cinema, no lanes for bowling, no places where the young might gather, no parks for the children or paths for the pets. Johnston’s a simple place, a blink in the rearview, and yet there’s a charm that lingers like a whisper carried on the wind.",
            "I find myself in a place that might be called ordinary, a suburb nestled in the small southern expanse of Tennessee where the roads meet, and in that meeting, traffic finds its way more than I'd prefer. A quiet place nonetheless, a neighborhood where faces have grown familiar, settled like dust that seldom stirs. Folks tend to their yards, the daily grind of chores a symphony of the mundane. In winter, the children take to sledding down the hill, laughter echoing in the air crisp with the season's breath. Our house sits perched at the front corner, watching with a silent gaze the comings and goings of all who pass, recognizing the vehicles as though they were the faces of old friends. Strangers are noted with a certain curiosity, a mark in the otherwise routine.\n\nNeighbors walk for exercise, or perhaps just to let their dogs trot beside them, the children weaving about on bicycles, a dance of innocence. We remain at home, our work anchored within its walls. Four we are—myself, my wife, and our daughters, aged eleven and fourteen—our presence as familiar to others as theirs is to us. We venture outside, embracing the elements, sometimes playing even when the rain falls hard. The grill on the back deck sends its pleasant aroma into the air, a smell of summer's promise. The hum of lawnmowers is a constant melody from March to October, interrupted only by the stillness that heralds the end of growth.\n\nTrees abound here, remnants of the woods that once claimed this land. They offer shade but also the burden of leaves come Fall, a task that calls for raking and burning, the smoke a signal of the season's change. Winter has been reluctant, stretching Fall into a long, drawn-out affair. At the back of our house lies the garage, the front door seldom used unless a rare visitor knocks. In the garage, I find solace in tinkering, a connection to the world beyond our doorstep when the doors are open.\n\nHolidays pass quietly, their presence marked by the gathering of families and the surplus of cars parked along the street. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas—all witness to the ebb and flow of visitors. In all this, there is a contentment in this place. Were it not for the thoroughfare, it might be perfect. But perhaps, even in imperfection, there lies a certain beauty.",
            "There’s a place out in the high desert, a place where the earth stretches out in endless hues of brown and dust, where the sun bakes the land into a hard canvas of desolation. Unless you’ve stood here, under this relentless sky, you might not comprehend the way the world turns to sepia before your eyes. A patch of green, a rare lawn, is a sign of fortune spent and labor endured. In the nineties, when first I came to call this place home, the houses lay scattered like bones upon the desert floor. Now, though the land remains vast, new structures rise stubbornly against the horizon. The city creeps closer, as cities do, but here in my neighborhood, the folks are kind. The old ones are friendly, and I suppose this marks it as a place of some goodness. Stores are chains, the kind you’d expect—Food 4 Less, Smart & Final. For something finer, you journey far, for Whole Foods and their ilk are foreign to this desert soil.\n\nWork here is in building, construction the lifeblood of this growing town. So I toil in the trade, hanging drywall, setting T-bars, and I see in the wide spaces the future that unsettles me. I fled the clamor of a grand city and have no yearning to return. But the desert holds its charms beyond the human sphere. Creatures creep and scuttle, the life of the land as much a part of it as the sand and sun. My children, three of them, chase lizards and bugs with a zeal that only the young possess. They are learning the ways of this place, as I have. People come here, drawn by the stark beauty of the desert, a beauty that demands respect. There are those who seek to understand this land, to live in harmony with its wild denizens.\n\nAnd should you find yourself in Victorville, know there are sights to see. The San Bernardino County Fair, with its bustle and clamor, offers a glimpse of desert life. There are mountains, too, in Wrightwood, where the snow caps the peaks and winter sports await. For those intrigued by the history etched into this land, the Victor Valley Museum stands as a testament to the tale of this place—its rocks and bones, its people and past. Here is the story of a land that endures, a city that grows, and a life lived under the vast and open sky.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, the tale I tell is likely a singular one. Where others might speak of homes and lives apart, mine is a little different. I reckon my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the folk in my dormitory, they are my kin. The land that stretches out around the campus, I consider it too, though it holds less sway. Despite this oddness, my neighborhood bears familiar marks of what a neighborhood ought to be. Just like any other, it has its dwellings, its people, its shops, and its parks. Let us begin with the dwellings that shape my home. Before venturing into the details of these abodes, it’s wise to make clear the sorts that stand here. Three kinds of housing lie within my reach: the apartments, the true houses, and the dormitory halls. First, in the apartments, you’ll find two to four souls in most rooms, with four to six such rooms per floor. Most rise to two floors, hosting around twenty or so folk in each. Second, the actual houses, open to anyone with ties to the school, these typically have two to four bedrooms, often filled by alumni. But few as they are, spread thin across the land, for they’re not the most efficient. Lastly, the dorm rooms, holding hundreds, where two share a room, mostly, the most common sight in my neighborhood. With the dwellings told, we move to the people. My school, proud of its diversity, shows it in the faces of my neighborhood. From all cultures, all ages, they come. The staff, they dwell in houses here, while newer students find rest in the dorms, and the older ones take to the apartments. Words alone can’t capture the lives here, so we turn to the shops and parks. The school, a world unto itself, boasts a bounty of stores and a single park. The shops offer food as any other place might, alongside the school’s own garb and goods. All one needs can be found within these bounds. The park, a haven for all, kept clean and safe by those who call this place their own.",
            "There’s a place where the sidewalks are a scarce commodity and the land itself seems to draw everything down toward the sea. My house perches atop the steepest hill in these parts, a hill the locals dub the \"work out hill\" for the joggers who brave its incline as part of their daily ritual. The street is devoid of pavements and so the people trod upon the asphalt itself, the road a pocked and pitted thing, treacherous to traverse. Overhead, lines of wire sag and sway, their tattered forms testament to the gales and tempests that batter this region. The storms lay waste to the branches and fling them against the power lines, leaving behind a patchwork of hurried repairs. \n\nThe evergreens stand tall and resolute, yet they are despised by those who dwell here for they barricade the ocean from sight. Thus, the houses rise up in defiance, their glass facades reaching for the bay, yearning for the sunset's glow when the water catches fire from below and the heavens blaze orange. But more often than not, a curtain of cloud hangs heavy in the sky and the light filters through a shroud. The days are damp and overcast, and moss finds a home on every surface, creeping across roofs, cars, railings. I left my own vehicle in the driveway for a spell and when I returned to it, the moss had made it a green and furry beast. Took me three hours to scrape it clean.\n\nChildren are a rarity here, though not so far away a school stands. The inhabitants are mostly the elder sort, many having set down the burdens of work for the quiet of retirement. In place of children, the people keep dogs, roaming the lawns and streets, slipping through open doors like thieves. I had to chase one from my own living room once, back out into the world. The rabbits run wild, unbidden, and the gardeners curse their burrowing ways. My cats, though, delight in the hunt and have driven them from our midst. \n\nBirds populate the skies, small sparrows and the occasional hummingbird flitting about, while now and again a hawk or eagle soars until the crows, ever vigilant, rise up to chase it away. No stores grace this neighborhood, but should you venture down to the water’s edge, a few establishments serve the bounty of the sea. There’s little beach to speak of, just rocks to fling into the bay. It’s not a vast expanse of water, for on a clear day you can glimpse the far shore, even through the mist that clings to the land.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies Bensonhurst, a place easy enough to find with the city's public transit lines weaving through like veins. The neighborhood is a patchwork of urban sprawl, its streets bustling with the pulse of New York City. Walk these streets and the signs of change are plain to see. Asian markets and laundries stand sentinel at every block, their presence born of a tide that swept in over twenty years past. The fare within these markets is fine and their prices fair, drawing the locals with a promise of quality and convenience, a testament to the city's melting pot.\n\nWithin a stone's throw from where I stand, four Asian markets vie for patronage, a testament to the ease with which one might fill their larder. Yet, Bensonhurst is not solely the realm of one people. It is a mosaic, a home to all manner of folk, immigrants and the children born of their dreams on American soil. The businesses, large and small, echo this diversity, though many bear the marks of their Asian founders.\n\nNearby, a park sprawls, a sanctuary of grass and asphalt. Basketball courts lie side by side, a field open for the passions of soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, and playgrounds, all the apparatus of childhood and leisure. In summer, the water fountain is a beacon for children seeking respite from the heat. Here too, the tapestry of humanity is woven tight, a diverse crowd at play beneath the sun.\n\nThe skyline is free of corporate giants, instead offering co-ops and condos, the humble abodes of two-family homes. The people, for all their noise and bustle, wear their kindness openly. Yet, the night holds its own counsel, and it is wise to tread with caution. Safety is a fragile thing, and the streets can harbor those with mischief in their hearts. I've known the sting of fists in this place, though the years have dulled those memories. Packages vanish from stoops, the work of unseen hands.\n\nAnd then there is the matter of the dogs. Though the city demands its citizens clean after their beasts, the law is oft ignored. Each dawn reveals new evidence of canine disregard, a trail of filth that mars the path to train and market alike. Such things are a thorn in one's side, a reminder to watch one's step and keep one's shoes unsullied.",
            "In the heart of Oregon lies Portland, a city that wears the word \"weird\" like a totem, a testament etched upon the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, a bar, a music hall, a strip club, defying the statutes of man and sense alike. This is a city whose anthem, \"Keep Portland Weird,\" whispers of a time when the streets were less traveled, when the cost was a pittance and creativity sprouted from the cracks in the sidewalk, a Portland of the 90s and early 2000s. To some, it is a siren's call, a beckoning to a land where being called weird is a badge of honor, a testament to individuality. Despite the tide of Californians with their gold rush dreams and the rise of towers to house them, Portland stands strange and proud. Weirdness here is no blind acceptance, but a welcoming of the unaccepted. It does not forsake the modern world's trappings; we too have our wares from China. There are a million ways to be weird, a million ways to defy the norm, yet Portland holds its share of the ordinary. Here, the yoga mats unfurl and the hipsters sip their brews, the business folk stride with purpose. Perhaps weirdness means we hold these things lightly, with a touch less gravity. In my neighborhood, as in many others, houses wear coats of many colors, gardens spill their bounty of flowers and herbs and vegetables along the streets, and in the warmth of summer, free boxes appear. They are often cardboard, sometimes plastic, filled with the castaways of another, yet holding magic for the passerby, more often than not. Clothes, books, and the unexpected lie within. This magic, this serendipity, is the soul of Portland. But this is merely my Portland, one thread in a tapestry of thousands. There are those among us who would not deign to pluck their attire from a box left upon the curb. They find their calling in goat yoga, where creatures bleat among the poses, or in the roar of Timbers games. Portland is a city of passions, dreams pursued or dreamt of in bars as the hours slip away. Yet, beneath it all, lies a shadow. A pall of rain and cloud that weighs heavy, feeding a drug problem born of minds in turmoil. And with it, the specter of homelessness, a problem with no easy cure. Our services draw the lost, better than most, yet still wanting. The housed waver between care and disdain, a dance not peculiar to this city. In that, Portland is not so strange after all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal, fixed in the northern sky, silent witnesses to the sun's passage at dusk and dawn. They abide in their steadfastness, unyielding to the ceaseless clamor of human endeavor, indifferent to the fretful stirrings of our lives. Yet in moments of turmoil, when the world seems to claw at the seams of one's soul, they summon me with their immutable presence. I find solace in their quiet strength, a balm for the weary heart, a whisper of endurance through the days that unfold one after the other. \n\nIt was when I first arrived as a callow student, the northern giants held me in thrall, their austere grandeur surpassing the university's charms of brick and water and foliage. The campus, with its own splendor, shared space in my heart, but it was the mountains that claimed dominion. The town itself unfolds in quiet beauty, its cafés warm with the hum of scholarly toil, the scent of coffee a constant companion. A short journey to the downtown reveals a place where time lingers, the old bricks of eateries and offices standing in testament to lives lived in quiet busyness. Here, the town pulses with a vitality that mirrors the nearby city, yet only for a fleeting moment before one is drawn back to the quietude of library and street.\n\nThis juxtaposition of worlds, so close yet distinct, lends the city an air of mystery, enticing exploration. It is a place of memories, each street and corner a repository of the past. Nights spent beneath rusted swings in parks, laughter echoing under a starless sky, or the frantic dash through city streets to a theater's embrace, gifts from the university’s coffers. Yet, as with all places, it bears witness to the bitter as well as the sweet. The ponds, by moonlight or under a sky of leaden clouds, become a sanctuary for reflection, a silent witness to the tears of those lost in the labyrinth of their own making. \n\nIn the company of turtles and ducks and the small lives that inhabit the water's edge, I pondered the inscrutable purpose of my own existence, adrift in the shadow of life's enigma. Past pond and park and suburban houses, I walked until the street opened up before me. In that moment, the sun, breaking through the palm-fringed sky, cast its light upon me. I turned my gaze northward, and there they stood, the mountains, their silhouette etched against the morn's awakening. They spoke in silence, a call to perseverance, their grandeur a testament to resilience, more enduring than any edifice man might raise.",
            "You might look right past it, not giving it a second thought, for it lies behind a shopping strip in a residential sprawl, a place where living seems an odd venture. Not the sort of place folks would choose, in any case. Yet if you wander beyond the old, forsaken Whole Foods and slip past the hotels that find life only once a year, save for the summer gatherings of kin, there you'll uncover a thriving enclave. Upon those lanes, within that hidden quarter, the apartments stand, stacked like Russian dolls, each nestled meticulously beside the other, forming a mosaic down the street. The first of these apartments have been whispered about on the news for tales unsavory and we won't linger there, for the surface often hides much. But the others, their neighbors, form a realm unto themselves, a secret kept from the very town that surrounds them. Across from these buildings rests the quiet campus of a community college, its structures solemnly keeping watch over the road. Here, students drift in with coffee cups clutched in sleepy hands, yawning as dawn breaks, their days just beginning. The iron gates creak open, one by one admitting the somnolent learners, while drivers curse them under their breath, caught in the morning snarl of higher attendance. The road forks into another residential path, flanked by a park and a clinic where those with fractured bones find solace. The clinic wears a cheerful facade with porch chairs basking in the languid churn of ceiling fans that stir the thick summer air. Across the way, children dash through the grass, their laughter spinning through the air while bees meander through roadside blooms. The elderly amble along the path with dogs in tow, frowning at the youth on skateboards, nodding politely to the girls huddled by the swings, whispering about boys and the latest digital craze. Nearby, a sushi joint in a strip mall offers cheap fare and yet seldom draws a crowd. Adjacent, a swim shop and a nail salon huddle close, a testament to the strip mall's convenience. You might ready your pool, primp your nails, and feast on hibachi all in one go. There's a self-serve frozen yogurt spot too, where teens often clutch cold, sweating cups, toppings piled high, as they skate and puff on their vapes, believing themselves the epitome of cool. This neighborhood, it's a slice of Americana, a relic of the languid South where even time itself seems reluctant to move.",
            "The neighborhood stands with a kind of mute defiance, a testament to a bygone era when the American dream was a tangible thing, woven into the fabric of suburbia like the threads of an old quilt. Most houses stand alone, solitary in their design, but there are those that cleaved themselves in twain, still joined at the hip like reluctant siblings. My own house bears a small patch of grass out front, a modest driveway to its left, whispering of a time not so distant when such things were the height of aspiration. The dream seems to have receded, drawing back as the tide, but the neighborhood remains, a stubborn remnant, calling out to those who pass through that the dream is not entirely lost. We hold on, though our grip may falter.\n\nThe people here, their optimism dulled by time, tend to their yards with a certain neglect. Yet the driveways remain populated with vehicles, evidence of life persisting. Children play in the streets, their laughter echoing off the asphalt, as if this small world were all that ever was or ever would be. The old school, nearly a century in its vigil, still stands, conjuring futures for the young while stirring memories in the old. Churches stand sparse, their pews empty, while the basketball courts ring with the sound of youth. The houses, though varied in their facades, share a sameness, a unity beneath their disparate exteriors.\n\nA supermarket looms large, its name \"Super A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs here, among a majority African American community. The streets are wide, accommodating the children’s games of football, paused only for the passage of cars. Generations have walked these streets, spun tales of a time when every neighbor was a friend. A karate school once thrived, yet fell when the allure of cinematic martial arts waned, giving way to a pharmacy, for the modern cure is often found in a bottle, or so it is said.\n\nA movie theater, small and quaint, screens old films at a price that draws the elders while the young turn away, seeking newer pastures. The expressway cuts through, but its exits lie beyond our borders, a decision born of the elders' will, fearing the ruin such accessibility might bring. A new high school rises, and with it the debate over a mascot. I ponder a cyborg with a country drawl, a log cabin standing firm, a fitting emblem for this place that is at once of the past and the future.",
            "In the heart of the city vast and sprawling there lies a neighborhood of a thousand faces, each different as the next. The streets wind and weave between blocks of commerce and solace, shops and eateries clustered like stars in a disordered sky. Grand offices rise and fall in the midst of humble stores, each vying for space among the din of life and laughter. New places to dine and shop are born each day, as restless hands build upon the land. The great brands and small boutiques coexist in uneasy truce, their windows aglow with promise.\n\nThe streets are lined with these emporiums and eateries, a stone’s throw from neighborhoods that could be silent but for the hum of the city’s pulse. Parks lie scattered among the concrete, small havens where the young play beneath the watchful eyes of parents seeking respite. Here in this quarter of the city, a tapestry of humanity unfolds. You find the vibrant colors of an LGBTQ+ community, the solemn rhythm of Orthodox traditions, and the stories of those who have journeyed far from the lands of the former Soviet Union.\n\nBeyond, the city stretches further to encompass enclaves of every hue and origin. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia – each a world unto itself, separated by mere miles but sometimes an eternity in traffic. For in this city, the roads are like veins clogged with the lifeblood of its people, a journey of ten miles becoming an odyssey lasting hours. The foot is seldom favored, for the city’s expanse is daunting to any who might tread it.\n\nYet still they come, drawn to this place of dreams and promise. Towers rise anew, casting long shadows over those who lament the coming of more souls and more vehicles to clog the roads further. The houses here are varied as the people, some standing alone and proud, others joined in duplexes or gathered in modest apartments. The diversity of shelter echoes the diversity of life.\n\nIn this sea of humanity, I remain an island, adrift among strangers. The ties that once bound neighbor to neighbor have loosened, though memories linger of days spent in the company of childhood friends. The streets then were not so crowded, the air not so thick with the noise of the world. Yet here we are, each of us a part of this ever-evolving city, for better or for worse.",
            "The road stretched out before them, an endless ribbon of asphalt flanked by the solemn ranks of cornfields standing like sentinels beneath the vast sky. She looked out the window, her face a canvas of wonder and disbelief. Where is everything, she said. This is it, I told her, watching the horizon swallow her expectations, the land opening up like a story she’d never thought to read. She came from a place where the city murmured its comforts close at hand, a grocery store’s familiar glow but a scant five minutes' stroll from her door. But here, the world unfolded in its raw expanse, a tableau of solitude and earth.\n\nAs we drove the winding two-lane road, I spoke of my upbringing amidst these fields, in the heart of rural Ohio where time moves with the rhythm of the seasons. There, past a quarry that lies like a forgotten lake, rests the small enclave I call home. The houses stand solid and stoic, their brick and stucco faces turned to the sun, each cradled by a half-acre of earth that blooms with the pride of its keepers. In spring, the land bursts forth in color, flowers spilling over the soil, trees unfurling their leaves in a symphony of life.\n\nThe driveways gleam with the sheen of polished Mercedes Benzes, a testament to the quiet prosperity of this place. My neighbor, a man with a face carved by years and wisdom, tends his lawn with a mower's drone and a song on his lips. His presence is a constant in the neighborhood, a figure of gentle humor and deep history, once a healer, now content amidst the grass and the hum of his John Deere.\n\nAnd then there is my home, its grey stucco walls a familiar embrace. In the side yard, geese wander, pursued by the exuberant scrambles of our Terrier. Beyond the back, a stream whispers its way toward the quarry, a symphony of frogs and the distant lowing of cattle marking the air. Across a bridge of worn wood lies a sanctuary untouched by human hand, where trees rise in their natural state, herbs and wildflowers paint the earth. It is here my childhood was spent, in forts built of dreams and chases that were more play than hunt, the laughter of neighborhood children echoing through the days.\n\nWinters here are a stark beauty, a transformation from the verdant to the barren. Trees stand stripped to their essence against the iron sky, and when snow graces the earth, it blankets the world in silence and wonder. My sister and I, we were fierce in our play, snowballs our chosen arms, forts our bastions. In that world of white, we wove our tales, young and unburdened by the weight of years. Our wonderland, our battleground, a place where the heart learned to dream."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the quiet heart of Rural America, where the land stretches wide and flat, lies a small town in Michigan. It's a place where the earth rolls from farmland to fleeting tourist havens. There are no sprawling malls, no Wal-marts or Targets, not even the comforting familiarity of an Applebee’s. Any destination demands a journey by road. Yet, despite its remoteness, it is a land graced by water. This town, if you could call it that, is cradled by the waters of the world, with Lake Michigan sprawling on one side and the clear depths of Lake Charlevoix on the other. Wherever the road takes you, there is always a beach, a place to feel the cold bite of water against skin.\n\nThe town embodies the essence of a small community. Homes here do not stand in uniform rows, one indistinguishable from the next, but rather they are relics of another time. Some bear the marks of modernization, while others cling to their age with quiet dignity. Basements lie beneath most, visible from the street as you pass by. The aluminum siding of the past still clings to many, painted in every shade you can conceive. Yards are a common sight, with trampolines and playsets, gardens and fences guarding the animals within. It is Middle America, where people toil in earnest, raising families or watching them move on.\n\nOn any given day, children race through the streets, their laughter trailing like comets in the air. Dogs are walked, bicycles whir past, and the sound of rollerblades whispers against the pavement. This is a place where neighbors know each other, where a wave or a smile is exchanged as naturally as the air is breathed. Lawns are tended with care, grass kept short, leaves banished with the turning of the seasons. It is not a place of striking beauty, but rather one of quiet assurance, a testament to the simple dream of safety and peace.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff's department stands watch, the health department close by, and the city recycling center serves the needs of all. The fields for baseball and softball are alive with the echoes of announcers calling names and scores. Planes from the small airport rumble in the distance, a gentle reminder of the world beyond. An ice cream shop beckons within walking distance, and downtown is just a stretch further. The park, a mere eight blocks away, calls out to children with its promise of adventure. It is a place that holds its own in the world, not for grandeur, but for the comfort it offers those who call it home.",
            "The place where I dwell could be likened to a tableau of suburban sameness, each abode a mirror of the next. The hand of the homeowner's association is heavy upon this land, its presence felt in the pristine facades and manicured lawns. As you cross the invisible boundary into this enclave, you are greeted by a parade of single-story homes, each standing in solemn order, their guardianship enforced by that unseen council. The front yards are a patchwork of green, punctuated by stones that serve no purpose but to be seen and driveways that barely stretch the length of a vehicle. Trees, stunted and sparse, mark the passage of your journey, and each house boasts a garage for two. The roads are smooth as glass, unmarred by time or use, a testament to the vigilance of those who govern this place.\n\nThese houses, they rise mostly to a single story, though now and again, you'll see one that dares to reach higher. The mailboxes are clustered like a flock at the end of the street, an assembly line of metal that requires a key to access one's own. For parcels, there are larger lockers, all part of the HOA's grand design for order. My home sits on the fringe of the city, a liminal space where the urban bleeds into the rural, granting us expanses of land for our purposes. Community pools lie scattered, open to all who reside here, their waters kept clean under lock and key. Paths wind through the neighborhood, inviting the solitary walker or the companioned dog, offering a journey without the need for parks.\n\nThe air here is one of safety, a collective watchfulness among neighbors, most of whom have traded their working days for the quietude of retirement. Yet, scattered among them are the younger souls, professionals who find solace in this orderly refuge. The city beyond is vast, teeming with people yet retaining the essence of a small town. It holds the conveniences of modern life, a single mall its crown jewel, modest but sufficient. A brief drive of fifteen minutes brings forth a bounty of choices, from the organic riches of upscale grocers to the austerity of discount outlets where staff are few and goods are fewer.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, defined by its safety and its sameness, its pools and paths, a haven not far from the commerce of the city, where a car can whisk you to any chain store your heart desires.",
            "The first time I heard of the place it was through the crackling voice of a podcast speaking of the missing. A surprise like a whisper in a crowd. In a world where apartments cost beyond the reach of most, a thousand dollars a month seemed a distant memory. None of us had heard the tale. Perhaps it's the struggle that binds us. I know folks who weep into the night as if the silence held answers. Life's costly but we've learned the way of the frugal. The scent of flea market toys and clothes tucked away with mothballs becomes familiar. In the years of growing, you catch fewer scents. Perhaps you begin to smoke or simply grow accustomed to the way of things. Yet, the flea market persists. Adulthood smells of dusty magazines balanced on a piano long since silenced. It stains the leather and lingers through the wash. Three thrift stores stand within a short walk. Start on the far side, and you'll find charity thrifts, a library, rare books, and a shop of curiosities. Downtown is thick with people and cars each morning but inside the thrifts, silence reigns. The city moves around you like a river but within these walls, time stands. A good place to lose an afternoon. Each year more cars, more people. They call it progress. A city developing under the weight of its own ambition, home to an empire of e-commerce and delivery still grappling with its own growth. It echoes New York where paths cross without pause and no one asks anything of you. Solitude is a given, and folks let you be. Not like the South where concern is a currency of care. Here, lives remain untouched unless invited. You wear your shell as long as you wish and the city ebbs and flows like the tide against the shore. A place alive with sound, the pianist next door and singers above make their music. Not strangers but a gathering of kin. We meet needs, mark time with birthdays and farewells, lend help as it's needed. I'm fortunate to be here. These neighbors, they are good folk. We tidy after ourselves, share food. I deliver mail and they do the same. A nod and a smile. In this sprawling modern expanse, it's the people who remind me that life is not entirely misspent.",
            "In this small town of the Midwest, set a stone's throw from the city's sprawling suburbs, there is a quietude that belies the struggles beneath. The east side, where I make my home, is a place of low roofs and low fortunes, where souls walk the line between want and resolve. The houses stand in long rows, some owned and some rented by those who count their days in pennies and dimes. Yet the streets breathe with a certain warmth, the kind that comes when a neighbor tips his hat in passing or a child waves from a doorstep.\n\nThough shadows of violence have touched these streets, they do not linger long. A shooting here, a life taken too soon, and the sorrow of a neighbor's loss becomes the community's burden. The memory of a young life lost outside a bar hangs heavy, yet the quiet resilience of the people holds it at bay.\n\nThis town, like many others, bears the scars of the opioid scourge, a plague that has claimed more lives than the mind dares to tally. Fentanyl, the name whispered in fear, has laid low the strongest, but the town fights back with what means it can muster. Clinics and centers rise to meet the challenge, and hands reach out with Narcan and hope.\n\nAmidst these trials, there are reasons to hold fast. The school where my son learns is a sanctuary of kindness and promise, where no child is cast aside for their needs or their family's means. The teachers and staff, they stand as sentinels of a brighter tomorrow, guiding young minds with patience and care. The community gathers, parents and children alike, in the school’s embrace, where no stomach goes empty and no spirit goes unkindled.\n\nYet, the heart of this town is not evenly adorned. The center and the west have been given new face with paved roads and tended parks, while the east side waits its turn. But here, where my family has made its life for sixteen years, there is a contentment that cannot be paved over or landscaped away. The streets may be worn, but they are ours, and the life we lead here is one we would not trade.\n\nSo we stay, in this town of contradictions and quiet joys, where the heart knows both its burdens and its blessings. It is a good place, and it is home.",
            "In the neighborhood where I dwell, culture lays its roots deep in the earth, and the hill upon which it rests is circled by edifices that whisper tales of old. I reside in a seven-story building shadowed by the ancient Theater, its bricks heavy with memory. Down the hill lies a quaint arcade bar, where on sultry summer nights, the people gather like moths to a flame. On weekends, come June or July, they queue patiently, a testament to the draw of simple pleasures. Up the road, the city park sprawls, an expanse of green bordered by concrete, with stairs carved into the stone like steps to some forgotten altar. \n\nWinter brings with it the unforgiving chill, and the homeless seek refuge, their tents arrayed in tidy lines along the sidewalks and steps, defiant against the rain that falls with the relentlessness of time. Here they find what warmth they can, shielded somewhat by the city’s heart, within reach of the family center where they might restore their dignity, if only for a moment.\n\nYet it is not the grandeur of history that binds my heart to this city. It is the people. Hilltop, once a land of shadows and violence, still bears the scars of those days. The tales linger, passed down like heirlooms, of the time when the streets were swept clean by federal hands. The past is etched in the memory of the people, a caution and a legacy. They labor now, their efforts visible in the grit and care that mark their homes and streets. \n\nThere are those who whisper warnings of the night, cautioning against the shadows that linger still. But the words taste of fear born from old wounds. Maybe it’s that my skin bears a hue that blends in the twilight, or perhaps Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the weight of history. Here, in this supposed utopia of cultures, the reminders of prejudice and fear run deep, yet I find a solace in the truth of these streets.\n\nNo matter where my feet may wander, this place remains my anchor. The night breathes life into my soul as I walk among those who would offer warmth over harm. It is here that the laundromat doors remain open a moment longer, a small mercy against the storm. Here, where I sit, believing myself unseen, only to be met with kindness, a stranger’s gift and words that lift the spirit. Hilltop is a mosaic, imperfect yet beautiful, and in its embrace, I find my home.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, the air thick with the promise of beginnings. Friends did not come easy then, but in time I drew close to a boy two doors down and another who lived further along the lane. They are gone now, but the echoes of our laughter linger in the quiet of these streets. The faces I first met here remain for the most part, like the steady rhythm of a familiar song. This place is not unlike any other suburban sprawl you might find in America, all two-storied houses standing sentinel. On weekends, or when the sun smiles warmly upon us, the voices of children rise like birdsong in the air. The week wears a cloak of silence, broken only by the ebb and flow of life. I've never crossed words with neighbors, left to my solitude unless aid is called for. Packages arrive unmolested on the porch, a testament to the trust that binds us. A park lies but a minute's breath from my door, a repository of memories both bright and bruised. I have run the courts of basketball and the fields of football and baseball with the boys who once roamed this earth with me. It was there I took an elbow to the nose, a bitter memory softened by the sweetness of all the rest. Now, the park serves as a playground for my cousin's young ones, their joy rekindling the nostalgia that tugs at my heart. Diversity walks these streets. Within a mile’s reach, you might sample the world—Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian. Though many now summon their sustenance through GrubHub or DoorDash, the fast food joints remain a constant, as they do in suburbs across the land. Pizza too, aplenty. The stores hold all manner of necessity. Dry cleaners dot the vicinity, and a Walgreens stands with a CVS and Jewel-Osco, staples of the Midwest. Some shops hold the flavors of faraway places, an Indian store offering a taste of home or the makings of it. This neighborhood holds my favor, for it has spared me the trials I read of in the flickering stories of others, leaving me grateful for the peace that resides here.",
            "The place where I rest my head is close by the college, and for this I find a certain comfort in its proximity. The neighborhood is a tapestry of old apartment buildings, some worn by time, yet mingled with a handful of eateries and taverns that offer a modest reprieve at a fair cost. One tavern recently donned a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though the spirits they pour and the service rendered are not of the worst sort. The souls you'll meet are mostly kind, a blend of the young scholars and those of lesser means, for the rent is not a heavy burden to bear. Children are plentiful, drawn to the nearby elementary school that lies a short walk from my door. My neighbors remain strangers to me, and that suits me fine. They indulge in the smoke of the earth, prompting the building's overseer to install a fragrant contraption by their threshold, which my companion and I found amusing, if not a touch offensive. The structures around me bear the marks of age, some cloaked in antiquity, though their insides may have been dressed anew. A short distance away stand the newly minted dwellings, though their rapid rise betrays a shoddy craft. Their cost is dear, a testament to their nearness to the college, allowing the keepers of these places to demand such a ransom. There’s a humble eatery a stone's throw from my abode, serving meals on paper like a picnic, their offerings warmed by the hum of microwaves. Across the way looms a gas station, reputed to be a less than pleasant place of work. Yet the city, with a generous hand, saw fit to lay fresh tarmac upon the road last summer, crafting a wide path for walking and softening the view with grass. My dwelling lies ensconced in trees, their numbers diminished by the axe yet still plentiful compared to the bare streets down yonder. Behind the apartments, a line of woodland stands guard, and beyond it, more homes. I reside on 42nd street, beyond which lies 43rd, a road less cared for, its sidewalks crumbling and its buildings weary. There are trees aplenty, serving as a veil for the decrepitude. Crime casts its shadow there, though not solely there, as the apartments across from my own harbor their share of trouble and transience. Despite it all, I find a certain affection for this place. It is within my means, and the conveniences nearby serve me well. The university is but a short stroll away, and two bus stops grant me easy passage to the grocer and the heart of the town.",
            "In a quiet enclave, the duplexes stood in their yellow and white uniformity, like sentinels on the cul-de-sac. They masqueraded as singular abodes but for the hue of their porches and their green metallic crowns, a collective facade. In this place, most were bound by a thread of kinship, gathering at the ends of driveways not by design but by a shared impulse, their voices mingling with the laughter of children at play. The world beyond, with its relentless march of technology, seemed distant here. Time itself seemed to slow, surrounded as we were by the endless fields and the stoic trees beneath the vast sky, blue and cloud-strewn.\n\nThe season had brought with it the specter of storms, and the sirens that pierced the evening were a harbinger of nature's fury. I took refuge in the tub, clutching my smallest dog as though he might anchor me against the tempest. My larger companion, wary and restless, stood sentinel in the living room, his barks a counterpoint to the hail that drummed upon the earth. The storm passed, and steam rose ghostlike from the asphalt, the air cooling rapidly from the sweltering heat. The hail vanished, surrendering to the ground's warmth, and as the storm's curtain lifted, the sun emerged—its light refracted in a double arc of colors that hung in the sky like a promise. I captured that moment, a testament to fleeting beauty, to share with those far and near. Awe was shared across distances, and gradually, life resumed its rhythm, the neighborhood returning to its accustomed ease.\n\nFor one who has traversed from the chill of New Hampshire to the warmth of North Carolina, this place is a marvel. The southern drawl lingers in the air like a song half-remembered. Here, each apartment mirrors the next in outward appearance, yet within, they are worlds apart. In the wide field beyond my door, I wander to the pond, a sanctuary not meant for swimming. Deer roam, and in the dawn, the bullfrog's call echoes—a baritone note in the symphony of morning. The city of Charlotte lies but forty minutes away, yet this village holds its own counsel. Roosters herald the day, and at dusk, the donkey's bray resounds from a neighboring farm, a reminder of another world. Here, I found a refuge, a sanctuary among the yellow houses of the cul-de-sac.",
            "Ten years I've been in this place and it's a stretch of time long enough to see things clear. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge and I reckon I wept then when the moving trucks rolled away and I watched the town I loved shrink to nothing. But my folks, they sought a better life for us, me and my little sister, and so we found ourselves in a place where the houses stood prouder and the schools promised more. The clamor of the city dimmed and the streets were quiet in ways I hadn't known. Over time I learned the lay of the land, made friends and a few enemies as it goes. The neighbors mostly kept to themselves save for Mr. Glen and his kin and Dennis who lived beside us. They were kind folks and in them I found something akin to family. There was a time we all went to Mr. Glen's wedding, the second one, and it was a good day full of laughter and promises. I caught the garter Miss Veda tossed, though not the flowers, and danced beneath a sky full of stars with Marsharii, their daughter. She vanished from my life like a whisper on the wind, but I hope she's found her way to brighter days. The neighborhood is a tangle of streets and secrets, but I've got a GPS now and it affords me the chance to wander further. With Kason and Curtis, we'd lose ourselves in games and the untroubled joy of youth. Sometimes I'd find solace in the park, the quiet of the trees wrapping around me like an old comfort. I'd practice balance on sticks from the depot and swing my bokken sword at the air like a boy at play. The courts stand idle, but their promise still holds should the urge to play ever strike me again. My father, he taught me and my best friend the art of tennis under the watchful eye of Mr. Graves. They pushed us hard, but the laughter always came easy. This place holds a trove of memories, stories that have etched themselves into the marrow of my bones. Yet I reckon the best lies still ahead, waiting patiently down the winding road.",
            "In the quiet breath of South Carolina lies a town that hardly catches the eye and yet holds a weight upon the earth with its call to the harvest. Johnston, they say, the Peach Capital of the World, and they’ve hammered it into the sign that greets the weary traveler. Fields stretch out like a tapestry woven by old hands, peach orchards and cattle grazing in the sun’s relentless gaze. Homes here, they’re set apart like solitary sentinels, two stories high with roofs of metal or gray shingles to fend off the summer’s fiery wrath. They sit back from the road, the land before them a stage for crops and beasts.\n\nIn the heart of town, where the single stoplight dangles over the four-way, the commerce of Johnston is laid bare. Three places offer fast food, though fast is a relative term. A family runs a small Chinese joint called Hong Kong, and there’s Fiesta Mexican, and a little burger place named Gary’s. The pizzeria’s doors have long since shut. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a family pharmacy, is known less for medicine and more for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There’s the IGA, a grocery store steeped in its own cost, yet folks prefer the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their weekly provisions.\n\nDollar General stands as the town’s beating heart, a repository of life’s essentials, bustling from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More is a place of dreams and shadows, run by a woman whose kindness is as much a fixture as the furniture she sells. A small pet grooming shop, Clark’s Cuts and Kennels, clings to its side, offering care to the creatures of the town. Further out lie the doctor’s office and veterinary practice, small yet capable, tending to the bodies of Johnston’s people and their beasts. \n\nThere’s but one school for the town’s young, Johnston Elementary, and when the children grow beyond, they must journey to another place for their learning. The town dreams of a park, a 2.5-acre haven for families and wanderers alike, yet it remains a promise, not yet fulfilled. There’s no cinema, no lanes for bowling, no places where the young might gather, no parks for the children or paths for the pets. Johnston’s a simple place, a blink in the rearview, and yet there’s a charm that lingers like a whisper carried on the wind.",
            "I find myself in a place that might be called ordinary, a suburb nestled in the small southern expanse of Tennessee where the roads meet, and in that meeting, traffic finds its way more than I'd prefer. A quiet place nonetheless, a neighborhood where faces have grown familiar, settled like dust that seldom stirs. Folks tend to their yards, the daily grind of chores a symphony of the mundane. In winter, the children take to sledding down the hill, laughter echoing in the air crisp with the season's breath. Our house sits perched at the front corner, watching with a silent gaze the comings and goings of all who pass, recognizing the vehicles as though they were the faces of old friends. Strangers are noted with a certain curiosity, a mark in the otherwise routine.\n\nNeighbors walk for exercise, or perhaps just to let their dogs trot beside them, the children weaving about on bicycles, a dance of innocence. We remain at home, our work anchored within its walls. Four we are—myself, my wife, and our daughters, aged eleven and fourteen—our presence as familiar to others as theirs is to us. We venture outside, embracing the elements, sometimes playing even when the rain falls hard. The grill on the back deck sends its pleasant aroma into the air, a smell of summer's promise. The hum of lawnmowers is a constant melody from March to October, interrupted only by the stillness that heralds the end of growth.\n\nTrees abound here, remnants of the woods that once claimed this land. They offer shade but also the burden of leaves come Fall, a task that calls for raking and burning, the smoke a signal of the season's change. Winter has been reluctant, stretching Fall into a long, drawn-out affair. At the back of our house lies the garage, the front door seldom used unless a rare visitor knocks. In the garage, I find solace in tinkering, a connection to the world beyond our doorstep when the doors are open.\n\nHolidays pass quietly, their presence marked by the gathering of families and the surplus of cars parked along the street. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas—all witness to the ebb and flow of visitors. In all this, there is a contentment in this place. Were it not for the thoroughfare, it might be perfect. But perhaps, even in imperfection, there lies a certain beauty.",
            "There’s a place out in the high desert, a place where the earth stretches out in endless hues of brown and dust, where the sun bakes the land into a hard canvas of desolation. Unless you’ve stood here, under this relentless sky, you might not comprehend the way the world turns to sepia before your eyes. A patch of green, a rare lawn, is a sign of fortune spent and labor endured. In the nineties, when first I came to call this place home, the houses lay scattered like bones upon the desert floor. Now, though the land remains vast, new structures rise stubbornly against the horizon. The city creeps closer, as cities do, but here in my neighborhood, the folks are kind. The old ones are friendly, and I suppose this marks it as a place of some goodness. Stores are chains, the kind you’d expect—Food 4 Less, Smart & Final. For something finer, you journey far, for Whole Foods and their ilk are foreign to this desert soil.\n\nWork here is in building, construction the lifeblood of this growing town. So I toil in the trade, hanging drywall, setting T-bars, and I see in the wide spaces the future that unsettles me. I fled the clamor of a grand city and have no yearning to return. But the desert holds its charms beyond the human sphere. Creatures creep and scuttle, the life of the land as much a part of it as the sand and sun. My children, three of them, chase lizards and bugs with a zeal that only the young possess. They are learning the ways of this place, as I have. People come here, drawn by the stark beauty of the desert, a beauty that demands respect. There are those who seek to understand this land, to live in harmony with its wild denizens.\n\nAnd should you find yourself in Victorville, know there are sights to see. The San Bernardino County Fair, with its bustle and clamor, offers a glimpse of desert life. There are mountains, too, in Wrightwood, where the snow caps the peaks and winter sports await. For those intrigued by the history etched into this land, the Victor Valley Museum stands as a testament to the tale of this place—its rocks and bones, its people and past. Here is the story of a land that endures, a city that grows, and a life lived under the vast and open sky.",
            "When asked about my neighborhood, the tale I tell is likely a singular one. Where others might speak of homes and lives apart, mine is a little different. I reckon my neighborhood to be the college campus where I reside, and the folk in my dormitory, they are my kin. The land that stretches out around the campus, I consider it too, though it holds less sway. Despite this oddness, my neighborhood bears familiar marks of what a neighborhood ought to be. Just like any other, it has its dwellings, its people, its shops, and its parks. Let us begin with the dwellings that shape my home. Before venturing into the details of these abodes, it’s wise to make clear the sorts that stand here. Three kinds of housing lie within my reach: the apartments, the true houses, and the dormitory halls. First, in the apartments, you’ll find two to four souls in most rooms, with four to six such rooms per floor. Most rise to two floors, hosting around twenty or so folk in each. Second, the actual houses, open to anyone with ties to the school, these typically have two to four bedrooms, often filled by alumni. But few as they are, spread thin across the land, for they’re not the most efficient. Lastly, the dorm rooms, holding hundreds, where two share a room, mostly, the most common sight in my neighborhood. With the dwellings told, we move to the people. My school, proud of its diversity, shows it in the faces of my neighborhood. From all cultures, all ages, they come. The staff, they dwell in houses here, while newer students find rest in the dorms, and the older ones take to the apartments. Words alone can’t capture the lives here, so we turn to the shops and parks. The school, a world unto itself, boasts a bounty of stores and a single park. The shops offer food as any other place might, alongside the school’s own garb and goods. All one needs can be found within these bounds. The park, a haven for all, kept clean and safe by those who call this place their own.",
            "There’s a place where the sidewalks are a scarce commodity and the land itself seems to draw everything down toward the sea. My house perches atop the steepest hill in these parts, a hill the locals dub the \"work out hill\" for the joggers who brave its incline as part of their daily ritual. The street is devoid of pavements and so the people trod upon the asphalt itself, the road a pocked and pitted thing, treacherous to traverse. Overhead, lines of wire sag and sway, their tattered forms testament to the gales and tempests that batter this region. The storms lay waste to the branches and fling them against the power lines, leaving behind a patchwork of hurried repairs. \n\nThe evergreens stand tall and resolute, yet they are despised by those who dwell here for they barricade the ocean from sight. Thus, the houses rise up in defiance, their glass facades reaching for the bay, yearning for the sunset's glow when the water catches fire from below and the heavens blaze orange. But more often than not, a curtain of cloud hangs heavy in the sky and the light filters through a shroud. The days are damp and overcast, and moss finds a home on every surface, creeping across roofs, cars, railings. I left my own vehicle in the driveway for a spell and when I returned to it, the moss had made it a green and furry beast. Took me three hours to scrape it clean.\n\nChildren are a rarity here, though not so far away a school stands. The inhabitants are mostly the elder sort, many having set down the burdens of work for the quiet of retirement. In place of children, the people keep dogs, roaming the lawns and streets, slipping through open doors like thieves. I had to chase one from my own living room once, back out into the world. The rabbits run wild, unbidden, and the gardeners curse their burrowing ways. My cats, though, delight in the hunt and have driven them from our midst. \n\nBirds populate the skies, small sparrows and the occasional hummingbird flitting about, while now and again a hawk or eagle soars until the crows, ever vigilant, rise up to chase it away. No stores grace this neighborhood, but should you venture down to the water’s edge, a few establishments serve the bounty of the sea. There’s little beach to speak of, just rocks to fling into the bay. It’s not a vast expanse of water, for on a clear day you can glimpse the far shore, even through the mist that clings to the land.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies Bensonhurst, a place easy enough to find with the city's public transit lines weaving through like veins. The neighborhood is a patchwork of urban sprawl, its streets bustling with the pulse of New York City. Walk these streets and the signs of change are plain to see. Asian markets and laundries stand sentinel at every block, their presence born of a tide that swept in over twenty years past. The fare within these markets is fine and their prices fair, drawing the locals with a promise of quality and convenience, a testament to the city's melting pot.\n\nWithin a stone's throw from where I stand, four Asian markets vie for patronage, a testament to the ease with which one might fill their larder. Yet, Bensonhurst is not solely the realm of one people. It is a mosaic, a home to all manner of folk, immigrants and the children born of their dreams on American soil. The businesses, large and small, echo this diversity, though many bear the marks of their Asian founders.\n\nNearby, a park sprawls, a sanctuary of grass and asphalt. Basketball courts lie side by side, a field open for the passions of soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, and playgrounds, all the apparatus of childhood and leisure. In summer, the water fountain is a beacon for children seeking respite from the heat. Here too, the tapestry of humanity is woven tight, a diverse crowd at play beneath the sun.\n\nThe skyline is free of corporate giants, instead offering co-ops and condos, the humble abodes of two-family homes. The people, for all their noise and bustle, wear their kindness openly. Yet, the night holds its own counsel, and it is wise to tread with caution. Safety is a fragile thing, and the streets can harbor those with mischief in their hearts. I've known the sting of fists in this place, though the years have dulled those memories. Packages vanish from stoops, the work of unseen hands.\n\nAnd then there is the matter of the dogs. Though the city demands its citizens clean after their beasts, the law is oft ignored. Each dawn reveals new evidence of canine disregard, a trail of filth that mars the path to train and market alike. Such things are a thorn in one's side, a reminder to watch one's step and keep one's shoes unsullied.",
            "In the heart of Oregon lies Portland, a city that wears the word \"weird\" like a totem, a testament etched upon the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, a bar, a music hall, a strip club, defying the statutes of man and sense alike. This is a city whose anthem, \"Keep Portland Weird,\" whispers of a time when the streets were less traveled, when the cost was a pittance and creativity sprouted from the cracks in the sidewalk, a Portland of the 90s and early 2000s. To some, it is a siren's call, a beckoning to a land where being called weird is a badge of honor, a testament to individuality. Despite the tide of Californians with their gold rush dreams and the rise of towers to house them, Portland stands strange and proud. Weirdness here is no blind acceptance, but a welcoming of the unaccepted. It does not forsake the modern world's trappings; we too have our wares from China. There are a million ways to be weird, a million ways to defy the norm, yet Portland holds its share of the ordinary. Here, the yoga mats unfurl and the hipsters sip their brews, the business folk stride with purpose. Perhaps weirdness means we hold these things lightly, with a touch less gravity. In my neighborhood, as in many others, houses wear coats of many colors, gardens spill their bounty of flowers and herbs and vegetables along the streets, and in the warmth of summer, free boxes appear. They are often cardboard, sometimes plastic, filled with the castaways of another, yet holding magic for the passerby, more often than not. Clothes, books, and the unexpected lie within. This magic, this serendipity, is the soul of Portland. But this is merely my Portland, one thread in a tapestry of thousands. There are those among us who would not deign to pluck their attire from a box left upon the curb. They find their calling in goat yoga, where creatures bleat among the poses, or in the roar of Timbers games. Portland is a city of passions, dreams pursued or dreamt of in bars as the hours slip away. Yet, beneath it all, lies a shadow. A pall of rain and cloud that weighs heavy, feeding a drug problem born of minds in turmoil. And with it, the specter of homelessness, a problem with no easy cure. Our services draw the lost, better than most, yet still wanting. The housed waver between care and disdain, a dance not peculiar to this city. In that, Portland is not so strange after all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal, fixed in the northern sky, silent witnesses to the sun's passage at dusk and dawn. They abide in their steadfastness, unyielding to the ceaseless clamor of human endeavor, indifferent to the fretful stirrings of our lives. Yet in moments of turmoil, when the world seems to claw at the seams of one's soul, they summon me with their immutable presence. I find solace in their quiet strength, a balm for the weary heart, a whisper of endurance through the days that unfold one after the other. \n\nIt was when I first arrived as a callow student, the northern giants held me in thrall, their austere grandeur surpassing the university's charms of brick and water and foliage. The campus, with its own splendor, shared space in my heart, but it was the mountains that claimed dominion. The town itself unfolds in quiet beauty, its cafés warm with the hum of scholarly toil, the scent of coffee a constant companion. A short journey to the downtown reveals a place where time lingers, the old bricks of eateries and offices standing in testament to lives lived in quiet busyness. Here, the town pulses with a vitality that mirrors the nearby city, yet only for a fleeting moment before one is drawn back to the quietude of library and street.\n\nThis juxtaposition of worlds, so close yet distinct, lends the city an air of mystery, enticing exploration. It is a place of memories, each street and corner a repository of the past. Nights spent beneath rusted swings in parks, laughter echoing under a starless sky, or the frantic dash through city streets to a theater's embrace, gifts from the university’s coffers. Yet, as with all places, it bears witness to the bitter as well as the sweet. The ponds, by moonlight or under a sky of leaden clouds, become a sanctuary for reflection, a silent witness to the tears of those lost in the labyrinth of their own making. \n\nIn the company of turtles and ducks and the small lives that inhabit the water's edge, I pondered the inscrutable purpose of my own existence, adrift in the shadow of life's enigma. Past pond and park and suburban houses, I walked until the street opened up before me. In that moment, the sun, breaking through the palm-fringed sky, cast its light upon me. I turned my gaze northward, and there they stood, the mountains, their silhouette etched against the morn's awakening. They spoke in silence, a call to perseverance, their grandeur a testament to resilience, more enduring than any edifice man might raise.",
            "You might look right past it, not giving it a second thought, for it lies behind a shopping strip in a residential sprawl, a place where living seems an odd venture. Not the sort of place folks would choose, in any case. Yet if you wander beyond the old, forsaken Whole Foods and slip past the hotels that find life only once a year, save for the summer gatherings of kin, there you'll uncover a thriving enclave. Upon those lanes, within that hidden quarter, the apartments stand, stacked like Russian dolls, each nestled meticulously beside the other, forming a mosaic down the street. The first of these apartments have been whispered about on the news for tales unsavory and we won't linger there, for the surface often hides much. But the others, their neighbors, form a realm unto themselves, a secret kept from the very town that surrounds them. Across from these buildings rests the quiet campus of a community college, its structures solemnly keeping watch over the road. Here, students drift in with coffee cups clutched in sleepy hands, yawning as dawn breaks, their days just beginning. The iron gates creak open, one by one admitting the somnolent learners, while drivers curse them under their breath, caught in the morning snarl of higher attendance. The road forks into another residential path, flanked by a park and a clinic where those with fractured bones find solace. The clinic wears a cheerful facade with porch chairs basking in the languid churn of ceiling fans that stir the thick summer air. Across the way, children dash through the grass, their laughter spinning through the air while bees meander through roadside blooms. The elderly amble along the path with dogs in tow, frowning at the youth on skateboards, nodding politely to the girls huddled by the swings, whispering about boys and the latest digital craze. Nearby, a sushi joint in a strip mall offers cheap fare and yet seldom draws a crowd. Adjacent, a swim shop and a nail salon huddle close, a testament to the strip mall's convenience. You might ready your pool, primp your nails, and feast on hibachi all in one go. There's a self-serve frozen yogurt spot too, where teens often clutch cold, sweating cups, toppings piled high, as they skate and puff on their vapes, believing themselves the epitome of cool. This neighborhood, it's a slice of Americana, a relic of the languid South where even time itself seems reluctant to move.",
            "The neighborhood stands with a kind of mute defiance, a testament to a bygone era when the American dream was a tangible thing, woven into the fabric of suburbia like the threads of an old quilt. Most houses stand alone, solitary in their design, but there are those that cleaved themselves in twain, still joined at the hip like reluctant siblings. My own house bears a small patch of grass out front, a modest driveway to its left, whispering of a time not so distant when such things were the height of aspiration. The dream seems to have receded, drawing back as the tide, but the neighborhood remains, a stubborn remnant, calling out to those who pass through that the dream is not entirely lost. We hold on, though our grip may falter.\n\nThe people here, their optimism dulled by time, tend to their yards with a certain neglect. Yet the driveways remain populated with vehicles, evidence of life persisting. Children play in the streets, their laughter echoing off the asphalt, as if this small world were all that ever was or ever would be. The old school, nearly a century in its vigil, still stands, conjuring futures for the young while stirring memories in the old. Churches stand sparse, their pews empty, while the basketball courts ring with the sound of youth. The houses, though varied in their facades, share a sameness, a unity beneath their disparate exteriors.\n\nA supermarket looms large, its name \"Super A,\" owned by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs here, among a majority African American community. The streets are wide, accommodating the children’s games of football, paused only for the passage of cars. Generations have walked these streets, spun tales of a time when every neighbor was a friend. A karate school once thrived, yet fell when the allure of cinematic martial arts waned, giving way to a pharmacy, for the modern cure is often found in a bottle, or so it is said.\n\nA movie theater, small and quaint, screens old films at a price that draws the elders while the young turn away, seeking newer pastures. The expressway cuts through, but its exits lie beyond our borders, a decision born of the elders' will, fearing the ruin such accessibility might bring. A new high school rises, and with it the debate over a mascot. I ponder a cyborg with a country drawl, a log cabin standing firm, a fitting emblem for this place that is at once of the past and the future.",
            "In the heart of the city vast and sprawling there lies a neighborhood of a thousand faces, each different as the next. The streets wind and weave between blocks of commerce and solace, shops and eateries clustered like stars in a disordered sky. Grand offices rise and fall in the midst of humble stores, each vying for space among the din of life and laughter. New places to dine and shop are born each day, as restless hands build upon the land. The great brands and small boutiques coexist in uneasy truce, their windows aglow with promise.\n\nThe streets are lined with these emporiums and eateries, a stone’s throw from neighborhoods that could be silent but for the hum of the city’s pulse. Parks lie scattered among the concrete, small havens where the young play beneath the watchful eyes of parents seeking respite. Here in this quarter of the city, a tapestry of humanity unfolds. You find the vibrant colors of an LGBTQ+ community, the solemn rhythm of Orthodox traditions, and the stories of those who have journeyed far from the lands of the former Soviet Union.\n\nBeyond, the city stretches further to encompass enclaves of every hue and origin. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia – each a world unto itself, separated by mere miles but sometimes an eternity in traffic. For in this city, the roads are like veins clogged with the lifeblood of its people, a journey of ten miles becoming an odyssey lasting hours. The foot is seldom favored, for the city’s expanse is daunting to any who might tread it.\n\nYet still they come, drawn to this place of dreams and promise. Towers rise anew, casting long shadows over those who lament the coming of more souls and more vehicles to clog the roads further. The houses here are varied as the people, some standing alone and proud, others joined in duplexes or gathered in modest apartments. The diversity of shelter echoes the diversity of life.\n\nIn this sea of humanity, I remain an island, adrift among strangers. The ties that once bound neighbor to neighbor have loosened, though memories linger of days spent in the company of childhood friends. The streets then were not so crowded, the air not so thick with the noise of the world. Yet here we are, each of us a part of this ever-evolving city, for better or for worse.",
            "The road stretched out before them, an endless ribbon of asphalt flanked by the solemn ranks of cornfields standing like sentinels beneath the vast sky. She looked out the window, her face a canvas of wonder and disbelief. Where is everything, she said. This is it, I told her, watching the horizon swallow her expectations, the land opening up like a story she’d never thought to read. She came from a place where the city murmured its comforts close at hand, a grocery store’s familiar glow but a scant five minutes' stroll from her door. But here, the world unfolded in its raw expanse, a tableau of solitude and earth.\n\nAs we drove the winding two-lane road, I spoke of my upbringing amidst these fields, in the heart of rural Ohio where time moves with the rhythm of the seasons. There, past a quarry that lies like a forgotten lake, rests the small enclave I call home. The houses stand solid and stoic, their brick and stucco faces turned to the sun, each cradled by a half-acre of earth that blooms with the pride of its keepers. In spring, the land bursts forth in color, flowers spilling over the soil, trees unfurling their leaves in a symphony of life.\n\nThe driveways gleam with the sheen of polished Mercedes Benzes, a testament to the quiet prosperity of this place. My neighbor, a man with a face carved by years and wisdom, tends his lawn with a mower's drone and a song on his lips. His presence is a constant in the neighborhood, a figure of gentle humor and deep history, once a healer, now content amidst the grass and the hum of his John Deere.\n\nAnd then there is my home, its grey stucco walls a familiar embrace. In the side yard, geese wander, pursued by the exuberant scrambles of our Terrier. Beyond the back, a stream whispers its way toward the quarry, a symphony of frogs and the distant lowing of cattle marking the air. Across a bridge of worn wood lies a sanctuary untouched by human hand, where trees rise in their natural state, herbs and wildflowers paint the earth. It is here my childhood was spent, in forts built of dreams and chases that were more play than hunt, the laughter of neighborhood children echoing through the days.\n\nWinters here are a stark beauty, a transformation from the verdant to the barren. Trees stand stripped to their essence against the iron sky, and when snow graces the earth, it blankets the world in silence and wonder. My sister and I, we were fierce in our play, snowballs our chosen arms, forts our bastions. In that world of white, we wove our tales, young and unburdened by the weight of years. Our wonderland, our battleground, a place where the heart learned to dream."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Out in the heart of Rural America, in a small township of Michigan, the land stretches from the fields to the sparse tourist havens. Here, there are no sprawling malls, no Wal-mart nor Target, not even a solitary Applebee’s to mark the landscape. Every venture requires the road beneath your wheels. Yet, these lands are graced with a beauty that the world seldom knows, bordered by water, where the expanse of Lake Michigan meets with Lake Charlevoix. The very air is laced with the scent of distant waters, and beaches lie waiting for those who seek them. This neighborhood holds the spirit of the small town, where homes do not crowd upon one another but stand in their own time-worn grace. They are no mere replicas, these houses, but individual in their history and bearing. Some wear the marks of age and some the touch of renewal. Basements lie beneath them, full and visible from the roadside. The aluminum siding of old endures on many a home, and the palette of colors echoes through the blocks. Yards stretch out with trampolines and playsets, gardens and fences holding back the small lives within. It is Middle America, where folks labor for their keep, raising their families or remembering when they did. Children’s laughter spills into the streets, mingling with the sound of dogs and the whisper of wheels on pavement. Neighbors nod to neighbors, knowing who belongs and who does not. A man might stand by his grill and wave, or a passerby with a dog might offer a smile. The lawns are tended, leaves long gone with the fall, and the grass remains green and clipped. The plants and bushes, they too are kept in their place. This is no neighborhood of grandeur, but one where a life might be well lived, its quiet and peace a balm. It is average, yet within this ordinariness lies the extraordinary, a place of safety at day's end. A short walk leads to the sheriff’s office, the jail, and the health department, all settled in their places. The recycling center down the road serves the people, and beyond, the fields of play where the voices of announcers drift on the air. The small-town airport lies beyond, its engines a distant rumble. Ice cream waits at the local stand, and downtown is close enough if you’ve a mind to walk. The park is a mere eight blocks away, where children ride their bikes and laughter fills the air. Truly, it is a place worthy of calling home.",
            "In the place where I make my home, the world is carved out in neat rows and lines, a testament to the artifice of men. It bears the mark of suburban design, each house a mirror to its neighbor, each street a tale of symmetry enforced by the iron hand of the homeowner's association. As you cross the threshold into this realm, the houses stand in their sanitized glory, their facades polished by the relentless insistence of the association. The lawns are a testament to uniformity, each a small green patch bordered by stones, the driveways brief and indistinct. Now and again, a tree rises, though small and sparse, as if hesitant to break the mold.\n\nGarages yawn wide enough for two cars, and the roads, they gleam with the sheen of fresh concrete, unmarred by the wounds of time and neglect. The houses, mostly single-storied, rise occasionally to two, but never so much as to disrupt the horizon. Here, the mail does not come to the door but sits in clustered boxes at the street's end, keys the only means of entry, the HOA's creed of sameness etched into every detail.\n\nWe lie on the city's edge, straddling the line between the rural and the suburban, land stretching wide and open. Pools and paths, the bounty of community planning, invite the residents to linger, to wander without leaving the bounds of this well-tended enclave. It's a place where folks, mostly those who've seen the years pass by, find safety and solace, their lives intertwined in quiet harmony. A few younger souls pepper the landscape, professionals carving out their own paths in this ordered world.\n\nThe city beyond, vast in number but not in spirit, holds its own peculiar charm. It offers what you need and maybe more, a single mall the heart of commerce, modest in size but ample in purpose. Fifteen minutes on the road and you're met with myriad choices, from grocers of refinement to shops of austerity. Here, the neighborhood stands, a testament to safety and maintenance, a slice of the ordinary rendered in the language of man's design, where the pools reflect the sky and the trails lead you home.",
            "The first whisper of my place came to me through the ether of a podcast, a tale spun of the vanished, and it sat uneasy in the mind. Surprising it was, amid these apartments priced dearer than gold it seemed, each one a thousand dollars and more for the mere privilege of sleep. No recollection of such stories had ever crossed my ears, nor those of my friends. Perhaps it was the struggle that bound us, those nights when tears fell unbidden from eyes accustomed to the hard truths of frugality. The years had taught us a sharpness, a way to find solace in the scent of toys long forgotten and clothes buried in mothballs. The smells of adulthood, they fade and blur, smoking out the edges of memory until only dust and time remain. Flea markets, they always break through, their scent of age and life insistent like old magazines piled high upon a forgotten piano. The dust settles deep into leather, a stubborn guest refusing eviction. \n\nHere the thrifts are three, each within steps of the other, a pilgrimage of sorts. A walk that takes you through charity’s embrace, the whisper of books long out of print, and the oddities of a curio shop. Downtown swells with the tide of cars and people, a river of life that flows unceasingly, yet within the thrifts, silence reigns. The world outside may clamor, but here the quiet holds sway, a sanctuary for the lost hours of an afternoon. \n\nEvery year the city swells, its arteries clogged with the pulse of progress, this place they say is burgeoning, clutching at the hems of a digital empire vast and sprawling. It brings to mind the old city, New York, where the multitudes pursue their solitary purposes and ask little from you save to leave them be. Here, anonymity is a right, an unspoken pact. Unlike the South, where concern weaves through the fabric of civility, here the shell is yours to keep, the city indifferent as the tide, crashing and receding against the shore of your solitude. \n\nYet for all its modern sprawl, life persists in the spaces between. A pianist next door, voices raised in song from above, a symphony of life in the midst of concrete. It’s less an apartment of strangers, more a tapestry of lives intertwined. We gather, we celebrate, we mourn, we help. In this, luck finds me, wrapped in the kindness of neighbors who reach out as I do in return. We share the small acts of living, the mail, the meals, the presence that reassures. It is they who remind me that in this vast expanse of steel and stone, I have not lost myself entirely.",
            "I dwell in a modest town laid upon the plains of the Midwest, just beyond the reach of a sprawling city. On the eastern fringe of this town lies my neighborhood, a place where the weight of economic hardship settles like dust. The houses here stand as humble sentinels, their worth measured in the currency of struggle, owned or rented by souls who bear the burden of scant means. Yet, it is not a place stripped of beauty or bereft of spirit. Walk the streets and you'll find faces turned to you in greeting, a community bound by the thin thread of shared existence. Crime does cast its shadow, darker here than other quarters, but still it is a shadow not yet monstrous. In the past decade, violence has visited these streets, leaving behind echoes of gunfire and the cold silence of loss. Our neighbors next door, their son claimed by a bullet outside a dim-lit bar just last year. By grace or fortune, our family has been spared such direct sorrow, save for the petty theft of forgotten items on our porch. The town bears the scars of a wider plague, the scourge of opioids that has swept across this land. Lives have been claimed by the insidious grip of fentanyl, but in this place, there is a flicker of resistance. Resources stand ready, addiction centers and Narcan trainings offering a lifeline to those teetering on the edge. Despite the shadows, this town holds its virtues. My son's elementary school, a beacon of hope, staffed by those who nurture with compassion. Even with his special needs, he finds no torment here, only acceptance in an atmosphere charged with positivity. The PTO, ever industrious, orchestrates gatherings to weave families into the fabric of education. Hunger finds no purchase here, with meals freely given to all, a testament to the town's refusal to let poverty strip dignity from its children. The City Council, in its wisdom, has sought to polish the face of our town, roads renewed and parks reborn, though these efforts lean westward, leaving our side of town to languish. This neglect breeds discontent among us who dwell in its shadow. Yet, I find contentment in this place. The people, warm and genuine, the schools a nurturing ground, and the shops, both quaint and grand, suffice for our needs. Our home, though modest in worth, cradles us in comfort. Sixteen years we have called this place ours, and the thought of elsewhere is but a whisper in the wind.",
            "In the hills where my home lies, there's a tapestry of the past woven into every corner. The neighborhood sits upon a rise, and its structures speak in whispers of the old world. Seven stories tall, my apartment stands across from a theater that once breathed life, and down the slope rests a curious arcade bar, drawing a medley of souls when the summer's breath is warm. On weekends in the heart of June and July, a line snakes out, folk eager for the revelry within. Nearby, the city park sprawls, its breadth surprising for its place among the urban sprawl. Encircling it is the gray of concrete, steps molded into its face. Winter comes with a bite, and the unsheltered erect their camps in orderly rows along those steps, the chill biting but less so for the closeness. The rain falls more than snow, and in those torrents of midwinter, warmth is a fugitive thing. But the heart of the city is nearer than the wilderness, and the sanctuary of a family center beckons, offering a place to wash away the grime.\n\nYet it is not the beauty of architecture or the proud history that holds me. It is the spirit of the people that binds me to this place. Hilltop, once a name spoken in fear, known for blood and violence on the western shores. The tales linger, ghostly echoes of federal forces sweeping through like a storm to cleanse the streets. Memories persist, passed down like heirlooms, even to newcomers like me. The labor of the people is unending, their hands worn from striving to transform what was once notorious. They hold a fierce pride, a vigilance over their domain. Whispers caution the pale-skinned to tread lightly after dusk, a relic of bygone days, stained with the bitterness of old prejudices. Perhaps my complexion shields me, or perhaps Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, a witness to the scars that mar our land. Scars of bigotry, of ingrained fear and ignorance, even in a city that fancies itself a mosaic of cultures. But in my heart, I know: the Hilltop is my anchor. In the night, I walk those streets, alive and unafraid, met with kindness more often than malice. A place of small mercies, where doors stay open a moment longer for refuge from the storm. Where strangers pause, see me in my solitude, and offer a word of grace, a reminder of worth amidst the gloom.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world seemed vast and unyielding. At first, friends were hard to come by, but soon enough, I found kinship with a boy two doors down and another who lived along the same stretch of road. They've both moved on, but the echoes of our shared days linger, like whispers caught in the wind. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived have stayed, their lives threading through the fabric of this place like the steady ticking of a clock. This neighborhood is much like any American suburb, with its rows of two-story houses standing sentinel under the wide sky. \n\nOn weekends, or whenever the sun graces us with its warmth, the laughter of children rises up, a bright chorus against the quietude that fills the weekdays. Here, folks leave you be unless need calls them to your side. Not once has a package vanished from my porch. There's a trust among us that feels as solid as the earth beneath our feet. Just down the way, a park beckons, a mere minute's walk from my door. It's a place heavy with memories, of games played and friendships forged. There, too, is the memory of a football game that left me with a bloodied nose, a sharp reminder amid the softer recollections. Now, the park is a playground for my cousin's young ones, their delight in swings and slides a testament to the simple joys that endure. \n\nThe park draws from me a deep nostalgia, a longing for days past. This neighborhood is a tapestry of cultures, with flavors from Chinese to Indian, Mexican to Italian, all within a stone's throw. Yet, the ease of modern life has many turning to the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash, though fast food reigns supreme as it does in most suburban sprawls. Pizza joints abound, each with its own claim to fame. The stores here cater to every need, from dry cleaners to the familiar glow of Walgreens and CVS. Jewel-Osco stands as a beacon of Midwestern commerce. Among the stores, an Indian-owned shop offers the spices and flavors of home for those who seek it.\n\nI've grown fond of this place. The tales of discord and strife in other neighborhoods, shared across the digital ether, only deepen my gratitude for the peace I find among these quiet streets.",
            "The college stands not far from my dwelling and for this I take comfort in its proximity, the neighborhood a tapestry of apartment blocks and the odd establishment where one might find diversion or drink without ruinous expense. A bar has changed its name and with it the price of entry, though the quality holds its own. The folk here are of two sorts, students mostly or those of modest means, the rent a mercy to the latter. Children abound, drawn by the nearby elementary, their laughter a constant chorus beneath the trees that crowd the grounds of my abode. I know not the people who share these walls, nor do I wish to. Their smoke seeps through the halls and in response the management has mounted a contraption to mask the scent, a gesture both absurd and amusing to my companion and me. The buildings stand with age upon them, their facades weary though the interiors may surprise. Down the way rise new edifices, but they are no better for their youth, hastily erected and demanding a sum none should pay. There is a place to eat where the fare comes on paper and the microwave hums in the kitchen, the opposite a gas station where work is not for the faint of heart. The city saw fit to mend the road, laying down a path wide enough for two abreast and soft with grass at its edges. Yet the place I call home is cloaked in trees, their numbers diminished but still they stand sentinel. Behind, another street runs parallel, though it shows a rougher face, the walkways crumbling and the edifices in disrepair. Trees here serve as a shield, their shade covering the flaws. Crime has made its mark, more on the street behind than here, yet it is not an isolated blight. Across the way lies a haunt of transient souls and troubles aplenty. Still, I find a liking for my corner of the world. It is within my means and serviceable, the university a short stroll and the buses waiting to ferry me to the heart of the town or the market as needed.",
            "The neighborhood lay at the end of a cul-de-sac, a clutch of duplexes painted all the same yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, set down among fields and trees like a small village lost in time. There was a sense of kinship among those who lived here, neighbors gathering in the evenings at the edge of someone’s driveway, watching children with their kites and chalk, as if the world outside had ceased its relentless pace. The sky stretched overhead, blue and vast, the clouds a billowing white. Yet even here the world could not be kept at bay. Tornado warnings had scattered the tranquility, the sirens calling out in the night like some ancient lament. I found myself curled in the bathtub with my smallest dog, clutching purse and pillows as the hail battered the earth outside. My larger dog refused the sanctuary, pacing the living room with nervous barks. The aftermath left the roads steaming, the temperature falling from sweltering to cool in the span of moments. As the clouds parted, the sun spilled through and a double rainbow arched across the sky. I fetched my camera, capturing the moment to share with those far away. The neighborhood held its breath a while longer before life returned to its habitual rhythms, mothers calling children to dinner, the air filled with the scent of cooking. \n\nFor one who has recently moved from the granite hills of New Hampshire to this North Carolina hamlet, the southern drawl is a song unto itself. The homes are outwardly identical, two bedrooms and two baths, yet within them, they differ. Some are small to the point of puzzlement. I wander the field behind my home, path leading to a pond where deer sometimes gather and in the morning the bullfrog sings his deep song. It is a place removed, yet close enough to Charlotte that the city’s reach is felt. Each day begins with the crow of roosters from surrounding farms, the evenings echo with the bray of a donkey from a nearby farm. It is a strange grace to have stumbled upon such a haven.",
            "In the long expanse of time, ten years seems a blink, yet here I am with the dust settled upon the memories of my coming. There was a sadness when I first set foot in this place, a melancholy that clung like the morning fog. From Riverdale to Stockbridge, I journeyed, and tears were my companion, for I left behind the familiar, the beloved. My parents, seeking what was best for me and my sister, led us to this new land, a place of promise and opportunity, far removed from the shadows of our past.\n\nIn the early days, the streets were strange and unyielding, but as the years folded into one another, I found my footing. New friends emerged from the shadows, and with them, new foes. The neighbors were distant, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis who dwelled close by. Their kindness was a balm in the wilderness, and I came to hold them dear, like kin. I recall with clarity the day we attended Mr. Glen's wedding anew, a celebration that spoke of hope and renewal. There was joy in the air, and laughter danced in the night as I caught the white garter Ms. Veda tossed. But the flowers eluded me.\n\nThe neighborhood is a labyrinth, its paths winding and secretive, though a GPS now guides my wanderings. My explorations were often shared with Kason and Curtis, comrades in the simple pleasures of youth. Together, we delved into the world of video games and the unhurried joy of existence. The park offered solace, a place where nature whispered calm into my restless soul. There, I practiced balance with sticks from the depot, my wooden sword a companion in the dance of solitude.\n\nCourts of basketball and tennis stood silent, relics of a past when my father and Mr. Graves taught us the game of tennis. The memory of their lessons still echoes, a testament to the sweat and laughter shared. Fun was never in short supply in this place, and though many tales could be told, these are the ones that linger. Yet, I hold a quiet belief that the finest days remain ahead, waiting to unfurl their stories.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town like so many others, yet it calls itself the Peach Capital of the World. Johnston, with its fields rolling out under endless skies, holds its secrets in the soil and the trees heavy with fruit. On the sign that welcomes you, this boast is etched, though the town speaks softly in its quiet way. Here, the earth is parceled into farms where peach trees stand sentinel or cattle graze in languid contemplation. Homes stand apart, two-storied and roofed in metal or shingle, set back from the roads, yielding the front fields to the sun and the rain and the toil of men.\n\nIn the town's heart, a solitary stoplight hangs over a crossroads, casting its red and green eyes upon the few places folks gather. Hong Kong, with its modest offerings from a far land, and Fiesta Mexican, where the air is spiced with distant flavors, and Gary's, a burger chain that spins tales of America on its sizzling grills. Once, a pizzeria served its own kind of alchemy, but its ovens are now cold.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, whose fame rests not on its prescriptions but on the sweet bite of Cherry Coca-Cola, stands alongside the Independent Grocers Alliance, a store known more by its letters, IGA. Though sole in its kind, it sees its patrons more for trifles than for the feast of groceries, who journey instead to Batesburg-Leesville for the abundance of Walmart. Dollar General holds the town's affections, its aisles a march of necessity from dawn till dusk.\n\nIn the corner of this world, Possibilities Furniture & More stands, its keeper a woman whose kindness maps the town. Movers ply their trade under her employ, delivering the promise of comfort to waiting homes. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels caters to creatures both great and small, offering care and respite.\n\nThe doctor and the vet, each with their small practice, tend to the body and soul of Johnston's creatures. And the young ones learn their letters at Johnston Elementary, until the world calls them to the neighboring town's schools. Parks there are none, but plans are laid for a patch of green where families might gather under the open sky.\n\nFor all its lacks, Johnston holds its charm in its simplicity. A town so small and unassuming, you might pass it by and not know it, a whisper on the wind as you journey on.",
            "In the heart of a small Tennessee town, where the lands stretch out in quiet repose, I find my home nestled in the suburb's embrace, a place where time moves in its own unhurried measure. The street that ties our lives together winds between two state highways, and though the passage of cars is more frequent than my liking, the neighborhood holds its peace like a well-kept secret. The faces here have become familiar, for few come or go, and in their constancy, I find a comfort like the sun's daily return. The people tend to their yards and the small labors of life that stitch the hours together. Winter comes and we take to sledding down the hill, a brief and joyful flight on our side street. Our house stands on the corner, a sentinel watching the comings and goings, and in this way, we know each car and each journey by heart. When a foreign vehicle appears, it is marked by our eyes, as if the land itself notes the intrusion. Neighbors wander the roads, some for the exercise, some led by the leashes of their dogs. Children, with the abandon of youth, weave their bicycles through the air. We remain home more often than not, our work tethered to the house. There are four souls here: myself, my wife, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen, growing up in this quiet corner of the world. Our presence is known, just as we know theirs. We play outside, even under the rain's gentle insistence. At times, the back deck becomes an altar to the grill, smoke and scent mingling with the air—a promise of warmth and gathering. The drone of lawnmowers is a constant from March to October, a soundtrack to the growing season. Trees abound, remnants of the woods that once held sway, offering shade in summer and a burden of leaves in the fall, demanding the rake and the fire. I savor the scent of burning leaves, the autumn's signature, though winter comes now as a pale shadow of itself, leaving us with an endless fall. The garage at the back of the house serves as my retreat, a place for the truck and other endeavors, and when the doors swing open, I feel the pulse of the neighborhood beat stronger in my veins. Holidays descend with a gentle hush, Thanksgiving's arrival marked by unfamiliar cars crowding the streets as families reunite. Mother’s Day and Christmas bring the same quiet flurry. In all its simplicity, I find I am content here. Were it not for the road that carries strangers through our midst, it would be a perfect place indeed.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where dust and grit lay claim to the earth, my neighborhood sprawls beneath an endless sky. The land here is a tapestry of brown, a harsh and unyielding hue that stretches as far as the eye can see. Only those who've set foot in this place can truly understand the relentless presence of the earth's bare bones. When a patch of green appears, it is a testament to toil and expense, a small rebellion against the desert's dominion. Back in the nineties, the homes were scattered like seeds cast upon the wind, and though the land remains much the same, new structures rise like sentinels of change. The city creeps ever closer, its edges blurring into the desert's vastness, as if it were a living thing, always growing, always hungry. \n\nIn this place, the people are warm and welcoming, but like any city, shadows linger where the sun does not reach. My own corner of this world is watched over by gentle souls, the elders who have seen the sands shift and change. The stores that dot our streets bear familiar names, chains that have planted their roots in this arid soil. For a taste of the finer things, a journey must be made, for here, the likes of Whole Foods are but whispers on the wind. \n\nConstruction reigns as the king of industry, driven by the unquenched thirst for development. The open spaces call to the builders, urging them to transform the desert's face. It is a prospect that fills me with unease; the city I left behind whispers its siren song, and I find no desire to return. My hands find their purpose in the craft of drywall and T-bar, shaping the spaces where others will dwell.\n\nYet amid the encroaching change, the desert offers its own treasures. The creatures that call this harsh land home are a wonder to behold. My children, wild with the joy of discovery, chase lizards and bugs beneath the sun's watchful gaze. The high desert holds its secrets close, a beauty both stark and fragile.\n\nVictorville, with its peculiar charms, offers a taste of the desert's mystery. The San Bernardino County Fair casts its spell each year, a celebration of life beneath the endless sky. Nearby, Wrightwood beckons with its snow-capped peaks, a place where winter's breath can be felt. For those with a thirst for knowledge, the Victor Valley Museum stands as a guardian of stories, its halls echoing with the whispers of the past. Here, the land’s history and culture are laid bare, a testament to the resilience and spirit of this desert world.",
            "The world turns and the sun climbs over the horizon with a light that is ancient and indifferent. When asked to speak of my neighborhood, I reckon my tale might stray from the usual. Others, they might talk of homes with picket fences and the slow pulse of suburban life. My place is different. My neighborhood is a college campus, a sprawl of brick and mortar where the young and the searching gather in dormitories and lecture halls. This is my community, my tribe. The land around it, the campus, it too is my neighborhood, though a bit less so.\n\nIn its essence, my neighborhood is a reflection of the larger world. It has its dwellings, its people, its commerce, and its patches of green where one might find solace. Let me take you through these places. The \"houses\" here, they are of a kind distinct to this place. We have three sorts: the apartments, the houses, and the dormitories. In the apartments, rooms hold two to four souls, and floors stack upon floors, with twenty or so folks in a building. The houses, they stand apart, open to those bound to the school in some way or another. They are few, these houses, a rarity for those from days gone by. But the dormitories, they are the heart. Hundreds of students, each room a shared space, a common kind of living here.\n\nNow, about the people. The school takes pride in the tapestry of its folk. They come from lands far and near, of all ages and stories. The staff, they dwell in the houses, while the new blood fills the dorms, and the older ones find their place in the apartments. Words fall short in capturing their essence. Best to move on to the commerce and the green spaces of my neighborhood.\n\nThis school, it is a world unto itself. Stores line its paths, with food and wares like any town, but also goods marked by the school’s own hand. All that one could need lies within its bounds. And the park, a small oasis, a place where the diverse gather under the open sky. It is kept clean, a testament to the care of the community. This is my neighborhood, and here, all things find their place.",
            "There are no sidewalks where I live. The land slopes ever downward and my house clings to the summit of the hill, the steepest in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill. The joggers ascend its face each morning, their breath mingling with the fog. The street is without sidewalks and the folk must tread upon the asphalt, pitted and worn, a hazard to both foot and wheel. The wires that net the sky above are frayed and ragged, victims of the storms that rage through this place. The branches and debris strike them down and they rise again patched and piecemeal, a testament to resilience. Tall evergreens stand sentinel all around, their presence loathed by those who yearn for the sea’s expanse. They cut them down, these trees, to clear the path for the eye, to let the ocean’s horizon pour into their glass-fronted homes which rise like sentinels along the hill. At sunset the bay ignites with an inner fire and the sky bleeds orange, though more often the sun hides behind a veil of cloud. The days are gray and wet. Moss creeps where it will, a green shroud upon roofs and cars and railings. I left my car outside once and it grew a pelt of moss in a month’s time. Spent three hours scraping it clean. Children are scarce here though there’s a school just yonder. The old ones dwell in these parts, their days spent in quietude. Dogs abound in place of children, lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leave a door ajar and they’ll find their way inside. I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it out. Rabbits roam as well, their numbers thinned by the relentless hunt of the neighborhood’s cats. The gardeners curse them for the burrows they dig, the roots they sunder. Birds flit about, sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle driven off by crows. There are no stores here, but down the slope by the water’s edge lie a few eateries where the catch of the day is served. The beach is but a stony shore, yet the rocks invite the hand to cast them into the bay. The water stretches not far, the opposite shore plainly visible even through the mist’s embrace.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, there lies a place called Bensonhurst. It is not difficult to find. The public conveyances of New York City will bear you there without fail, for they are many and ceaseless in their comings and goings. Bensonhurst is a place of streets and corners, a place where the city breathes and moves with the rhythm of its own making. As you walk among its lanes, know that you have not left New York City, for it lingers in the very air you breathe.\n\nIn these parts, over the span of two decades, there has been a gathering of peoples from distant shores, and their presence is marked by the shops they have wrought. Each block is testament to their industry—a myriad of Asian-owned establishments, from supermarkets to laundromats, their signs calling out in colors and scripts foreign and familiar. The wares they offer are lauded by those who dwell here, for the quality is high and the price is not dear, and such convenience is a balm to the weary soul.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not solely of one people. It is a tapestry woven of many threads, immigrants and their children who have taken root in this soil. The businesses that rise and fall in this place are largely Asian-owned, but the people who walk these streets are of all kinds. There is even a park nearby, freshly tended and made anew, where children play and men engage in their games, where the fountains sing of summer, and all manner of folk mingle in the soft light of the evening.\n\nThe skyline is not marred by the towers of commerce, for here the structures are more humble: apartments and houses, places where families find their rest. The air is filled with noise, a cacophony of engines and music, a symphony that plays from dawn till dusk, and it is the song of the city itself.\n\nWhen night falls, carry with you a measure of caution, for though the streets are not perilous, the unknown lurks in the shadows. There are those who would trouble you for their own sport, and there are thieves who covet what is not theirs. I have known the sting of such encounters, though years have passed since then. And there are those who disregard the laws of cleanliness, leaving behind the leavings of their dogs for the unwary to tread upon. It is a trial to keep one's shoes unsoiled in such a place.\n\nSo if you come to Bensonhurst, come with eyes open and feet wary, for the city is a place of many wonders and many trials, and it is a place that will mark you as surely as you mark it.",
            "The first thing you must understand about Portland, Oregon is the nature of its strangeness. Upon the brick facade of a building that dabbles as a pizza parlor, a bar, a music hall, and a den of dubious repute, there is scrawled the town's unofficial creed: \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a faint echo of the Portland from the days gone by, a whisper of the city in the nineties and early aughts when it was less charted and less dear, a cradle for peculiar and vibrant subcultures. For others, it is an invitation - come to Portland, where they will call you strange, but with affection. Despite the tide of wealthy Californians and the rising sprawl of condominiums to house them, Portland remains strange. Strange does not mean unconditionally accepting, but it means embracing what the world often shuns. Strange does not imply a lack of modernity or its battles. Like the rest of the nation, we barter for most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be strange, to diverge from the ordinary, yet Portland holds its share of the mundane. We have yoga and hipsters and the suited professionals. Perhaps strange means we simply bear all this with less gravity. In my neighborhood, as in many of Portland's enclaves, we have houses painted in hues of whimsy, gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the curbs, and in the summer, boxes of giveaways. These free boxes, usually cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold the castaways of another, yet often something magical, a treasure awaiting the wanderer. They mostly contain clothes and books but can surprise with anything. The enchantment of meandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is the essence of what Portland means to me, though I am but one thread in a tapestry of peculiarity. Some folks I share this city with would never deign to pluck their garments from a roadside box. They find solace in goat yoga or at the Timbers’ roar. Portland brims with souls who love all manner of things. Portland is a city of dreamers, whether chasing those dreams or dreaming of chasing them while the nights slip away at the bar. Yes, there is a shadow of addiction here. Such shadows often cast their roots in the soil of mental unrest, and the unending rain and brooding skies seem to play their part. Portland grapples with homelessness as well, a plight without easy remedy. The homeless are drawn by what services the city can muster, services that outshine much of the nation, yet fall short as they do everywhere. The housed waver between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not strange at all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. In the north, they bear witness to the sun’s pilgrimage across the heavens at dawn and dusk. No matter how the world forgets them or how the tides of toil and life may pull me away, they remain, unyielding, untouched by the fleeting woes of men. On days when the weight of the world bears down upon me, they call out for my gaze, and as I turn to them, they offer solace to my restless spirit, lending me strength to press forward, one day at a time. It was when I first came here for my studies that I found my eyes drawn to the northern peaks that watched over the campus. True, the university boasts its own share of splendor in its edifices and waters and groves, which hold a part of my affection, but it is the mountains that reign supreme in my heart. The town itself is lovely in its way. There are countless cafés where hours of caffeine-driven study took place. One might walk or take the bus a short distance to the downtown, where the air hangs heavy with the past, in the faded bricks of eateries and offices. Here, this seeming suburb stirs with as much life and vigor as the nearby city. Yet, this bustle is but a brief affair, for one might slip away again into the quietude of the town with a mere pass by the library. This close juxtaposition of worlds lends the city a certain enchantment, inviting exploration. Thus, it is simple to weave many a fond memory, each tied to a corner of the town. Whether it be strolling past rusted swings in the park with friends after a night unended or racing through the vibrant downtown to catch a film at the grand theater courtesy of university tickets. But it is also a place of bitter recollections, as all locales inevitably are in the weave of life. The ponds, especially, serve as mirrors for contemplation and the occasional tearful vigil at two in the morning amid an existential storm. The latter, I know too well. As I watched the turtles and ducks and insects live their tiny dramas, each with a part to play, I pondered my own purpose as I navigated the enigma of existence. So I walked past the pond and the park and the little houses that spoke of suburbia until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its golden light upon the palms, painting the sky, and as I lifted my gaze to the dawn, I knew I was walking north. And sure enough, they were there, as they had ever been. The steadfast mountains touched the hazy blue and yellow sky more surely than any structure on the horizon, and as if through a silent language, they stirred within me a resolve to endure.",
            "In the first glance it might be a place you'd pass by unseeing. It's just a residential block tucked behind the strip of stores, not the kind of place one thinks of people making their homes. Yet homes they are. You head past the vacant Whole Foods, past the hotels that see life only in brief summer flares for family gatherings, and there you find the stirrings of a community. The streets hold the apartments, each one laid out in a deliberate line like dolls from a wooden set, each one taken apart and laid side by side, piecemeal. The first you see are the ones that have found their names in the news, unsavory tales that cast long shadows, but we won't linger there. For beyond them, the other complexes open into a world unknown to the wider town. Across, a community college's satellite campus stands with quiet dignity, its structures calm in their vigil by the roadside. The students come in their morning stupor, clutching coffees, yawning their way through the iron gates that open with a groan, while the commuters curse and moan, held back in the rush of a crowded morning. Where the road meets another, it finds a park on one edge and a rehab center on the other, where the broken make their slow recoveries. The center lays out its cheerful furniture under the slow churn of a ceiling fan, pushing the summer's heavy air back and forth. Over in the park, children tumble through the grass, bees linger over flowers, while old folks trail their dogs, casting wary eyes at the skateboarders and nodding to the girls gathered by the playground, their talk of boys and the latest on YouTube. There’s a sushi joint in the strip mall next to the park, its food cheap, its tables rarely full. Next to it, a swimming supply store and a nail salon, a trifecta where you might attend to your pool, your nails, and your hunger all at once. The frozen yogurt shop stands there too, teenagers wandering out with sweating cups, covered in every imaginable topping, skateboarding and vaping with the air of those who think it makes them cool. This neighborhood, it's a stitch in the fabric of America, a piece of history in the drowsy South where nothing ever seems to change, not even time itself.",
            "The neighborhood stands as a testament to times bygone, its homes mostly single-family affairs, though a few have been cleaved in twain and yet remain bound, if sense can be made of such contrivance. My own dwelling sits with a small yard before it, a modest driveway to its left, akin to most others here, calling forth memories of an era when suburban life was the very heart of the American dream. A dream that once cradled the nation close but now drifts ever so slightly from our grasp. Yet these neighborhoods endure, whispering still to those who wander through them that the dream lives on, an echo of hope in a world grown indifferent. The folk here, they don't hold the hope they once did, the neatness of their lawns waning with the years. Still, cars nestle in driveways, and the children play as though the world beyond held no sway over their small lives. The public school, nearing its ninetieth year, stands as a relic and a promise, sparking futures in the young and nostalgia in the old. Churches scatter sparsely, their pews empty, but the courts ring with the sound of basketball games. Each house bears its own visage but shares a common soul. There's a supermarket named Super A, run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs in this place where most faces are African American. The streets spread wide, a field for children’s games, interrupted only by the passage of cars. Generations have rooted here, weaving stories of a time when every neighbor was known, when a karate school thrived until the allure of Hollywood's martial tales waned, leaving behind a pharmacy in its stead, for medicine, it seems, is the solace now sought. A small theater, too, clings on, offering old films to those who cherish them, the youth's disdain leaving it untroubled by crowds, a retreat for the elders who value its modest price for an evening’s respite. An expressway cuts through the town, though its access lies beyond our borders. A petition once rose to claim an exit for our place, championed by the young, yet the elders, fearing the change it might herald, swayed the council to let it pass unheeded. A new high school rises, and the question of a mascot lingers. I reckon a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin backdrop might suit this peculiar town just fine.",
            "In the sprawl of this vast city where the land stretches and bends under the weight of its own making, the neighborhood stands as a testament to the ceaseless dance of diversity. Here, the residential quarters scatter like leaves in the wind, interspersed among the bustling commerce of human enterprise. Offices rise alongside shops and eateries and places where music and laughter spill into the night air like whispers of a bygone era. There is no end to the newness of flavors and wares that tempt the wanderer’s heart. The grand emporiums of well-hewn brands stand shoulder to shoulder with the small boutiques that charm the passerby with their quaint allure. They hug the streets, threading through the city like veins, reaching into neighborhoods that might once have known the quiet of a gentle dawn but for the clamor of life that surrounds them.\n\nAnd there are parks, too. The earth there is well-trodden by the feet of young children and their guardians who seek respite under the canopy of ancient trees. The people themselves, they are a tapestry of the world. In one corner, an LGBTQ+ community thrives, while the traditions of Orthodox Jews echo through another. Refugees and immigrants from the old lands of the Soviet Union carve out their space, their stories weaving into the fabric of this place. Beyond these streets, the city unfurls into Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and the like—each its own universe, each just a stone’s throw away yet sometimes a journey of hours due to the serpentine traffic that grips the city in its iron grasp. Though the distances are not great, the time spent among the choked paths of asphalt is interminable. Feet rarely touch the ground here, for the city sprawls too wide, its veins clogged with the metal and exhaust of vehicles seeking a path through its heart.\n\nThe irony of construction rises like a specter, for in this place where space is scarce, new towers climb skyward in defiance of the crowded streets below. The city draws them in, but its residents gaze upon the growing skyline with trepidation, knowing well the burden of more souls and more machines. Yet, not all dwell within these monoliths. Homes diverse as the city itself dot the landscape: houses, small apartments, and condos, single-family dwellings beside duplexes. Even in this, there is diversity. The neighborhood breathes with lives of all ages, though the days of familiarity with those who live next door seem a distant memory. Childhood echoes with laughter in the streets, the shadows of friendships cast long ago, when the world seemed smaller and simpler. Now, it is a place of strangers, each living within their own story, the threads of which seldom intertwine.",
            "Where is everything she asked as we drove through the cornfields that stretched to the horizon like the boundless sea. This is it I said and I saw the surprise in her eyes at the vastness of it all. She came from a place where the grocery store was a short walk from her door and never had she seen such openness. The endless fields of corn rose and fell like waves and I told her of life in rural Ohio and she began to understand who I was and where I had come from. We traveled down a two-lane country road past a quarry filled with water, and beyond that lay the small development I called home. The houses were of brick and stucco, each set upon a generous half acre, and the folks there took pride in their land. Springtime brought a riot of flowers and the trees that lined the streets changed with the seasons as if to mark the passage of time. The driveways sparkled with high-end Mercedes Benz cars, gleaming under the sun after a wash. As we neared my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor was in his yard as always, with a smile on his face. He spent the days mowing his lawn, singing above the drone of his John Deere, and though he was a source of amusement to many, he was genuine and his past was rich with stories. Once a doctor, now he seemed to merge with the grass and the machine he rode. We came to my house at last. In the side yard, geese wandered and our Terrier gave chase. Behind the house, a stream fed the quarry, and there you could hear the call of bullfrogs, the murmur of water, and the distant lowing of cows from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis of trees and wildflowers, where I spent my childhood days. We built forts among the branches and chased the animals, a game we called hunting. There was always something to do, a friend to find. Winters here were harsh but held a beauty all their own. The green yard turned to a wilderness, the trees stripped bare by the cold. When snow fell, it cloaked the land in a silent wonder. My sister's snow angels dotted the ground, and snowmen stood guard. We fought as siblings do, with snowballs for weapons, and built forts of snow and branches to defend ourselves. In that snowy world, we played pretend, children without a care, lost in the magic of the moment."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Out in the heart of Rural America, in a small township of Michigan, the land stretches from the fields to the sparse tourist havens. Here, there are no sprawling malls, no Wal-mart nor Target, not even a solitary Applebee’s to mark the landscape. Every venture requires the road beneath your wheels. Yet, these lands are graced with a beauty that the world seldom knows, bordered by water, where the expanse of Lake Michigan meets with Lake Charlevoix. The very air is laced with the scent of distant waters, and beaches lie waiting for those who seek them. This neighborhood holds the spirit of the small town, where homes do not crowd upon one another but stand in their own time-worn grace. They are no mere replicas, these houses, but individual in their history and bearing. Some wear the marks of age and some the touch of renewal. Basements lie beneath them, full and visible from the roadside. The aluminum siding of old endures on many a home, and the palette of colors echoes through the blocks. Yards stretch out with trampolines and playsets, gardens and fences holding back the small lives within. It is Middle America, where folks labor for their keep, raising their families or remembering when they did. Children’s laughter spills into the streets, mingling with the sound of dogs and the whisper of wheels on pavement. Neighbors nod to neighbors, knowing who belongs and who does not. A man might stand by his grill and wave, or a passerby with a dog might offer a smile. The lawns are tended, leaves long gone with the fall, and the grass remains green and clipped. The plants and bushes, they too are kept in their place. This is no neighborhood of grandeur, but one where a life might be well lived, its quiet and peace a balm. It is average, yet within this ordinariness lies the extraordinary, a place of safety at day's end. A short walk leads to the sheriff’s office, the jail, and the health department, all settled in their places. The recycling center down the road serves the people, and beyond, the fields of play where the voices of announcers drift on the air. The small-town airport lies beyond, its engines a distant rumble. Ice cream waits at the local stand, and downtown is close enough if you’ve a mind to walk. The park is a mere eight blocks away, where children ride their bikes and laughter fills the air. Truly, it is a place worthy of calling home.",
            "In the place where I make my home, the world is carved out in neat rows and lines, a testament to the artifice of men. It bears the mark of suburban design, each house a mirror to its neighbor, each street a tale of symmetry enforced by the iron hand of the homeowner's association. As you cross the threshold into this realm, the houses stand in their sanitized glory, their facades polished by the relentless insistence of the association. The lawns are a testament to uniformity, each a small green patch bordered by stones, the driveways brief and indistinct. Now and again, a tree rises, though small and sparse, as if hesitant to break the mold.\n\nGarages yawn wide enough for two cars, and the roads, they gleam with the sheen of fresh concrete, unmarred by the wounds of time and neglect. The houses, mostly single-storied, rise occasionally to two, but never so much as to disrupt the horizon. Here, the mail does not come to the door but sits in clustered boxes at the street's end, keys the only means of entry, the HOA's creed of sameness etched into every detail.\n\nWe lie on the city's edge, straddling the line between the rural and the suburban, land stretching wide and open. Pools and paths, the bounty of community planning, invite the residents to linger, to wander without leaving the bounds of this well-tended enclave. It's a place where folks, mostly those who've seen the years pass by, find safety and solace, their lives intertwined in quiet harmony. A few younger souls pepper the landscape, professionals carving out their own paths in this ordered world.\n\nThe city beyond, vast in number but not in spirit, holds its own peculiar charm. It offers what you need and maybe more, a single mall the heart of commerce, modest in size but ample in purpose. Fifteen minutes on the road and you're met with myriad choices, from grocers of refinement to shops of austerity. Here, the neighborhood stands, a testament to safety and maintenance, a slice of the ordinary rendered in the language of man's design, where the pools reflect the sky and the trails lead you home.",
            "The first whisper of my place came to me through the ether of a podcast, a tale spun of the vanished, and it sat uneasy in the mind. Surprising it was, amid these apartments priced dearer than gold it seemed, each one a thousand dollars and more for the mere privilege of sleep. No recollection of such stories had ever crossed my ears, nor those of my friends. Perhaps it was the struggle that bound us, those nights when tears fell unbidden from eyes accustomed to the hard truths of frugality. The years had taught us a sharpness, a way to find solace in the scent of toys long forgotten and clothes buried in mothballs. The smells of adulthood, they fade and blur, smoking out the edges of memory until only dust and time remain. Flea markets, they always break through, their scent of age and life insistent like old magazines piled high upon a forgotten piano. The dust settles deep into leather, a stubborn guest refusing eviction. \n\nHere the thrifts are three, each within steps of the other, a pilgrimage of sorts. A walk that takes you through charity’s embrace, the whisper of books long out of print, and the oddities of a curio shop. Downtown swells with the tide of cars and people, a river of life that flows unceasingly, yet within the thrifts, silence reigns. The world outside may clamor, but here the quiet holds sway, a sanctuary for the lost hours of an afternoon. \n\nEvery year the city swells, its arteries clogged with the pulse of progress, this place they say is burgeoning, clutching at the hems of a digital empire vast and sprawling. It brings to mind the old city, New York, where the multitudes pursue their solitary purposes and ask little from you save to leave them be. Here, anonymity is a right, an unspoken pact. Unlike the South, where concern weaves through the fabric of civility, here the shell is yours to keep, the city indifferent as the tide, crashing and receding against the shore of your solitude. \n\nYet for all its modern sprawl, life persists in the spaces between. A pianist next door, voices raised in song from above, a symphony of life in the midst of concrete. It’s less an apartment of strangers, more a tapestry of lives intertwined. We gather, we celebrate, we mourn, we help. In this, luck finds me, wrapped in the kindness of neighbors who reach out as I do in return. We share the small acts of living, the mail, the meals, the presence that reassures. It is they who remind me that in this vast expanse of steel and stone, I have not lost myself entirely.",
            "I dwell in a modest town laid upon the plains of the Midwest, just beyond the reach of a sprawling city. On the eastern fringe of this town lies my neighborhood, a place where the weight of economic hardship settles like dust. The houses here stand as humble sentinels, their worth measured in the currency of struggle, owned or rented by souls who bear the burden of scant means. Yet, it is not a place stripped of beauty or bereft of spirit. Walk the streets and you'll find faces turned to you in greeting, a community bound by the thin thread of shared existence. Crime does cast its shadow, darker here than other quarters, but still it is a shadow not yet monstrous. In the past decade, violence has visited these streets, leaving behind echoes of gunfire and the cold silence of loss. Our neighbors next door, their son claimed by a bullet outside a dim-lit bar just last year. By grace or fortune, our family has been spared such direct sorrow, save for the petty theft of forgotten items on our porch. The town bears the scars of a wider plague, the scourge of opioids that has swept across this land. Lives have been claimed by the insidious grip of fentanyl, but in this place, there is a flicker of resistance. Resources stand ready, addiction centers and Narcan trainings offering a lifeline to those teetering on the edge. Despite the shadows, this town holds its virtues. My son's elementary school, a beacon of hope, staffed by those who nurture with compassion. Even with his special needs, he finds no torment here, only acceptance in an atmosphere charged with positivity. The PTO, ever industrious, orchestrates gatherings to weave families into the fabric of education. Hunger finds no purchase here, with meals freely given to all, a testament to the town's refusal to let poverty strip dignity from its children. The City Council, in its wisdom, has sought to polish the face of our town, roads renewed and parks reborn, though these efforts lean westward, leaving our side of town to languish. This neglect breeds discontent among us who dwell in its shadow. Yet, I find contentment in this place. The people, warm and genuine, the schools a nurturing ground, and the shops, both quaint and grand, suffice for our needs. Our home, though modest in worth, cradles us in comfort. Sixteen years we have called this place ours, and the thought of elsewhere is but a whisper in the wind.",
            "In the hills where my home lies, there's a tapestry of the past woven into every corner. The neighborhood sits upon a rise, and its structures speak in whispers of the old world. Seven stories tall, my apartment stands across from a theater that once breathed life, and down the slope rests a curious arcade bar, drawing a medley of souls when the summer's breath is warm. On weekends in the heart of June and July, a line snakes out, folk eager for the revelry within. Nearby, the city park sprawls, its breadth surprising for its place among the urban sprawl. Encircling it is the gray of concrete, steps molded into its face. Winter comes with a bite, and the unsheltered erect their camps in orderly rows along those steps, the chill biting but less so for the closeness. The rain falls more than snow, and in those torrents of midwinter, warmth is a fugitive thing. But the heart of the city is nearer than the wilderness, and the sanctuary of a family center beckons, offering a place to wash away the grime.\n\nYet it is not the beauty of architecture or the proud history that holds me. It is the spirit of the people that binds me to this place. Hilltop, once a name spoken in fear, known for blood and violence on the western shores. The tales linger, ghostly echoes of federal forces sweeping through like a storm to cleanse the streets. Memories persist, passed down like heirlooms, even to newcomers like me. The labor of the people is unending, their hands worn from striving to transform what was once notorious. They hold a fierce pride, a vigilance over their domain. Whispers caution the pale-skinned to tread lightly after dusk, a relic of bygone days, stained with the bitterness of old prejudices. Perhaps my complexion shields me, or perhaps Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, a witness to the scars that mar our land. Scars of bigotry, of ingrained fear and ignorance, even in a city that fancies itself a mosaic of cultures. But in my heart, I know: the Hilltop is my anchor. In the night, I walk those streets, alive and unafraid, met with kindness more often than malice. A place of small mercies, where doors stay open a moment longer for refuge from the storm. Where strangers pause, see me in my solitude, and offer a word of grace, a reminder of worth amidst the gloom.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world seemed vast and unyielding. At first, friends were hard to come by, but soon enough, I found kinship with a boy two doors down and another who lived along the same stretch of road. They've both moved on, but the echoes of our shared days linger, like whispers caught in the wind. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived have stayed, their lives threading through the fabric of this place like the steady ticking of a clock. This neighborhood is much like any American suburb, with its rows of two-story houses standing sentinel under the wide sky. \n\nOn weekends, or whenever the sun graces us with its warmth, the laughter of children rises up, a bright chorus against the quietude that fills the weekdays. Here, folks leave you be unless need calls them to your side. Not once has a package vanished from my porch. There's a trust among us that feels as solid as the earth beneath our feet. Just down the way, a park beckons, a mere minute's walk from my door. It's a place heavy with memories, of games played and friendships forged. There, too, is the memory of a football game that left me with a bloodied nose, a sharp reminder amid the softer recollections. Now, the park is a playground for my cousin's young ones, their delight in swings and slides a testament to the simple joys that endure. \n\nThe park draws from me a deep nostalgia, a longing for days past. This neighborhood is a tapestry of cultures, with flavors from Chinese to Indian, Mexican to Italian, all within a stone's throw. Yet, the ease of modern life has many turning to the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash, though fast food reigns supreme as it does in most suburban sprawls. Pizza joints abound, each with its own claim to fame. The stores here cater to every need, from dry cleaners to the familiar glow of Walgreens and CVS. Jewel-Osco stands as a beacon of Midwestern commerce. Among the stores, an Indian-owned shop offers the spices and flavors of home for those who seek it.\n\nI've grown fond of this place. The tales of discord and strife in other neighborhoods, shared across the digital ether, only deepen my gratitude for the peace I find among these quiet streets.",
            "The college stands not far from my dwelling and for this I take comfort in its proximity, the neighborhood a tapestry of apartment blocks and the odd establishment where one might find diversion or drink without ruinous expense. A bar has changed its name and with it the price of entry, though the quality holds its own. The folk here are of two sorts, students mostly or those of modest means, the rent a mercy to the latter. Children abound, drawn by the nearby elementary, their laughter a constant chorus beneath the trees that crowd the grounds of my abode. I know not the people who share these walls, nor do I wish to. Their smoke seeps through the halls and in response the management has mounted a contraption to mask the scent, a gesture both absurd and amusing to my companion and me. The buildings stand with age upon them, their facades weary though the interiors may surprise. Down the way rise new edifices, but they are no better for their youth, hastily erected and demanding a sum none should pay. There is a place to eat where the fare comes on paper and the microwave hums in the kitchen, the opposite a gas station where work is not for the faint of heart. The city saw fit to mend the road, laying down a path wide enough for two abreast and soft with grass at its edges. Yet the place I call home is cloaked in trees, their numbers diminished but still they stand sentinel. Behind, another street runs parallel, though it shows a rougher face, the walkways crumbling and the edifices in disrepair. Trees here serve as a shield, their shade covering the flaws. Crime has made its mark, more on the street behind than here, yet it is not an isolated blight. Across the way lies a haunt of transient souls and troubles aplenty. Still, I find a liking for my corner of the world. It is within my means and serviceable, the university a short stroll and the buses waiting to ferry me to the heart of the town or the market as needed.",
            "The neighborhood lay at the end of a cul-de-sac, a clutch of duplexes painted all the same yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, set down among fields and trees like a small village lost in time. There was a sense of kinship among those who lived here, neighbors gathering in the evenings at the edge of someone’s driveway, watching children with their kites and chalk, as if the world outside had ceased its relentless pace. The sky stretched overhead, blue and vast, the clouds a billowing white. Yet even here the world could not be kept at bay. Tornado warnings had scattered the tranquility, the sirens calling out in the night like some ancient lament. I found myself curled in the bathtub with my smallest dog, clutching purse and pillows as the hail battered the earth outside. My larger dog refused the sanctuary, pacing the living room with nervous barks. The aftermath left the roads steaming, the temperature falling from sweltering to cool in the span of moments. As the clouds parted, the sun spilled through and a double rainbow arched across the sky. I fetched my camera, capturing the moment to share with those far away. The neighborhood held its breath a while longer before life returned to its habitual rhythms, mothers calling children to dinner, the air filled with the scent of cooking. \n\nFor one who has recently moved from the granite hills of New Hampshire to this North Carolina hamlet, the southern drawl is a song unto itself. The homes are outwardly identical, two bedrooms and two baths, yet within them, they differ. Some are small to the point of puzzlement. I wander the field behind my home, path leading to a pond where deer sometimes gather and in the morning the bullfrog sings his deep song. It is a place removed, yet close enough to Charlotte that the city’s reach is felt. Each day begins with the crow of roosters from surrounding farms, the evenings echo with the bray of a donkey from a nearby farm. It is a strange grace to have stumbled upon such a haven.",
            "In the long expanse of time, ten years seems a blink, yet here I am with the dust settled upon the memories of my coming. There was a sadness when I first set foot in this place, a melancholy that clung like the morning fog. From Riverdale to Stockbridge, I journeyed, and tears were my companion, for I left behind the familiar, the beloved. My parents, seeking what was best for me and my sister, led us to this new land, a place of promise and opportunity, far removed from the shadows of our past.\n\nIn the early days, the streets were strange and unyielding, but as the years folded into one another, I found my footing. New friends emerged from the shadows, and with them, new foes. The neighbors were distant, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis who dwelled close by. Their kindness was a balm in the wilderness, and I came to hold them dear, like kin. I recall with clarity the day we attended Mr. Glen's wedding anew, a celebration that spoke of hope and renewal. There was joy in the air, and laughter danced in the night as I caught the white garter Ms. Veda tossed. But the flowers eluded me.\n\nThe neighborhood is a labyrinth, its paths winding and secretive, though a GPS now guides my wanderings. My explorations were often shared with Kason and Curtis, comrades in the simple pleasures of youth. Together, we delved into the world of video games and the unhurried joy of existence. The park offered solace, a place where nature whispered calm into my restless soul. There, I practiced balance with sticks from the depot, my wooden sword a companion in the dance of solitude.\n\nCourts of basketball and tennis stood silent, relics of a past when my father and Mr. Graves taught us the game of tennis. The memory of their lessons still echoes, a testament to the sweat and laughter shared. Fun was never in short supply in this place, and though many tales could be told, these are the ones that linger. Yet, I hold a quiet belief that the finest days remain ahead, waiting to unfurl their stories.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town like so many others, yet it calls itself the Peach Capital of the World. Johnston, with its fields rolling out under endless skies, holds its secrets in the soil and the trees heavy with fruit. On the sign that welcomes you, this boast is etched, though the town speaks softly in its quiet way. Here, the earth is parceled into farms where peach trees stand sentinel or cattle graze in languid contemplation. Homes stand apart, two-storied and roofed in metal or shingle, set back from the roads, yielding the front fields to the sun and the rain and the toil of men.\n\nIn the town's heart, a solitary stoplight hangs over a crossroads, casting its red and green eyes upon the few places folks gather. Hong Kong, with its modest offerings from a far land, and Fiesta Mexican, where the air is spiced with distant flavors, and Gary's, a burger chain that spins tales of America on its sizzling grills. Once, a pizzeria served its own kind of alchemy, but its ovens are now cold.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, whose fame rests not on its prescriptions but on the sweet bite of Cherry Coca-Cola, stands alongside the Independent Grocers Alliance, a store known more by its letters, IGA. Though sole in its kind, it sees its patrons more for trifles than for the feast of groceries, who journey instead to Batesburg-Leesville for the abundance of Walmart. Dollar General holds the town's affections, its aisles a march of necessity from dawn till dusk.\n\nIn the corner of this world, Possibilities Furniture & More stands, its keeper a woman whose kindness maps the town. Movers ply their trade under her employ, delivering the promise of comfort to waiting homes. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels caters to creatures both great and small, offering care and respite.\n\nThe doctor and the vet, each with their small practice, tend to the body and soul of Johnston's creatures. And the young ones learn their letters at Johnston Elementary, until the world calls them to the neighboring town's schools. Parks there are none, but plans are laid for a patch of green where families might gather under the open sky.\n\nFor all its lacks, Johnston holds its charm in its simplicity. A town so small and unassuming, you might pass it by and not know it, a whisper on the wind as you journey on.",
            "In the heart of a small Tennessee town, where the lands stretch out in quiet repose, I find my home nestled in the suburb's embrace, a place where time moves in its own unhurried measure. The street that ties our lives together winds between two state highways, and though the passage of cars is more frequent than my liking, the neighborhood holds its peace like a well-kept secret. The faces here have become familiar, for few come or go, and in their constancy, I find a comfort like the sun's daily return. The people tend to their yards and the small labors of life that stitch the hours together. Winter comes and we take to sledding down the hill, a brief and joyful flight on our side street. Our house stands on the corner, a sentinel watching the comings and goings, and in this way, we know each car and each journey by heart. When a foreign vehicle appears, it is marked by our eyes, as if the land itself notes the intrusion. Neighbors wander the roads, some for the exercise, some led by the leashes of their dogs. Children, with the abandon of youth, weave their bicycles through the air. We remain home more often than not, our work tethered to the house. There are four souls here: myself, my wife, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen, growing up in this quiet corner of the world. Our presence is known, just as we know theirs. We play outside, even under the rain's gentle insistence. At times, the back deck becomes an altar to the grill, smoke and scent mingling with the air—a promise of warmth and gathering. The drone of lawnmowers is a constant from March to October, a soundtrack to the growing season. Trees abound, remnants of the woods that once held sway, offering shade in summer and a burden of leaves in the fall, demanding the rake and the fire. I savor the scent of burning leaves, the autumn's signature, though winter comes now as a pale shadow of itself, leaving us with an endless fall. The garage at the back of the house serves as my retreat, a place for the truck and other endeavors, and when the doors swing open, I feel the pulse of the neighborhood beat stronger in my veins. Holidays descend with a gentle hush, Thanksgiving's arrival marked by unfamiliar cars crowding the streets as families reunite. Mother’s Day and Christmas bring the same quiet flurry. In all its simplicity, I find I am content here. Were it not for the road that carries strangers through our midst, it would be a perfect place indeed.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where dust and grit lay claim to the earth, my neighborhood sprawls beneath an endless sky. The land here is a tapestry of brown, a harsh and unyielding hue that stretches as far as the eye can see. Only those who've set foot in this place can truly understand the relentless presence of the earth's bare bones. When a patch of green appears, it is a testament to toil and expense, a small rebellion against the desert's dominion. Back in the nineties, the homes were scattered like seeds cast upon the wind, and though the land remains much the same, new structures rise like sentinels of change. The city creeps ever closer, its edges blurring into the desert's vastness, as if it were a living thing, always growing, always hungry. \n\nIn this place, the people are warm and welcoming, but like any city, shadows linger where the sun does not reach. My own corner of this world is watched over by gentle souls, the elders who have seen the sands shift and change. The stores that dot our streets bear familiar names, chains that have planted their roots in this arid soil. For a taste of the finer things, a journey must be made, for here, the likes of Whole Foods are but whispers on the wind. \n\nConstruction reigns as the king of industry, driven by the unquenched thirst for development. The open spaces call to the builders, urging them to transform the desert's face. It is a prospect that fills me with unease; the city I left behind whispers its siren song, and I find no desire to return. My hands find their purpose in the craft of drywall and T-bar, shaping the spaces where others will dwell.\n\nYet amid the encroaching change, the desert offers its own treasures. The creatures that call this harsh land home are a wonder to behold. My children, wild with the joy of discovery, chase lizards and bugs beneath the sun's watchful gaze. The high desert holds its secrets close, a beauty both stark and fragile.\n\nVictorville, with its peculiar charms, offers a taste of the desert's mystery. The San Bernardino County Fair casts its spell each year, a celebration of life beneath the endless sky. Nearby, Wrightwood beckons with its snow-capped peaks, a place where winter's breath can be felt. For those with a thirst for knowledge, the Victor Valley Museum stands as a guardian of stories, its halls echoing with the whispers of the past. Here, the land’s history and culture are laid bare, a testament to the resilience and spirit of this desert world.",
            "The world turns and the sun climbs over the horizon with a light that is ancient and indifferent. When asked to speak of my neighborhood, I reckon my tale might stray from the usual. Others, they might talk of homes with picket fences and the slow pulse of suburban life. My place is different. My neighborhood is a college campus, a sprawl of brick and mortar where the young and the searching gather in dormitories and lecture halls. This is my community, my tribe. The land around it, the campus, it too is my neighborhood, though a bit less so.\n\nIn its essence, my neighborhood is a reflection of the larger world. It has its dwellings, its people, its commerce, and its patches of green where one might find solace. Let me take you through these places. The \"houses\" here, they are of a kind distinct to this place. We have three sorts: the apartments, the houses, and the dormitories. In the apartments, rooms hold two to four souls, and floors stack upon floors, with twenty or so folks in a building. The houses, they stand apart, open to those bound to the school in some way or another. They are few, these houses, a rarity for those from days gone by. But the dormitories, they are the heart. Hundreds of students, each room a shared space, a common kind of living here.\n\nNow, about the people. The school takes pride in the tapestry of its folk. They come from lands far and near, of all ages and stories. The staff, they dwell in the houses, while the new blood fills the dorms, and the older ones find their place in the apartments. Words fall short in capturing their essence. Best to move on to the commerce and the green spaces of my neighborhood.\n\nThis school, it is a world unto itself. Stores line its paths, with food and wares like any town, but also goods marked by the school’s own hand. All that one could need lies within its bounds. And the park, a small oasis, a place where the diverse gather under the open sky. It is kept clean, a testament to the care of the community. This is my neighborhood, and here, all things find their place.",
            "There are no sidewalks where I live. The land slopes ever downward and my house clings to the summit of the hill, the steepest in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill. The joggers ascend its face each morning, their breath mingling with the fog. The street is without sidewalks and the folk must tread upon the asphalt, pitted and worn, a hazard to both foot and wheel. The wires that net the sky above are frayed and ragged, victims of the storms that rage through this place. The branches and debris strike them down and they rise again patched and piecemeal, a testament to resilience. Tall evergreens stand sentinel all around, their presence loathed by those who yearn for the sea’s expanse. They cut them down, these trees, to clear the path for the eye, to let the ocean’s horizon pour into their glass-fronted homes which rise like sentinels along the hill. At sunset the bay ignites with an inner fire and the sky bleeds orange, though more often the sun hides behind a veil of cloud. The days are gray and wet. Moss creeps where it will, a green shroud upon roofs and cars and railings. I left my car outside once and it grew a pelt of moss in a month’s time. Spent three hours scraping it clean. Children are scarce here though there’s a school just yonder. The old ones dwell in these parts, their days spent in quietude. Dogs abound in place of children, lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leave a door ajar and they’ll find their way inside. I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it out. Rabbits roam as well, their numbers thinned by the relentless hunt of the neighborhood’s cats. The gardeners curse them for the burrows they dig, the roots they sunder. Birds flit about, sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle driven off by crows. There are no stores here, but down the slope by the water’s edge lie a few eateries where the catch of the day is served. The beach is but a stony shore, yet the rocks invite the hand to cast them into the bay. The water stretches not far, the opposite shore plainly visible even through the mist’s embrace.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, there lies a place called Bensonhurst. It is not difficult to find. The public conveyances of New York City will bear you there without fail, for they are many and ceaseless in their comings and goings. Bensonhurst is a place of streets and corners, a place where the city breathes and moves with the rhythm of its own making. As you walk among its lanes, know that you have not left New York City, for it lingers in the very air you breathe.\n\nIn these parts, over the span of two decades, there has been a gathering of peoples from distant shores, and their presence is marked by the shops they have wrought. Each block is testament to their industry—a myriad of Asian-owned establishments, from supermarkets to laundromats, their signs calling out in colors and scripts foreign and familiar. The wares they offer are lauded by those who dwell here, for the quality is high and the price is not dear, and such convenience is a balm to the weary soul.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not solely of one people. It is a tapestry woven of many threads, immigrants and their children who have taken root in this soil. The businesses that rise and fall in this place are largely Asian-owned, but the people who walk these streets are of all kinds. There is even a park nearby, freshly tended and made anew, where children play and men engage in their games, where the fountains sing of summer, and all manner of folk mingle in the soft light of the evening.\n\nThe skyline is not marred by the towers of commerce, for here the structures are more humble: apartments and houses, places where families find their rest. The air is filled with noise, a cacophony of engines and music, a symphony that plays from dawn till dusk, and it is the song of the city itself.\n\nWhen night falls, carry with you a measure of caution, for though the streets are not perilous, the unknown lurks in the shadows. There are those who would trouble you for their own sport, and there are thieves who covet what is not theirs. I have known the sting of such encounters, though years have passed since then. And there are those who disregard the laws of cleanliness, leaving behind the leavings of their dogs for the unwary to tread upon. It is a trial to keep one's shoes unsoiled in such a place.\n\nSo if you come to Bensonhurst, come with eyes open and feet wary, for the city is a place of many wonders and many trials, and it is a place that will mark you as surely as you mark it.",
            "The first thing you must understand about Portland, Oregon is the nature of its strangeness. Upon the brick facade of a building that dabbles as a pizza parlor, a bar, a music hall, and a den of dubious repute, there is scrawled the town's unofficial creed: \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a faint echo of the Portland from the days gone by, a whisper of the city in the nineties and early aughts when it was less charted and less dear, a cradle for peculiar and vibrant subcultures. For others, it is an invitation - come to Portland, where they will call you strange, but with affection. Despite the tide of wealthy Californians and the rising sprawl of condominiums to house them, Portland remains strange. Strange does not mean unconditionally accepting, but it means embracing what the world often shuns. Strange does not imply a lack of modernity or its battles. Like the rest of the nation, we barter for most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be strange, to diverge from the ordinary, yet Portland holds its share of the mundane. We have yoga and hipsters and the suited professionals. Perhaps strange means we simply bear all this with less gravity. In my neighborhood, as in many of Portland's enclaves, we have houses painted in hues of whimsy, gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the curbs, and in the summer, boxes of giveaways. These free boxes, usually cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold the castaways of another, yet often something magical, a treasure awaiting the wanderer. They mostly contain clothes and books but can surprise with anything. The enchantment of meandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is the essence of what Portland means to me, though I am but one thread in a tapestry of peculiarity. Some folks I share this city with would never deign to pluck their garments from a roadside box. They find solace in goat yoga or at the Timbers’ roar. Portland brims with souls who love all manner of things. Portland is a city of dreamers, whether chasing those dreams or dreaming of chasing them while the nights slip away at the bar. Yes, there is a shadow of addiction here. Such shadows often cast their roots in the soil of mental unrest, and the unending rain and brooding skies seem to play their part. Portland grapples with homelessness as well, a plight without easy remedy. The homeless are drawn by what services the city can muster, services that outshine much of the nation, yet fall short as they do everywhere. The housed waver between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not strange at all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. In the north, they bear witness to the sun’s pilgrimage across the heavens at dawn and dusk. No matter how the world forgets them or how the tides of toil and life may pull me away, they remain, unyielding, untouched by the fleeting woes of men. On days when the weight of the world bears down upon me, they call out for my gaze, and as I turn to them, they offer solace to my restless spirit, lending me strength to press forward, one day at a time. It was when I first came here for my studies that I found my eyes drawn to the northern peaks that watched over the campus. True, the university boasts its own share of splendor in its edifices and waters and groves, which hold a part of my affection, but it is the mountains that reign supreme in my heart. The town itself is lovely in its way. There are countless cafés where hours of caffeine-driven study took place. One might walk or take the bus a short distance to the downtown, where the air hangs heavy with the past, in the faded bricks of eateries and offices. Here, this seeming suburb stirs with as much life and vigor as the nearby city. Yet, this bustle is but a brief affair, for one might slip away again into the quietude of the town with a mere pass by the library. This close juxtaposition of worlds lends the city a certain enchantment, inviting exploration. Thus, it is simple to weave many a fond memory, each tied to a corner of the town. Whether it be strolling past rusted swings in the park with friends after a night unended or racing through the vibrant downtown to catch a film at the grand theater courtesy of university tickets. But it is also a place of bitter recollections, as all locales inevitably are in the weave of life. The ponds, especially, serve as mirrors for contemplation and the occasional tearful vigil at two in the morning amid an existential storm. The latter, I know too well. As I watched the turtles and ducks and insects live their tiny dramas, each with a part to play, I pondered my own purpose as I navigated the enigma of existence. So I walked past the pond and the park and the little houses that spoke of suburbia until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its golden light upon the palms, painting the sky, and as I lifted my gaze to the dawn, I knew I was walking north. And sure enough, they were there, as they had ever been. The steadfast mountains touched the hazy blue and yellow sky more surely than any structure on the horizon, and as if through a silent language, they stirred within me a resolve to endure.",
            "In the first glance it might be a place you'd pass by unseeing. It's just a residential block tucked behind the strip of stores, not the kind of place one thinks of people making their homes. Yet homes they are. You head past the vacant Whole Foods, past the hotels that see life only in brief summer flares for family gatherings, and there you find the stirrings of a community. The streets hold the apartments, each one laid out in a deliberate line like dolls from a wooden set, each one taken apart and laid side by side, piecemeal. The first you see are the ones that have found their names in the news, unsavory tales that cast long shadows, but we won't linger there. For beyond them, the other complexes open into a world unknown to the wider town. Across, a community college's satellite campus stands with quiet dignity, its structures calm in their vigil by the roadside. The students come in their morning stupor, clutching coffees, yawning their way through the iron gates that open with a groan, while the commuters curse and moan, held back in the rush of a crowded morning. Where the road meets another, it finds a park on one edge and a rehab center on the other, where the broken make their slow recoveries. The center lays out its cheerful furniture under the slow churn of a ceiling fan, pushing the summer's heavy air back and forth. Over in the park, children tumble through the grass, bees linger over flowers, while old folks trail their dogs, casting wary eyes at the skateboarders and nodding to the girls gathered by the playground, their talk of boys and the latest on YouTube. There’s a sushi joint in the strip mall next to the park, its food cheap, its tables rarely full. Next to it, a swimming supply store and a nail salon, a trifecta where you might attend to your pool, your nails, and your hunger all at once. The frozen yogurt shop stands there too, teenagers wandering out with sweating cups, covered in every imaginable topping, skateboarding and vaping with the air of those who think it makes them cool. This neighborhood, it's a stitch in the fabric of America, a piece of history in the drowsy South where nothing ever seems to change, not even time itself.",
            "The neighborhood stands as a testament to times bygone, its homes mostly single-family affairs, though a few have been cleaved in twain and yet remain bound, if sense can be made of such contrivance. My own dwelling sits with a small yard before it, a modest driveway to its left, akin to most others here, calling forth memories of an era when suburban life was the very heart of the American dream. A dream that once cradled the nation close but now drifts ever so slightly from our grasp. Yet these neighborhoods endure, whispering still to those who wander through them that the dream lives on, an echo of hope in a world grown indifferent. The folk here, they don't hold the hope they once did, the neatness of their lawns waning with the years. Still, cars nestle in driveways, and the children play as though the world beyond held no sway over their small lives. The public school, nearing its ninetieth year, stands as a relic and a promise, sparking futures in the young and nostalgia in the old. Churches scatter sparsely, their pews empty, but the courts ring with the sound of basketball games. Each house bears its own visage but shares a common soul. There's a supermarket named Super A, run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs in this place where most faces are African American. The streets spread wide, a field for children’s games, interrupted only by the passage of cars. Generations have rooted here, weaving stories of a time when every neighbor was known, when a karate school thrived until the allure of Hollywood's martial tales waned, leaving behind a pharmacy in its stead, for medicine, it seems, is the solace now sought. A small theater, too, clings on, offering old films to those who cherish them, the youth's disdain leaving it untroubled by crowds, a retreat for the elders who value its modest price for an evening’s respite. An expressway cuts through the town, though its access lies beyond our borders. A petition once rose to claim an exit for our place, championed by the young, yet the elders, fearing the change it might herald, swayed the council to let it pass unheeded. A new high school rises, and the question of a mascot lingers. I reckon a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin backdrop might suit this peculiar town just fine.",
            "In the sprawl of this vast city where the land stretches and bends under the weight of its own making, the neighborhood stands as a testament to the ceaseless dance of diversity. Here, the residential quarters scatter like leaves in the wind, interspersed among the bustling commerce of human enterprise. Offices rise alongside shops and eateries and places where music and laughter spill into the night air like whispers of a bygone era. There is no end to the newness of flavors and wares that tempt the wanderer’s heart. The grand emporiums of well-hewn brands stand shoulder to shoulder with the small boutiques that charm the passerby with their quaint allure. They hug the streets, threading through the city like veins, reaching into neighborhoods that might once have known the quiet of a gentle dawn but for the clamor of life that surrounds them.\n\nAnd there are parks, too. The earth there is well-trodden by the feet of young children and their guardians who seek respite under the canopy of ancient trees. The people themselves, they are a tapestry of the world. In one corner, an LGBTQ+ community thrives, while the traditions of Orthodox Jews echo through another. Refugees and immigrants from the old lands of the Soviet Union carve out their space, their stories weaving into the fabric of this place. Beyond these streets, the city unfurls into Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and the like—each its own universe, each just a stone’s throw away yet sometimes a journey of hours due to the serpentine traffic that grips the city in its iron grasp. Though the distances are not great, the time spent among the choked paths of asphalt is interminable. Feet rarely touch the ground here, for the city sprawls too wide, its veins clogged with the metal and exhaust of vehicles seeking a path through its heart.\n\nThe irony of construction rises like a specter, for in this place where space is scarce, new towers climb skyward in defiance of the crowded streets below. The city draws them in, but its residents gaze upon the growing skyline with trepidation, knowing well the burden of more souls and more machines. Yet, not all dwell within these monoliths. Homes diverse as the city itself dot the landscape: houses, small apartments, and condos, single-family dwellings beside duplexes. Even in this, there is diversity. The neighborhood breathes with lives of all ages, though the days of familiarity with those who live next door seem a distant memory. Childhood echoes with laughter in the streets, the shadows of friendships cast long ago, when the world seemed smaller and simpler. Now, it is a place of strangers, each living within their own story, the threads of which seldom intertwine.",
            "Where is everything she asked as we drove through the cornfields that stretched to the horizon like the boundless sea. This is it I said and I saw the surprise in her eyes at the vastness of it all. She came from a place where the grocery store was a short walk from her door and never had she seen such openness. The endless fields of corn rose and fell like waves and I told her of life in rural Ohio and she began to understand who I was and where I had come from. We traveled down a two-lane country road past a quarry filled with water, and beyond that lay the small development I called home. The houses were of brick and stucco, each set upon a generous half acre, and the folks there took pride in their land. Springtime brought a riot of flowers and the trees that lined the streets changed with the seasons as if to mark the passage of time. The driveways sparkled with high-end Mercedes Benz cars, gleaming under the sun after a wash. As we neared my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor was in his yard as always, with a smile on his face. He spent the days mowing his lawn, singing above the drone of his John Deere, and though he was a source of amusement to many, he was genuine and his past was rich with stories. Once a doctor, now he seemed to merge with the grass and the machine he rode. We came to my house at last. In the side yard, geese wandered and our Terrier gave chase. Behind the house, a stream fed the quarry, and there you could hear the call of bullfrogs, the murmur of water, and the distant lowing of cows from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis of trees and wildflowers, where I spent my childhood days. We built forts among the branches and chased the animals, a game we called hunting. There was always something to do, a friend to find. Winters here were harsh but held a beauty all their own. The green yard turned to a wilderness, the trees stripped bare by the cold. When snow fell, it cloaked the land in a silent wonder. My sister's snow angels dotted the ground, and snowmen stood guard. We fought as siblings do, with snowballs for weapons, and built forts of snow and branches to defend ourselves. In that snowy world, we played pretend, children without a care, lost in the magic of the moment."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Out in the heart of Rural America, in a small township of Michigan, the land stretches from the fields to the sparse tourist havens. Here, there are no sprawling malls, no Wal-mart nor Target, not even a solitary Applebee’s to mark the landscape. Every venture requires the road beneath your wheels. Yet, these lands are graced with a beauty that the world seldom knows, bordered by water, where the expanse of Lake Michigan meets with Lake Charlevoix. The very air is laced with the scent of distant waters, and beaches lie waiting for those who seek them. This neighborhood holds the spirit of the small town, where homes do not crowd upon one another but stand in their own time-worn grace. They are no mere replicas, these houses, but individual in their history and bearing. Some wear the marks of age and some the touch of renewal. Basements lie beneath them, full and visible from the roadside. The aluminum siding of old endures on many a home, and the palette of colors echoes through the blocks. Yards stretch out with trampolines and playsets, gardens and fences holding back the small lives within. It is Middle America, where folks labor for their keep, raising their families or remembering when they did. Children’s laughter spills into the streets, mingling with the sound of dogs and the whisper of wheels on pavement. Neighbors nod to neighbors, knowing who belongs and who does not. A man might stand by his grill and wave, or a passerby with a dog might offer a smile. The lawns are tended, leaves long gone with the fall, and the grass remains green and clipped. The plants and bushes, they too are kept in their place. This is no neighborhood of grandeur, but one where a life might be well lived, its quiet and peace a balm. It is average, yet within this ordinariness lies the extraordinary, a place of safety at day's end. A short walk leads to the sheriff’s office, the jail, and the health department, all settled in their places. The recycling center down the road serves the people, and beyond, the fields of play where the voices of announcers drift on the air. The small-town airport lies beyond, its engines a distant rumble. Ice cream waits at the local stand, and downtown is close enough if you’ve a mind to walk. The park is a mere eight blocks away, where children ride their bikes and laughter fills the air. Truly, it is a place worthy of calling home.",
            "In the place where I make my home, the world is carved out in neat rows and lines, a testament to the artifice of men. It bears the mark of suburban design, each house a mirror to its neighbor, each street a tale of symmetry enforced by the iron hand of the homeowner's association. As you cross the threshold into this realm, the houses stand in their sanitized glory, their facades polished by the relentless insistence of the association. The lawns are a testament to uniformity, each a small green patch bordered by stones, the driveways brief and indistinct. Now and again, a tree rises, though small and sparse, as if hesitant to break the mold.\n\nGarages yawn wide enough for two cars, and the roads, they gleam with the sheen of fresh concrete, unmarred by the wounds of time and neglect. The houses, mostly single-storied, rise occasionally to two, but never so much as to disrupt the horizon. Here, the mail does not come to the door but sits in clustered boxes at the street's end, keys the only means of entry, the HOA's creed of sameness etched into every detail.\n\nWe lie on the city's edge, straddling the line between the rural and the suburban, land stretching wide and open. Pools and paths, the bounty of community planning, invite the residents to linger, to wander without leaving the bounds of this well-tended enclave. It's a place where folks, mostly those who've seen the years pass by, find safety and solace, their lives intertwined in quiet harmony. A few younger souls pepper the landscape, professionals carving out their own paths in this ordered world.\n\nThe city beyond, vast in number but not in spirit, holds its own peculiar charm. It offers what you need and maybe more, a single mall the heart of commerce, modest in size but ample in purpose. Fifteen minutes on the road and you're met with myriad choices, from grocers of refinement to shops of austerity. Here, the neighborhood stands, a testament to safety and maintenance, a slice of the ordinary rendered in the language of man's design, where the pools reflect the sky and the trails lead you home.",
            "The first whisper of my place came to me through the ether of a podcast, a tale spun of the vanished, and it sat uneasy in the mind. Surprising it was, amid these apartments priced dearer than gold it seemed, each one a thousand dollars and more for the mere privilege of sleep. No recollection of such stories had ever crossed my ears, nor those of my friends. Perhaps it was the struggle that bound us, those nights when tears fell unbidden from eyes accustomed to the hard truths of frugality. The years had taught us a sharpness, a way to find solace in the scent of toys long forgotten and clothes buried in mothballs. The smells of adulthood, they fade and blur, smoking out the edges of memory until only dust and time remain. Flea markets, they always break through, their scent of age and life insistent like old magazines piled high upon a forgotten piano. The dust settles deep into leather, a stubborn guest refusing eviction. \n\nHere the thrifts are three, each within steps of the other, a pilgrimage of sorts. A walk that takes you through charity’s embrace, the whisper of books long out of print, and the oddities of a curio shop. Downtown swells with the tide of cars and people, a river of life that flows unceasingly, yet within the thrifts, silence reigns. The world outside may clamor, but here the quiet holds sway, a sanctuary for the lost hours of an afternoon. \n\nEvery year the city swells, its arteries clogged with the pulse of progress, this place they say is burgeoning, clutching at the hems of a digital empire vast and sprawling. It brings to mind the old city, New York, where the multitudes pursue their solitary purposes and ask little from you save to leave them be. Here, anonymity is a right, an unspoken pact. Unlike the South, where concern weaves through the fabric of civility, here the shell is yours to keep, the city indifferent as the tide, crashing and receding against the shore of your solitude. \n\nYet for all its modern sprawl, life persists in the spaces between. A pianist next door, voices raised in song from above, a symphony of life in the midst of concrete. It’s less an apartment of strangers, more a tapestry of lives intertwined. We gather, we celebrate, we mourn, we help. In this, luck finds me, wrapped in the kindness of neighbors who reach out as I do in return. We share the small acts of living, the mail, the meals, the presence that reassures. It is they who remind me that in this vast expanse of steel and stone, I have not lost myself entirely.",
            "I dwell in a modest town laid upon the plains of the Midwest, just beyond the reach of a sprawling city. On the eastern fringe of this town lies my neighborhood, a place where the weight of economic hardship settles like dust. The houses here stand as humble sentinels, their worth measured in the currency of struggle, owned or rented by souls who bear the burden of scant means. Yet, it is not a place stripped of beauty or bereft of spirit. Walk the streets and you'll find faces turned to you in greeting, a community bound by the thin thread of shared existence. Crime does cast its shadow, darker here than other quarters, but still it is a shadow not yet monstrous. In the past decade, violence has visited these streets, leaving behind echoes of gunfire and the cold silence of loss. Our neighbors next door, their son claimed by a bullet outside a dim-lit bar just last year. By grace or fortune, our family has been spared such direct sorrow, save for the petty theft of forgotten items on our porch. The town bears the scars of a wider plague, the scourge of opioids that has swept across this land. Lives have been claimed by the insidious grip of fentanyl, but in this place, there is a flicker of resistance. Resources stand ready, addiction centers and Narcan trainings offering a lifeline to those teetering on the edge. Despite the shadows, this town holds its virtues. My son's elementary school, a beacon of hope, staffed by those who nurture with compassion. Even with his special needs, he finds no torment here, only acceptance in an atmosphere charged with positivity. The PTO, ever industrious, orchestrates gatherings to weave families into the fabric of education. Hunger finds no purchase here, with meals freely given to all, a testament to the town's refusal to let poverty strip dignity from its children. The City Council, in its wisdom, has sought to polish the face of our town, roads renewed and parks reborn, though these efforts lean westward, leaving our side of town to languish. This neglect breeds discontent among us who dwell in its shadow. Yet, I find contentment in this place. The people, warm and genuine, the schools a nurturing ground, and the shops, both quaint and grand, suffice for our needs. Our home, though modest in worth, cradles us in comfort. Sixteen years we have called this place ours, and the thought of elsewhere is but a whisper in the wind.",
            "In the hills where my home lies, there's a tapestry of the past woven into every corner. The neighborhood sits upon a rise, and its structures speak in whispers of the old world. Seven stories tall, my apartment stands across from a theater that once breathed life, and down the slope rests a curious arcade bar, drawing a medley of souls when the summer's breath is warm. On weekends in the heart of June and July, a line snakes out, folk eager for the revelry within. Nearby, the city park sprawls, its breadth surprising for its place among the urban sprawl. Encircling it is the gray of concrete, steps molded into its face. Winter comes with a bite, and the unsheltered erect their camps in orderly rows along those steps, the chill biting but less so for the closeness. The rain falls more than snow, and in those torrents of midwinter, warmth is a fugitive thing. But the heart of the city is nearer than the wilderness, and the sanctuary of a family center beckons, offering a place to wash away the grime.\n\nYet it is not the beauty of architecture or the proud history that holds me. It is the spirit of the people that binds me to this place. Hilltop, once a name spoken in fear, known for blood and violence on the western shores. The tales linger, ghostly echoes of federal forces sweeping through like a storm to cleanse the streets. Memories persist, passed down like heirlooms, even to newcomers like me. The labor of the people is unending, their hands worn from striving to transform what was once notorious. They hold a fierce pride, a vigilance over their domain. Whispers caution the pale-skinned to tread lightly after dusk, a relic of bygone days, stained with the bitterness of old prejudices. Perhaps my complexion shields me, or perhaps Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, a witness to the scars that mar our land. Scars of bigotry, of ingrained fear and ignorance, even in a city that fancies itself a mosaic of cultures. But in my heart, I know: the Hilltop is my anchor. In the night, I walk those streets, alive and unafraid, met with kindness more often than malice. A place of small mercies, where doors stay open a moment longer for refuge from the storm. Where strangers pause, see me in my solitude, and offer a word of grace, a reminder of worth amidst the gloom.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world seemed vast and unyielding. At first, friends were hard to come by, but soon enough, I found kinship with a boy two doors down and another who lived along the same stretch of road. They've both moved on, but the echoes of our shared days linger, like whispers caught in the wind. Most of the folks who were here when I first arrived have stayed, their lives threading through the fabric of this place like the steady ticking of a clock. This neighborhood is much like any American suburb, with its rows of two-story houses standing sentinel under the wide sky. \n\nOn weekends, or whenever the sun graces us with its warmth, the laughter of children rises up, a bright chorus against the quietude that fills the weekdays. Here, folks leave you be unless need calls them to your side. Not once has a package vanished from my porch. There's a trust among us that feels as solid as the earth beneath our feet. Just down the way, a park beckons, a mere minute's walk from my door. It's a place heavy with memories, of games played and friendships forged. There, too, is the memory of a football game that left me with a bloodied nose, a sharp reminder amid the softer recollections. Now, the park is a playground for my cousin's young ones, their delight in swings and slides a testament to the simple joys that endure. \n\nThe park draws from me a deep nostalgia, a longing for days past. This neighborhood is a tapestry of cultures, with flavors from Chinese to Indian, Mexican to Italian, all within a stone's throw. Yet, the ease of modern life has many turning to the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash, though fast food reigns supreme as it does in most suburban sprawls. Pizza joints abound, each with its own claim to fame. The stores here cater to every need, from dry cleaners to the familiar glow of Walgreens and CVS. Jewel-Osco stands as a beacon of Midwestern commerce. Among the stores, an Indian-owned shop offers the spices and flavors of home for those who seek it.\n\nI've grown fond of this place. The tales of discord and strife in other neighborhoods, shared across the digital ether, only deepen my gratitude for the peace I find among these quiet streets.",
            "The college stands not far from my dwelling and for this I take comfort in its proximity, the neighborhood a tapestry of apartment blocks and the odd establishment where one might find diversion or drink without ruinous expense. A bar has changed its name and with it the price of entry, though the quality holds its own. The folk here are of two sorts, students mostly or those of modest means, the rent a mercy to the latter. Children abound, drawn by the nearby elementary, their laughter a constant chorus beneath the trees that crowd the grounds of my abode. I know not the people who share these walls, nor do I wish to. Their smoke seeps through the halls and in response the management has mounted a contraption to mask the scent, a gesture both absurd and amusing to my companion and me. The buildings stand with age upon them, their facades weary though the interiors may surprise. Down the way rise new edifices, but they are no better for their youth, hastily erected and demanding a sum none should pay. There is a place to eat where the fare comes on paper and the microwave hums in the kitchen, the opposite a gas station where work is not for the faint of heart. The city saw fit to mend the road, laying down a path wide enough for two abreast and soft with grass at its edges. Yet the place I call home is cloaked in trees, their numbers diminished but still they stand sentinel. Behind, another street runs parallel, though it shows a rougher face, the walkways crumbling and the edifices in disrepair. Trees here serve as a shield, their shade covering the flaws. Crime has made its mark, more on the street behind than here, yet it is not an isolated blight. Across the way lies a haunt of transient souls and troubles aplenty. Still, I find a liking for my corner of the world. It is within my means and serviceable, the university a short stroll and the buses waiting to ferry me to the heart of the town or the market as needed.",
            "The neighborhood lay at the end of a cul-de-sac, a clutch of duplexes painted all the same yellow with white porches and green metal roofs, set down among fields and trees like a small village lost in time. There was a sense of kinship among those who lived here, neighbors gathering in the evenings at the edge of someone’s driveway, watching children with their kites and chalk, as if the world outside had ceased its relentless pace. The sky stretched overhead, blue and vast, the clouds a billowing white. Yet even here the world could not be kept at bay. Tornado warnings had scattered the tranquility, the sirens calling out in the night like some ancient lament. I found myself curled in the bathtub with my smallest dog, clutching purse and pillows as the hail battered the earth outside. My larger dog refused the sanctuary, pacing the living room with nervous barks. The aftermath left the roads steaming, the temperature falling from sweltering to cool in the span of moments. As the clouds parted, the sun spilled through and a double rainbow arched across the sky. I fetched my camera, capturing the moment to share with those far away. The neighborhood held its breath a while longer before life returned to its habitual rhythms, mothers calling children to dinner, the air filled with the scent of cooking. \n\nFor one who has recently moved from the granite hills of New Hampshire to this North Carolina hamlet, the southern drawl is a song unto itself. The homes are outwardly identical, two bedrooms and two baths, yet within them, they differ. Some are small to the point of puzzlement. I wander the field behind my home, path leading to a pond where deer sometimes gather and in the morning the bullfrog sings his deep song. It is a place removed, yet close enough to Charlotte that the city’s reach is felt. Each day begins with the crow of roosters from surrounding farms, the evenings echo with the bray of a donkey from a nearby farm. It is a strange grace to have stumbled upon such a haven.",
            "In the long expanse of time, ten years seems a blink, yet here I am with the dust settled upon the memories of my coming. There was a sadness when I first set foot in this place, a melancholy that clung like the morning fog. From Riverdale to Stockbridge, I journeyed, and tears were my companion, for I left behind the familiar, the beloved. My parents, seeking what was best for me and my sister, led us to this new land, a place of promise and opportunity, far removed from the shadows of our past.\n\nIn the early days, the streets were strange and unyielding, but as the years folded into one another, I found my footing. New friends emerged from the shadows, and with them, new foes. The neighbors were distant, save for Mr. Glen and his brood, and Dennis who dwelled close by. Their kindness was a balm in the wilderness, and I came to hold them dear, like kin. I recall with clarity the day we attended Mr. Glen's wedding anew, a celebration that spoke of hope and renewal. There was joy in the air, and laughter danced in the night as I caught the white garter Ms. Veda tossed. But the flowers eluded me.\n\nThe neighborhood is a labyrinth, its paths winding and secretive, though a GPS now guides my wanderings. My explorations were often shared with Kason and Curtis, comrades in the simple pleasures of youth. Together, we delved into the world of video games and the unhurried joy of existence. The park offered solace, a place where nature whispered calm into my restless soul. There, I practiced balance with sticks from the depot, my wooden sword a companion in the dance of solitude.\n\nCourts of basketball and tennis stood silent, relics of a past when my father and Mr. Graves taught us the game of tennis. The memory of their lessons still echoes, a testament to the sweat and laughter shared. Fun was never in short supply in this place, and though many tales could be told, these are the ones that linger. Yet, I hold a quiet belief that the finest days remain ahead, waiting to unfurl their stories.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town like so many others, yet it calls itself the Peach Capital of the World. Johnston, with its fields rolling out under endless skies, holds its secrets in the soil and the trees heavy with fruit. On the sign that welcomes you, this boast is etched, though the town speaks softly in its quiet way. Here, the earth is parceled into farms where peach trees stand sentinel or cattle graze in languid contemplation. Homes stand apart, two-storied and roofed in metal or shingle, set back from the roads, yielding the front fields to the sun and the rain and the toil of men.\n\nIn the town's heart, a solitary stoplight hangs over a crossroads, casting its red and green eyes upon the few places folks gather. Hong Kong, with its modest offerings from a far land, and Fiesta Mexican, where the air is spiced with distant flavors, and Gary's, a burger chain that spins tales of America on its sizzling grills. Once, a pizzeria served its own kind of alchemy, but its ovens are now cold.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug, whose fame rests not on its prescriptions but on the sweet bite of Cherry Coca-Cola, stands alongside the Independent Grocers Alliance, a store known more by its letters, IGA. Though sole in its kind, it sees its patrons more for trifles than for the feast of groceries, who journey instead to Batesburg-Leesville for the abundance of Walmart. Dollar General holds the town's affections, its aisles a march of necessity from dawn till dusk.\n\nIn the corner of this world, Possibilities Furniture & More stands, its keeper a woman whose kindness maps the town. Movers ply their trade under her employ, delivering the promise of comfort to waiting homes. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels caters to creatures both great and small, offering care and respite.\n\nThe doctor and the vet, each with their small practice, tend to the body and soul of Johnston's creatures. And the young ones learn their letters at Johnston Elementary, until the world calls them to the neighboring town's schools. Parks there are none, but plans are laid for a patch of green where families might gather under the open sky.\n\nFor all its lacks, Johnston holds its charm in its simplicity. A town so small and unassuming, you might pass it by and not know it, a whisper on the wind as you journey on.",
            "In the heart of a small Tennessee town, where the lands stretch out in quiet repose, I find my home nestled in the suburb's embrace, a place where time moves in its own unhurried measure. The street that ties our lives together winds between two state highways, and though the passage of cars is more frequent than my liking, the neighborhood holds its peace like a well-kept secret. The faces here have become familiar, for few come or go, and in their constancy, I find a comfort like the sun's daily return. The people tend to their yards and the small labors of life that stitch the hours together. Winter comes and we take to sledding down the hill, a brief and joyful flight on our side street. Our house stands on the corner, a sentinel watching the comings and goings, and in this way, we know each car and each journey by heart. When a foreign vehicle appears, it is marked by our eyes, as if the land itself notes the intrusion. Neighbors wander the roads, some for the exercise, some led by the leashes of their dogs. Children, with the abandon of youth, weave their bicycles through the air. We remain home more often than not, our work tethered to the house. There are four souls here: myself, my wife, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen, growing up in this quiet corner of the world. Our presence is known, just as we know theirs. We play outside, even under the rain's gentle insistence. At times, the back deck becomes an altar to the grill, smoke and scent mingling with the air—a promise of warmth and gathering. The drone of lawnmowers is a constant from March to October, a soundtrack to the growing season. Trees abound, remnants of the woods that once held sway, offering shade in summer and a burden of leaves in the fall, demanding the rake and the fire. I savor the scent of burning leaves, the autumn's signature, though winter comes now as a pale shadow of itself, leaving us with an endless fall. The garage at the back of the house serves as my retreat, a place for the truck and other endeavors, and when the doors swing open, I feel the pulse of the neighborhood beat stronger in my veins. Holidays descend with a gentle hush, Thanksgiving's arrival marked by unfamiliar cars crowding the streets as families reunite. Mother’s Day and Christmas bring the same quiet flurry. In all its simplicity, I find I am content here. Were it not for the road that carries strangers through our midst, it would be a perfect place indeed.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where dust and grit lay claim to the earth, my neighborhood sprawls beneath an endless sky. The land here is a tapestry of brown, a harsh and unyielding hue that stretches as far as the eye can see. Only those who've set foot in this place can truly understand the relentless presence of the earth's bare bones. When a patch of green appears, it is a testament to toil and expense, a small rebellion against the desert's dominion. Back in the nineties, the homes were scattered like seeds cast upon the wind, and though the land remains much the same, new structures rise like sentinels of change. The city creeps ever closer, its edges blurring into the desert's vastness, as if it were a living thing, always growing, always hungry. \n\nIn this place, the people are warm and welcoming, but like any city, shadows linger where the sun does not reach. My own corner of this world is watched over by gentle souls, the elders who have seen the sands shift and change. The stores that dot our streets bear familiar names, chains that have planted their roots in this arid soil. For a taste of the finer things, a journey must be made, for here, the likes of Whole Foods are but whispers on the wind. \n\nConstruction reigns as the king of industry, driven by the unquenched thirst for development. The open spaces call to the builders, urging them to transform the desert's face. It is a prospect that fills me with unease; the city I left behind whispers its siren song, and I find no desire to return. My hands find their purpose in the craft of drywall and T-bar, shaping the spaces where others will dwell.\n\nYet amid the encroaching change, the desert offers its own treasures. The creatures that call this harsh land home are a wonder to behold. My children, wild with the joy of discovery, chase lizards and bugs beneath the sun's watchful gaze. The high desert holds its secrets close, a beauty both stark and fragile.\n\nVictorville, with its peculiar charms, offers a taste of the desert's mystery. The San Bernardino County Fair casts its spell each year, a celebration of life beneath the endless sky. Nearby, Wrightwood beckons with its snow-capped peaks, a place where winter's breath can be felt. For those with a thirst for knowledge, the Victor Valley Museum stands as a guardian of stories, its halls echoing with the whispers of the past. Here, the land’s history and culture are laid bare, a testament to the resilience and spirit of this desert world.",
            "The world turns and the sun climbs over the horizon with a light that is ancient and indifferent. When asked to speak of my neighborhood, I reckon my tale might stray from the usual. Others, they might talk of homes with picket fences and the slow pulse of suburban life. My place is different. My neighborhood is a college campus, a sprawl of brick and mortar where the young and the searching gather in dormitories and lecture halls. This is my community, my tribe. The land around it, the campus, it too is my neighborhood, though a bit less so.\n\nIn its essence, my neighborhood is a reflection of the larger world. It has its dwellings, its people, its commerce, and its patches of green where one might find solace. Let me take you through these places. The \"houses\" here, they are of a kind distinct to this place. We have three sorts: the apartments, the houses, and the dormitories. In the apartments, rooms hold two to four souls, and floors stack upon floors, with twenty or so folks in a building. The houses, they stand apart, open to those bound to the school in some way or another. They are few, these houses, a rarity for those from days gone by. But the dormitories, they are the heart. Hundreds of students, each room a shared space, a common kind of living here.\n\nNow, about the people. The school takes pride in the tapestry of its folk. They come from lands far and near, of all ages and stories. The staff, they dwell in the houses, while the new blood fills the dorms, and the older ones find their place in the apartments. Words fall short in capturing their essence. Best to move on to the commerce and the green spaces of my neighborhood.\n\nThis school, it is a world unto itself. Stores line its paths, with food and wares like any town, but also goods marked by the school’s own hand. All that one could need lies within its bounds. And the park, a small oasis, a place where the diverse gather under the open sky. It is kept clean, a testament to the care of the community. This is my neighborhood, and here, all things find their place.",
            "There are no sidewalks where I live. The land slopes ever downward and my house clings to the summit of the hill, the steepest in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill. The joggers ascend its face each morning, their breath mingling with the fog. The street is without sidewalks and the folk must tread upon the asphalt, pitted and worn, a hazard to both foot and wheel. The wires that net the sky above are frayed and ragged, victims of the storms that rage through this place. The branches and debris strike them down and they rise again patched and piecemeal, a testament to resilience. Tall evergreens stand sentinel all around, their presence loathed by those who yearn for the sea’s expanse. They cut them down, these trees, to clear the path for the eye, to let the ocean’s horizon pour into their glass-fronted homes which rise like sentinels along the hill. At sunset the bay ignites with an inner fire and the sky bleeds orange, though more often the sun hides behind a veil of cloud. The days are gray and wet. Moss creeps where it will, a green shroud upon roofs and cars and railings. I left my car outside once and it grew a pelt of moss in a month’s time. Spent three hours scraping it clean. Children are scarce here though there’s a school just yonder. The old ones dwell in these parts, their days spent in quietude. Dogs abound in place of children, lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leave a door ajar and they’ll find their way inside. I found one in my living room once, had to shoo it out. Rabbits roam as well, their numbers thinned by the relentless hunt of the neighborhood’s cats. The gardeners curse them for the burrows they dig, the roots they sunder. Birds flit about, sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle driven off by crows. There are no stores here, but down the slope by the water’s edge lie a few eateries where the catch of the day is served. The beach is but a stony shore, yet the rocks invite the hand to cast them into the bay. The water stretches not far, the opposite shore plainly visible even through the mist’s embrace.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, there lies a place called Bensonhurst. It is not difficult to find. The public conveyances of New York City will bear you there without fail, for they are many and ceaseless in their comings and goings. Bensonhurst is a place of streets and corners, a place where the city breathes and moves with the rhythm of its own making. As you walk among its lanes, know that you have not left New York City, for it lingers in the very air you breathe.\n\nIn these parts, over the span of two decades, there has been a gathering of peoples from distant shores, and their presence is marked by the shops they have wrought. Each block is testament to their industry—a myriad of Asian-owned establishments, from supermarkets to laundromats, their signs calling out in colors and scripts foreign and familiar. The wares they offer are lauded by those who dwell here, for the quality is high and the price is not dear, and such convenience is a balm to the weary soul.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not solely of one people. It is a tapestry woven of many threads, immigrants and their children who have taken root in this soil. The businesses that rise and fall in this place are largely Asian-owned, but the people who walk these streets are of all kinds. There is even a park nearby, freshly tended and made anew, where children play and men engage in their games, where the fountains sing of summer, and all manner of folk mingle in the soft light of the evening.\n\nThe skyline is not marred by the towers of commerce, for here the structures are more humble: apartments and houses, places where families find their rest. The air is filled with noise, a cacophony of engines and music, a symphony that plays from dawn till dusk, and it is the song of the city itself.\n\nWhen night falls, carry with you a measure of caution, for though the streets are not perilous, the unknown lurks in the shadows. There are those who would trouble you for their own sport, and there are thieves who covet what is not theirs. I have known the sting of such encounters, though years have passed since then. And there are those who disregard the laws of cleanliness, leaving behind the leavings of their dogs for the unwary to tread upon. It is a trial to keep one's shoes unsoiled in such a place.\n\nSo if you come to Bensonhurst, come with eyes open and feet wary, for the city is a place of many wonders and many trials, and it is a place that will mark you as surely as you mark it.",
            "The first thing you must understand about Portland, Oregon is the nature of its strangeness. Upon the brick facade of a building that dabbles as a pizza parlor, a bar, a music hall, and a den of dubious repute, there is scrawled the town's unofficial creed: \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a faint echo of the Portland from the days gone by, a whisper of the city in the nineties and early aughts when it was less charted and less dear, a cradle for peculiar and vibrant subcultures. For others, it is an invitation - come to Portland, where they will call you strange, but with affection. Despite the tide of wealthy Californians and the rising sprawl of condominiums to house them, Portland remains strange. Strange does not mean unconditionally accepting, but it means embracing what the world often shuns. Strange does not imply a lack of modernity or its battles. Like the rest of the nation, we barter for most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be strange, to diverge from the ordinary, yet Portland holds its share of the mundane. We have yoga and hipsters and the suited professionals. Perhaps strange means we simply bear all this with less gravity. In my neighborhood, as in many of Portland's enclaves, we have houses painted in hues of whimsy, gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the curbs, and in the summer, boxes of giveaways. These free boxes, usually cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold the castaways of another, yet often something magical, a treasure awaiting the wanderer. They mostly contain clothes and books but can surprise with anything. The enchantment of meandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is the essence of what Portland means to me, though I am but one thread in a tapestry of peculiarity. Some folks I share this city with would never deign to pluck their garments from a roadside box. They find solace in goat yoga or at the Timbers’ roar. Portland brims with souls who love all manner of things. Portland is a city of dreamers, whether chasing those dreams or dreaming of chasing them while the nights slip away at the bar. Yes, there is a shadow of addiction here. Such shadows often cast their roots in the soil of mental unrest, and the unending rain and brooding skies seem to play their part. Portland grapples with homelessness as well, a plight without easy remedy. The homeless are drawn by what services the city can muster, services that outshine much of the nation, yet fall short as they do everywhere. The housed waver between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not strange at all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. In the north, they bear witness to the sun’s pilgrimage across the heavens at dawn and dusk. No matter how the world forgets them or how the tides of toil and life may pull me away, they remain, unyielding, untouched by the fleeting woes of men. On days when the weight of the world bears down upon me, they call out for my gaze, and as I turn to them, they offer solace to my restless spirit, lending me strength to press forward, one day at a time. It was when I first came here for my studies that I found my eyes drawn to the northern peaks that watched over the campus. True, the university boasts its own share of splendor in its edifices and waters and groves, which hold a part of my affection, but it is the mountains that reign supreme in my heart. The town itself is lovely in its way. There are countless cafés where hours of caffeine-driven study took place. One might walk or take the bus a short distance to the downtown, where the air hangs heavy with the past, in the faded bricks of eateries and offices. Here, this seeming suburb stirs with as much life and vigor as the nearby city. Yet, this bustle is but a brief affair, for one might slip away again into the quietude of the town with a mere pass by the library. This close juxtaposition of worlds lends the city a certain enchantment, inviting exploration. Thus, it is simple to weave many a fond memory, each tied to a corner of the town. Whether it be strolling past rusted swings in the park with friends after a night unended or racing through the vibrant downtown to catch a film at the grand theater courtesy of university tickets. But it is also a place of bitter recollections, as all locales inevitably are in the weave of life. The ponds, especially, serve as mirrors for contemplation and the occasional tearful vigil at two in the morning amid an existential storm. The latter, I know too well. As I watched the turtles and ducks and insects live their tiny dramas, each with a part to play, I pondered my own purpose as I navigated the enigma of existence. So I walked past the pond and the park and the little houses that spoke of suburbia until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun cast its golden light upon the palms, painting the sky, and as I lifted my gaze to the dawn, I knew I was walking north. And sure enough, they were there, as they had ever been. The steadfast mountains touched the hazy blue and yellow sky more surely than any structure on the horizon, and as if through a silent language, they stirred within me a resolve to endure.",
            "In the first glance it might be a place you'd pass by unseeing. It's just a residential block tucked behind the strip of stores, not the kind of place one thinks of people making their homes. Yet homes they are. You head past the vacant Whole Foods, past the hotels that see life only in brief summer flares for family gatherings, and there you find the stirrings of a community. The streets hold the apartments, each one laid out in a deliberate line like dolls from a wooden set, each one taken apart and laid side by side, piecemeal. The first you see are the ones that have found their names in the news, unsavory tales that cast long shadows, but we won't linger there. For beyond them, the other complexes open into a world unknown to the wider town. Across, a community college's satellite campus stands with quiet dignity, its structures calm in their vigil by the roadside. The students come in their morning stupor, clutching coffees, yawning their way through the iron gates that open with a groan, while the commuters curse and moan, held back in the rush of a crowded morning. Where the road meets another, it finds a park on one edge and a rehab center on the other, where the broken make their slow recoveries. The center lays out its cheerful furniture under the slow churn of a ceiling fan, pushing the summer's heavy air back and forth. Over in the park, children tumble through the grass, bees linger over flowers, while old folks trail their dogs, casting wary eyes at the skateboarders and nodding to the girls gathered by the playground, their talk of boys and the latest on YouTube. There’s a sushi joint in the strip mall next to the park, its food cheap, its tables rarely full. Next to it, a swimming supply store and a nail salon, a trifecta where you might attend to your pool, your nails, and your hunger all at once. The frozen yogurt shop stands there too, teenagers wandering out with sweating cups, covered in every imaginable topping, skateboarding and vaping with the air of those who think it makes them cool. This neighborhood, it's a stitch in the fabric of America, a piece of history in the drowsy South where nothing ever seems to change, not even time itself.",
            "The neighborhood stands as a testament to times bygone, its homes mostly single-family affairs, though a few have been cleaved in twain and yet remain bound, if sense can be made of such contrivance. My own dwelling sits with a small yard before it, a modest driveway to its left, akin to most others here, calling forth memories of an era when suburban life was the very heart of the American dream. A dream that once cradled the nation close but now drifts ever so slightly from our grasp. Yet these neighborhoods endure, whispering still to those who wander through them that the dream lives on, an echo of hope in a world grown indifferent. The folk here, they don't hold the hope they once did, the neatness of their lawns waning with the years. Still, cars nestle in driveways, and the children play as though the world beyond held no sway over their small lives. The public school, nearing its ninetieth year, stands as a relic and a promise, sparking futures in the young and nostalgia in the old. Churches scatter sparsely, their pews empty, but the courts ring with the sound of basketball games. Each house bears its own visage but shares a common soul. There's a supermarket named Super A, run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs in this place where most faces are African American. The streets spread wide, a field for children’s games, interrupted only by the passage of cars. Generations have rooted here, weaving stories of a time when every neighbor was known, when a karate school thrived until the allure of Hollywood's martial tales waned, leaving behind a pharmacy in its stead, for medicine, it seems, is the solace now sought. A small theater, too, clings on, offering old films to those who cherish them, the youth's disdain leaving it untroubled by crowds, a retreat for the elders who value its modest price for an evening’s respite. An expressway cuts through the town, though its access lies beyond our borders. A petition once rose to claim an exit for our place, championed by the young, yet the elders, fearing the change it might herald, swayed the council to let it pass unheeded. A new high school rises, and the question of a mascot lingers. I reckon a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin backdrop might suit this peculiar town just fine.",
            "In the sprawl of this vast city where the land stretches and bends under the weight of its own making, the neighborhood stands as a testament to the ceaseless dance of diversity. Here, the residential quarters scatter like leaves in the wind, interspersed among the bustling commerce of human enterprise. Offices rise alongside shops and eateries and places where music and laughter spill into the night air like whispers of a bygone era. There is no end to the newness of flavors and wares that tempt the wanderer’s heart. The grand emporiums of well-hewn brands stand shoulder to shoulder with the small boutiques that charm the passerby with their quaint allure. They hug the streets, threading through the city like veins, reaching into neighborhoods that might once have known the quiet of a gentle dawn but for the clamor of life that surrounds them.\n\nAnd there are parks, too. The earth there is well-trodden by the feet of young children and their guardians who seek respite under the canopy of ancient trees. The people themselves, they are a tapestry of the world. In one corner, an LGBTQ+ community thrives, while the traditions of Orthodox Jews echo through another. Refugees and immigrants from the old lands of the Soviet Union carve out their space, their stories weaving into the fabric of this place. Beyond these streets, the city unfurls into Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and the like—each its own universe, each just a stone’s throw away yet sometimes a journey of hours due to the serpentine traffic that grips the city in its iron grasp. Though the distances are not great, the time spent among the choked paths of asphalt is interminable. Feet rarely touch the ground here, for the city sprawls too wide, its veins clogged with the metal and exhaust of vehicles seeking a path through its heart.\n\nThe irony of construction rises like a specter, for in this place where space is scarce, new towers climb skyward in defiance of the crowded streets below. The city draws them in, but its residents gaze upon the growing skyline with trepidation, knowing well the burden of more souls and more machines. Yet, not all dwell within these monoliths. Homes diverse as the city itself dot the landscape: houses, small apartments, and condos, single-family dwellings beside duplexes. Even in this, there is diversity. The neighborhood breathes with lives of all ages, though the days of familiarity with those who live next door seem a distant memory. Childhood echoes with laughter in the streets, the shadows of friendships cast long ago, when the world seemed smaller and simpler. Now, it is a place of strangers, each living within their own story, the threads of which seldom intertwine.",
            "Where is everything she asked as we drove through the cornfields that stretched to the horizon like the boundless sea. This is it I said and I saw the surprise in her eyes at the vastness of it all. She came from a place where the grocery store was a short walk from her door and never had she seen such openness. The endless fields of corn rose and fell like waves and I told her of life in rural Ohio and she began to understand who I was and where I had come from. We traveled down a two-lane country road past a quarry filled with water, and beyond that lay the small development I called home. The houses were of brick and stucco, each set upon a generous half acre, and the folks there took pride in their land. Springtime brought a riot of flowers and the trees that lined the streets changed with the seasons as if to mark the passage of time. The driveways sparkled with high-end Mercedes Benz cars, gleaming under the sun after a wash. As we neared my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor was in his yard as always, with a smile on his face. He spent the days mowing his lawn, singing above the drone of his John Deere, and though he was a source of amusement to many, he was genuine and his past was rich with stories. Once a doctor, now he seemed to merge with the grass and the machine he rode. We came to my house at last. In the side yard, geese wandered and our Terrier gave chase. Behind the house, a stream fed the quarry, and there you could hear the call of bullfrogs, the murmur of water, and the distant lowing of cows from nearby farms. Across a handmade wooden bridge lay an untouched oasis of trees and wildflowers, where I spent my childhood days. We built forts among the branches and chased the animals, a game we called hunting. There was always something to do, a friend to find. Winters here were harsh but held a beauty all their own. The green yard turned to a wilderness, the trees stripped bare by the cold. When snow fell, it cloaked the land in a silent wonder. My sister's snow angels dotted the ground, and snowmen stood guard. We fought as siblings do, with snowballs for weapons, and built forts of snow and branches to defend ourselves. In that snowy world, we played pretend, children without a care, lost in the magic of the moment."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies a small town in Michigan, where the road stretches from vast farmlands to quaint tourist cities. It is a place devoid of sprawling malls or the bright lights of Wal-mart, Target, or even the humble glow of an Applebee’s. Here, the open land demands you drive to your destination, yet it is a place of untouched beauty, wrapped in the embrace of water. My town, if you can call it that, finds itself nestled between the grand expanse of Lake Michigan and the serene waters of Lake Charlevoix. Shores stretch out, inviting the weary to rest their feet in the cool embrace of the sand and surf.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks in the quiet tongue of small-town life. Houses stand apart, not the uniformity of modernity but relics of a bygone era, some tended to with care, others left to the ravages of time. Full basements peer from beneath the ground along the streets, and aluminum siding glints under the sun. The spectrum of home colors paints the blocks in a myriad of hues, each with a yard where children’s laughter echoes from trampolines and playsets. Gardens grow in the care of those who tend to them, fences keep the animals safe. It is the visage of Middle America, where laboring hands strive to carve out a living, nurturing the young or reflecting on the past.\n\nIn this place, the streets are alive with the patter of children’s feet, the bark of a dog, the hum of bicycles and rollerblades. Neighbors nod in recognition, a silent understanding of who belongs. A grill sends up smoke as a friendly wave passes between strangers, a smile exchanged from afar. Lawns are kept neat, leaves banished, the grass a verdant carpet beneath the feet. It may not be a neighborhood that inspires awe, but it is a sanctuary, a haven for families to grow and find their peace. The quiet speaks volumes; it is a place of safety, a refuge at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s department stands watch, the health department its neighbor, and the recycling center serves the community’s needs. The crack of bat against ball echoes from fields where children play, their names called out by unseen voices. And the small town airport, where the roar of engines shatters the silence, planes climbing into the open sky. Ice cream waits within walking distance, a sweet reward for those who venture downtown. Eight blocks away, the park welcomes my children’s bikes. It is a place of simple joys and unassuming grace, a good place to call home.",
            "In the land where the houses stand in neat rows like sentinels of some forgotten order, there lies the neighborhood that wears the face of the commonplace. A suburbia wrought by the hand of uniformity, sculpted under the stern eye of the homeowner's association. Upon entry, you are greeted by the unyielding symmetry of manicured lawns and homes that whisper the same secrets, each with a patch of green, some stones scattered like the memories of lost landscapes, and driveways that stretch briefly from street to home. The trees, sparse and deliberate, stand as if planted by some ancient decree. Each domicile boasts a garage for two, a testament to the lives within.\n\nAs you traverse this place, the roads, smooth as a river's stone, bear no blemish nor scar. The asphalt, unmarked by time's passage, speaks of a relentless upkeep that defies the entropy of the world beyond. The houses, mostly of a single story, rise occasionally to two, breaking the horizon like the quiet rise of a thought unspoken. Mailboxes do not stand solitary at the curb but gather at the street's end in a cluster, a congregation of metal that demands a key for entry, parcels held in lockers as if secrets kept by the community itself.\n\nThe boundary of this neighborhood lies at the edge of the city's reach, a place where the rural and the suburban converge, giving rise to expanses of land that invite the wanderer to walk its paths. Pools, gated and pristine, lie in wait for those who seek solace in their waters. Trails wind through the community, offering the promise of solitude or the company of a faithful hound at one's side. Here, exercise needs no park, for the neighborhood is vast enough to hold your running feet.\n\nThe souls who dwell here are mostly those who have seen the seasons turn many times, retirees who watch over one another with a quiet vigilance. Yet, among them, the young professionals and the middle-aged find their place, adding their stories to the tapestry of life here. The city nearby, a paradox of size and intimacy, offers its bounty of amenities. A single mall stands as the heart of commerce, modest in size but sufficient to the needs of those who seek its wares. Fifteen minutes by car will take you to any place of note, where high-end grocers share space with outlets of frugality, each with their own tale to tell.\n\nAnd so this place, safe and tended with care, holds within it the trappings of a familiar life. The pools and trails, the order and the quiet, all speak of a world crafted for comfort. Though the shopping lies a journey away, it is but a small price for the peace this land bestows.",
            "The first I’d heard of the place was listening to some broadcast about lost souls. It caught me off guard, unexpected like. Every flat around here runs up past a thousand a month and nobody ever spoke of such tales, not to me or any of the folks I knew. Maybe it’s the struggle. I know some who cry themselves to sleep, though they won’t say it. The cost of things bears down hard but we’ve learned to scrape by. You come to embrace the scent of old toys and clothes kept from the moths. You find yourself smelling less as the years weigh in. Maybe you take up smoking or maybe you just grow used to the way of things. But the flea market stands its ground. The odor of grown days is dusty stacks of magazines on a silent piano. It settles in the leather and stays there even after washing. Around here, three thrift stores lie within strolling distance. Start on the far side and you’ll see two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book shop, and a curio store. Downtown’s tight with cars and bodies, filling the streets at dawn, but you’d never hear them in the thrifts. No matter the passing crowd or traffic, the place holds its hush. It’s a fine spot to let the afternoon slip away. Each year brings more of those. Cars and people flood the city. They say it’s growing, a city in the throes of change. Headquartering a vast online empire for commerce and delivery, still showing the ache of growth. It calls to mind New York. Every soul bent on their own path, not much asked of you. Alone you can be, quiet, independent, and the world leaves you be. Not like the South, where concern shows you care. Here, no life is pried into. You keep your shell as long as you need, and the city rolls back like the tide. Lively place. With a pianist next door and two singers upstairs, there’s always something stirring. In some sense, it’s less a flat of strangers and more a kinship of friends. We gather for needs, mark birthdays, mourn farewells, lend a hand where we can. Lucky to be here, I reckon. Neighbors mostly good folk, and they treat me right. I clean up, leave them food, and they do the same. Carry mail back and forth. Nice to see them, and I think they find my company pleasing as well. I dwell in this vast, cold modern sprawl yet it’s folks like my neighbors that make me think I ain’t gone and wrecked my life.",
            "In the heartland where the land sprawls out like an old quilt, patched and mended, there lies a town caught on the edge of the city’s reach, where the concrete gives way to fields and the promise of quiet. I make my home on the eastern side of this town, a place where the dollar stretches thin and the roofs sit low under the weight of time. The houses, humble in their wearing, stand as if in quiet defiance, occupied by those who find their footing on the margins. Yet the streets are not without their grace, and the folks here, they nod and tip their hats, a silent kinship exchanged among strangers.\n\nThe specter of crime lingers at the edges, a whispered tale of the past decade: a scattering of violence, the crack of a gunshot in the night, the grief of a mother next door whose boy fell to the dark outside a bar. We’ve been spared, mostly, save for a trinket or two vanished from the porch when the dusk cloaks the world. The town bears the scars of a greater curse, an epidemic of powdered despair that steals breath and life, fentanyl its name, carving holes in families and futures. Yet here, against the tide, rise centers of hope, places of healing, where Narcan finds its way into hands ready to save.\n\nAmidst the trials, the town stands resilient, its virtues steadfast. My son finds sanctuary in the schoolhouse, where the walls echo with laughter and learning, untouched by cruelty despite the challenges he bears. The teachers, the principal, they form a bastion of goodwill and care, ushering each child with a gentle hand. The PTO breathes life into the halls, crafting moments of joy and togetherness. Poverty casts its shadow, yet no child feels its chill; meals are given freely, dignity preserved.\n\nThe council speaks of progress, their hands busy with the town’s face-lift, though their gaze seldom shifts eastward. Here on our side, the roads remain cracked, the parks overgrown, promises whispered but not kept, a thorn in the side of those who call this place home. Yet in spite of it all, I find solace here. The people, they are kind; the shops, sufficient; the life, enough. Our home, its worth measured not in gold but in comfort, stands as testament to sixteen years of roots sunk deep into this soil. And here, in this town, we remain, unable to picture a life beyond its borders.",
            "The neighborhood sprawls across the hill like some ancient thing, its bones wrapped in a shroud of history, buildings stacked with tales long told. I make my home in a seven-story edifice that stands sentinel across from the old theater where echoes linger. Down the slope, a block away, there's a small arcade bar where souls gather, drawn into its warmth like moths to a flame on summer's breath. On those nights, lines snake along the pavement, a testament to the life that pulses here.\n\nA few blocks further, the city park unfolds itself, a vast expanse of green framed by stone and concrete, steps hewn into its sides like scars. In the cold grip of winter, the homeless set their tents in rows, a testament to the struggle against the chill and the rain that falls relentless from a brooding sky. They huddle close, seeking warmth and solace in the heart of the city, not out in the wilderness where the jungle waits. The family center, a beacon of respite, lies within reach, offering the gift of warmth and water.\n\nYet it is not the storied architecture or the whispers of history that bind me to this place. It is the people, the culture that throbs within. Hilltop, once a name feared, a place of violence and dark tales, still breathes its stories. The streets remember the sweep of authority, the cleansing that left only memories behind. The people hold onto these tales, passing them down like heirlooms, marking the passage of time and change.\n\nThey labor still to cleanse their streets, to nurture their home. They speak of caution, of danger after dark, warnings flavored by the past, by the fears that linger. Perhaps my skin, shaded just enough, finds acceptance here, or perhaps they see in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the weight of history's burden, the shadows cast by ignorance and fear. This city, a supposed haven of diversity, still struggles with the ghosts of division.\n\nYet the Hilltop is my anchor, my home. In its embrace, I walk the night, alive and unafraid. Here, kindness finds me more often than malice. Strangers offer warmth where coldness might dwell. Laundromats remain open, their lights a refuge against the storm. And on the bleakest of nights, I find myself seen, valued by the tender act of a stranger’s hand.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when words fell flat against the hardness of new faces. Friends were hard to find. I found them nonetheless, a boy two doors down and another further along the street. They've long since moved, but the echoes of our days never left. Most folks who were here when I arrived remain as if time has held them in its quiet embrace. The place is like any other stretch of suburban America, two-story houses standing watch over their little plots of earth. Come the weekend or any warm day, the air fills with the laughter of children, yet the quiet holds its dominion through the week. There's a peace here, an understanding that a man is left to his own unless he seeks aid. Packages arrive on the doorstep and stay unmolested, a testament to the trust that binds the neighbors.\n\nA park lies a minute's walk from my door, a small green world of memory. There, I played basketball and football, the crack of the bat echoing in the evenings. It was there, too, that I took an elbow to the nose, a painful reminder that not all memories are sweet, yet the good far outweigh the bad. Now, when I wander that way, it is with my cousin's young ones, their eyes bright with the thrill of swings and slides. That park stirs something deep, a well of nostalgia that flows unbidden.\n\nThe neighborhood, a tapestry of faces and flavors. Within a mile, the scents of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian fare mingle in the air. Yet the world shifts, and convenience rules the day. GrubHub and DoorDash ferry meals to doorsteps, though the golden arches still beckon as they do in every suburb. Pizza abounds, a staple of American life. The stores, they offer all one might need. Dry cleaners dot the area, and there's a Walgreens and a CVS standing sentinel on the same street. Jewel-Osco, a beacon of the Midwest, serves the community's needs. Even diversity finds its place, an Indian-owned store offering spices and meals to those who seek them.\n\nIn all, I hold my neighborhood dear. The tales of neighborly strife that ripple across the digital world make me thankful for the peace that surrounds me. Here, in this quiet solace, I find contentment.",
            "The place where I live rests close by to the college I attend, and for this reason I find some contentment in dwelling there. The neighborhood is a patchwork of apartment buildings, with a scattering of eateries and bars that offer diversion without draining the purse too severely. One bar has taken on a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though its offerings and service aren't the worst one might find. The populace is generally of a decent sort. You'll find college youth mingling with those of humbler means, drawn by the affordability of the housing. Children abound, owing to the elementary school within a stone's throw from my abode. The neighbors remain strangers to me, and I prefer it so. They indulge in the smoking of weed, prompting the management to install an air freshener by their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing to the point of insult. The buildings around me bear the marks of age, though some may conceal renovated hearts. Further down the way stand newly minted apartments, but I hold them in low regard, knowing the shoddy craftsmanship that raised them. They charge dear for rent, a swindle made permissible by their proximity to the campus. There's a nearby eatery, cheap and cheerful, serving its fare on paper plates and warming meals by microwave. Across from it lies a gas station, reputedly a poor place of employment. Yet last summer saw the city bestow funds to refurbish the road, laying down a broad sidewalk with green medians, lending the area a touch of grace. My apartment is cloaked in trees, though a few have been felled, leaving stumps like gravestones. More trees shade my street than the road beyond. Behind my complex lies a tree line, then another spread of apartments. I reside on 42nd street; 43rd looms behind, less comely with sidewalks crumbling and buildings in disrepair. Trees line this street as if to hide its blemishes. Crime finds a home in a nearby complex and across the way, where residents come and go like whispers on the wind. Yet I find some fondness for where I dwell. It's within my means, and the conveniences it offers are ample. The university is but a short walk, and two bus stops grant swift passage to the store and downtown.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawled across the cul-de-sac like a tale half-told, duplexes scattered with the care of a child's hand arranging a toy village. Each building stood painted in a uniform yellow, with white porches and green roofs of metal that gleamed in the sun, giving them an appearance of singular homes though they were not. In this cluster of sameness, a kinship had formed among most, though not all, neighbors. As the day waned, we gathered, unbidden, at the end of a driveway to exchange words that floated on the warm air while children played out their own worlds with chalk and kites beneath a sky vast and blue, the clouds drifting like old ships in calm seas. It was here, in this place, that the noise of the modern world receded, a step back into a time less hurried.\n\nBeyond us lay fields and trees, their green depths touched by the sky's endless blue. But with the season came the threat of storms, and the night before had brought the wail of tornado sirens, the first I'd ever heard. We sought shelter, and I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and a purse filled with the little comforts of life, as the larger one barked his fear to the quiet room from the living room. The storm passed, leaving the ground littered with hail that sang its cold song as it melted away. The air, suddenly cool, steamed from the heat it had known moments before. In the aftermath, as the sun broke through and rain fell from a clearing sky, a double rainbow arced above, a promise painted in light. I seized my camera, captured the scene, and shared it with those who would marvel at such wonders, as did I. The street lay silent still, until life resumed its steady pace, mothers and children emerging as the evening meal cooked inside.\n\nI had come here, a stranger from the north, to find a community that spoke in a tongue soft with the southern drawl, a two-bedroom apartment like the others yet distinct within. Some were small, defying reason, but mine was a good fit. Behind stretched a vast field, and beyond that a pond where deer wandered and bullfrogs sang in the dawn. It was a place that felt remote, yet lay but forty minutes from the city of Charlotte. Roosters heralded the mornings, their calls mingling with the bray of a distant donkey, a reminder of the farms that circled us like sentinels of a bygone era. Here, in this corner of the world, I had found a place to call home.",
            "I reckon it's been near a decade I've walked these streets and breathed the air that fills this place. A soul can't help but gather tales to tell. When I first set foot in this neighborhood, sorrow was my shadow. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and the leaving tore me up inside. I cried for the days left behind, the faces I loved. My folks, they sought a better life for me and my sister. So we moved, chasing better houses and finer schools, places folks called not ghetto. As time unspooled, I grew accustomed to the new horizon. Made friends, made enemies too, in the halls of that school. The neighbors, they stayed distant save for Mr. Glen and his kin and Dennis, who lived right nearby. They became family in ways unspoken, and I hold them dear. I recall the day when me and my kin went to Mr. Glen’s wedding—his re-marrying. Joyful it was, a harbinger of dreams I keep for myself, to one day shower my own bride with the life of royalty. When Ms. Veda tossed that white garter, it was my hand that caught it. But the flowers eluded me. We danced till the stars blinked out, and I remember the laughter shared with Marsharii, but she's a ghost now, gone on her way. The neighborhood itself is a labyrinth, but with a GPS in hand, I wander its paths. I've ventured far only with Kason and Curtis, comrades in games and in life. We reveled in the simple things, the fleeting joys of youth. At times, I'd find solace in the park, nature's balm on a restless spirit. With sticks from the Home Depot, I'd practice balance, wield my bokken wooden sword. It's a joy that remains untouched by time. There's a court for basketball and tennis too, though it's been a spell since I laid hand to racket or ball. My dad, he nurtured a love for tennis in me and my friend alongside Mr. Graves, who pushed us hard, but we laughed all the way through. This place holds a tapestry of memories, and while many stories dwell here, these are the ones that linger, whispering of the promise the future holds untold.",
            "The town lies quiet beneath the Carolina sun, a modest settlement not marked by grandeur but by the silent labor of its fields. Johnston, they call it, the Peach Capital of the World, and the sign at the edge of it declares this proudly to any who might pass by. Farmland stretches out from the heart of the town, where peach trees stand in orderly rows and cattle dot the landscape like slow-moving shadows. Homes scatter themselves across this expanse, solitary and spaced, two-story structures with roofs of metal or gray shingle to beat back the heat of a relentless summer. They sit back from the road, yielding the front lands to the hands of farmers and the tread of beasts.\n\nIn the town’s small core, a single stoplight dangles above the crossroads, marking the place where commerce takes what little root it can. There are but a few places to find a meal prepared for you—Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese kitchen, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger joint. A pizzeria once graced this town, but it shuttered its doors in the recent past. Maxwell and Halford Drug stands, a tiny pharmacy with a reputation more for its Cherry Coca-Cola than its remedies. The Independent Grocers Alliance, known simply as IGA, is the lone grocery store, but many make the journey to Batesburg-Leesville’s Walmart for their larger needs. Dollar General is the lifeblood of the town’s commerce, its aisles crowded from dawn to dusk with those seeking the essentials of life.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More sits under the stewardship of a kind-hearted woman, her store a fixture of the community with two men employed to deliver the wares. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town’s pets with care, offering grooming and shelter in equal measure. A doctor’s office and a veterinary practice both lie beyond the town’s center, small yet sufficient to the needs of the people. Johnston Elementary School is where the young learn their letters and numbers until such time they must travel to the next town for further schooling.\n\nNo parks grace this place, though plans are afoot to carve out a space for families, a 2.5-acre hope for the future. The town lacks theaters and alleys of bowling, lacks places for children to play or for folks to gather. Yet there is a quiet charm to it, a simplicity that might be missed if you blink as you pass through, but for those who stop long enough to see, Johnston is a place where the world slows and one can breathe.",
            "In the heart of a small southern town in Tennessee, I dwell in a modest suburb. A street that stretches between two state highways, it draws more traffic than one might hope for, yet the neighborhood holds its quietude like a secret. The folks here, they don’t come and go much. I've come to know the rhythm of their lives, the hum of their daily labors, the yardwork that keeps them occupied. Winter finds us sledding down the hill on our side street, a brief, cold reprieve from the sameness of days. Our house sits at the corner, a sentinel that watches over all who pass by. Familiarity breeds with each car that rolls by, though a stranger's vehicle is noted with a certain curiosity. \n\nSome neighbors take to walking, a habit of health or necessity, dogs in tow. Children weave through the quiet on their bicycles. We, too, are at home more often than not, the nature of our work binding us to this place. My wife and I, along with our daughters, ages eleven and fourteen, have woven ourselves into the fabric of this street’s daily life. We venture out for play, unbothered by rain. The grill on the back deck sends up smoke and scent, a signal of small happiness. And there is the ever-present sound of lawn mowers from spring till the grass ceases its growth in October. Trees abound, remnants of an older forest, granting shade in summer and a cascade of leaves in fall, demanding the annual ritual of rake and burn. The scent of burning leaves, it’s the harbinger of autumn’s arrival.\n\nWinter has been scarce of late, stretching the fall into a long, unbroken pause. Our garage faces the back, so the front door sees little use unless a visitor calls, a rarity. I occupy myself with tasks in the garage, the truck and other projects, and with doors open, I feel the pulse of the neighborhood. Holidays pass quietly, Thanksgiving bringing a scattering of distant kin and their vehicles, a similar scene on Mother’s Day and Christmas. This place, I find a fondness for it. Were it not for the cars that hurry through, it might be nigh unto perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert sits a neighborhood of dust and earth, where the land stretches barren and brown under a relentless sun. Those who have not walked its parched ground cannot fathom the oppression of such a monochrome world, save for the rare oasis of green where a man has surrendered riches to coax life from the soil. When I first came here in the nineties, the houses were scattered far and wide, a testament to solitude. Even now, with the new structures rising, the essence remains. The sprawl speaks of a city, yet it mirrors the change found in all places. People here bear warmth in their hearts, though shadows linger as in any town. My own corner of this desert is surrounded by kindly elders, marking it a refuge of sorts. The commerce of this place is dominated by familiar names, chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For the finer things, one must journey afar, for Whole Foods and their ilk are strangers here. Construction reigns in the trade of men, for this city is a canvas yet to be filled, its expanses inviting the hand of progress. This prospect unsettles me, for I cherish the present state, having fled the clamor of a metropolis and unwilling to return. I labor in this field, a craftsman of drywall and T-bar, marking my days with the rhythm of creation.\n\nYet the land holds its own allure, a sanctuary for creatures adapted to its harsh embrace. The desert's stark beauty draws souls seeking its truth, its challenging ecosystems demanding respect for coexistence. We, too, have found our place among the wild things, my children captivated by lizards and the myriad insects of the sands. Even as I write, their laughter echoes outside as they pursue their quarry. Our town offers its diversions, a taste of adventure in the embrace of Victorville. It is a haven for families, the desert unfolding its mysteries. Plan to visit when the San Bernardino County Fair enlivens the air, offering a Victorville welcome. Venture to nearby Wrightwood, where snow-capped peaks promise lessons in winter's arts. For those drawn to the origins of this land, the Victor Valley Museum stands with its relics of geology and ancient peoples, chronicling the tale of Victorville's rise from the dust.",
            "In the telling of my neighborhood, I reckon my answer might strike as peculiar. Where others might speak of picket fences and lawns, I speak of a place more transient and yet, for a time, eternal. The college campus where I bide my days, it is the land I call home, and the souls within the dormitory walls, they are my kin. Beyond them lies the campus, which sprawls like a yard untamed, a neighborhood in its own right, though lesser and more diffuse.\n\nYet here lies the truth of it: my neighborhood, though strange, is not so unlike those places people call home. It has its own houses, its own people, its own shops and parks. Let me take you through the houses that stand in this peculiar quarter. Three sorts there are—apartments, true houses, and those dormitory halls. In the apartments, they stack folk two or four to a chamber, with four to six chambers a floor. Two stories they rise, and twenty souls they hold, give or take.\n\nThen there are the houses, proper homes for those bound to the school, mostly alumni, who dwell within their two to four room confines. But scarce are these, scattered few across the land, for they are not efficient. Last, there are the dormitories—long corridors lined with rooms where hundreds of students abide. In each, two share a space, for the most part, and these dorms are the heart of my neighborhood.\n\nNow with the houses spoken for, let us turn to the people. The school takes pride in its diversity, and it is here, in the faces you meet in the halls and on the paths. From all lands and ages they come, making this place a tapestry of the world. The staff, they find shelter in the scattered houses, while new students fill the dorms and the older ones take to the apartments.\n\nAs for the stores and the parks, these too are part of my world. The campus is a town unto itself, with a bounty of shops and one lone park. There are places to eat, as there are in any town, and stores with the school’s own wares. In this neighborhood, whatever you seek is within reach. The park, a small respite, is a haven where all gather, kept clean and safe by the hands of those who dwell here.",
            "In the place where I reside, sidewalks are few and far between. The land falls away, giving itself to gravity, and my dwelling stands at the pinnacle of the steepest incline that the local folk know as the \"work out hill,\" for it beckons those who seek to test their mettle upon its slope. No sidewalks grace our street, so the people walk upon the asphalt, where the road is rough-hewn and treacherous to traverse. The wires of telephone and electric strung overhead hang in tatters, battered by the gales and storms that sweep through our land, leaving branches and debris to fell them time and again, their repair a patchwork quilt of human endeavor. Towering evergreens cast their long shadows all around, yet they are not cherished. No, the folk here wield their axes against them, for they covet the view of the sea, unbroken and vast. Thus, the houses rise high upon the hillside, glass-fronted and lofty, seeking the bay's embrace. At day's end, the sun kindles the water, and the heavens burn with orange, though oftentimes the clouds conspire to shroud that celestial fire. The days are gray and wet, and moss clings to all it can, to roofs and cars and railings alike. Once, I left my automobile idle in the drive for a month, and when I returned, it wore a green and furry coat of moss that took three hours to scrape clean. Here, children are scarce, though a school lies but a few blocks distant. My neighbors are mostly of the older sort, many having surrendered to retirement. In place of children, they keep dogs. You’ll see them lounging on lawns or racing down the street, and woe to those who leave a door or window ajar, for the dogs will venture in unbidden. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it back out. Rabbits run rampant, too, some well-sized, much to the chagrin of the gardeners, who curse their burrows and their plundering of roots. My cats, they delight in the chase and have driven most rabbits from our midst. Birds are plentiful, flitting sparrows and hummingbirds, and now and then a hawk or eagle will appear, only to be chased away by the crows that rule the sky. Shops do not dwell here, but down the hill at the water’s edge, a few eateries serve the bounty of the sea. The beach is scant, but the rocks along the shore are fit for casting into the depths, and the bay is narrow; you can glimpse the far shore even through the mist that clings like a shroud most days.",
            "If you find yourself bound for Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, know that you will not struggle to find your way. The city’s arteries of steel and rail run deep and wide, carrying the masses to and fro with the ceaseless clamor of New York’s own breath. Bensonhurst stands proudly urban, its streets echoing the same rhythms that pulse through the heart of the city itself. And as you wander those streets, your eyes will fall upon the myriad Asian shops that have taken root. In the passing of two decades, the neighborhood has welcomed an influx of Asian souls, their presence marked by the scent of spice and the hum of commerce. Every block tells the tale, a testament to the supermarkets and laundromats that dot the landscape, serving the people with the nourishment they seek and the cleanliness they crave. The food is good, the prices fair, and the convenience unrivaled. Just beyond where I stand, four Asian markets lie clustered within two minutes' walk of each other, each a beacon of sustenance.\n\nYet do not let it be said that Bensonhurst is solely a haven for the Asian community. It is a mosaic, diverse and sprawling, with immigrants and their children, first and second generation, weaving the rich tapestry of life here. The businesses, large and small, speak of Asian ownership, yet they coexist alongside a recently renewed park, a refuge of play and sport. There, the earth is marked with ten basketball courts, a broad field for soccer or baseball, and courts for handball, swings, and a playground for the young ones. Even a fountain stands to bring joy in the heat of summer. The park is a testament to the city’s diversity, where all manner of folk gather and find common ground.\n\nThe skyline here is not pierced by the monoliths of corporate ambition, but rather by dwellings of cooperative living and condominium stature. Predominantly, it is a place of two-family homes, where life unfolds with a certain clatter. The people are kind, though their voices are loud. The air is filled with the roar of engines and the thrum of music as cars pass by, relentless and waking the dawn. Should your visit find you beneath the night’s cloak, be wary. The neighborhood, though safe, is unpredictable as the city’s own soul. Trouble may arise unbidden, in the form of bullies or thieves. I have felt it myself in years past, the sting of assault, and more recently, the theft of parcels. Such is the way of things. And though the city demands cleanliness, the rule is oft ignored. The morning light reveals the neglect, the dog waste that mars the path to the train or the market. It is a vexation, an affront to the senses, and one must tread carefully to keep their shoes unsullied.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, a town known to some as a bastion of oddity, there lies a truth about the very notion of \"weird.\" Scrawled upon the brick of a building that harbors a pizza joint, bar, music hall, and strip club, a phrase boldly declares, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To the few who remember, it calls back to the Portland of another time, a place less exposed to the world, where creativity roamed untethered in the shadows of the 90s and early 2000s. To others, it is a siren’s song, a lure to a city where the label of weird is worn like a medal of honor. Despite the tide of Californians with their gilded pockets and the rise of glass towers to shelter them, Portland remains untamed. Weirdness here does not always mean open arms, but rather an embrace of the unorthodox. It does not shun modernity, nor its struggles. Like the rest of the nation, we trade with the far East, our goods shipped from China’s distant shores. There are countless ways to be strange, to deviate from the norm, yet Portland holds its share of the mundane. It has yoga studios, hipsters, and men in suits. Perhaps being weird is simply to gaze upon all this with a wry smile. In my part of town, as in many corners of Portland, houses stand adorned in hues of the rainbow, gardens spill their bounty onto the sidewalk, and free boxes appear with the sun. These boxes, often simple cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold within them the magic of serendipity, offering treasures to the passerby. They brim with clothes, books, and sometimes the unexpected. This simple wonder of wandering the streets of Southeast Portland is the essence of the city, at least to me, though I am but one peculiar soul among many. Among us are those who would never dream of fetching garments from a box left on the curb. These folks linger at goat yoga—yes, the mats shared with bleating companions—or cheer at Timbers matches. Portland is a mosaic of passions, of dreams pursued or merely contemplated over drinks in dimly lit bars. It harbors a malaise of substances, a shadow cast by the mind’s turmoil, perhaps nurtured by the unending rain and the oppressive gray of the sky. Homelessness is another specter that haunts the city, a dilemma unsolved, despite the services that outshine much of the nation. The housed oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this, Portland is not so peculiar after all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal, ever present in the north, bearing silent witness to the sun's pilgrimage at dawn and dusk. No matter the forgetfulness of men or the ceaseless pace of their lives, they remain steadfast, untouched by the brief tribulations that consume us. And on those days when the weight of the world bears down and the soul strains under its yoke, the mountains call out with a quiet insistence. They compel the eyes to look upon them, and in that gaze, there comes a balm for the anxious spirit, a quiet fortitude to endure another day. I came to this land as a young scholar, my heart and mind drawn to the mountains that stood sentinel to the north of the campus. The university, with its grand buildings and serene ponds, has its own allure, but it is the mountains that hold dominion over my heart. The town itself carries a humble beauty. Countless cafés have played host to hours of study beneath the caffeinated haze. One can wander or take the bus to the heart of the town, where the faded bricks of restaurants and offices whisper tales of old. Here, this suburban place hums with the vigor of its urban neighbor, though the thrumming energy fades as you pass the library and find yourself once more in the quiet embrace of small-town life. This juxtaposition of worlds, so close yet distinct, lends the city a mysterious charm, beckoning the curious to explore its depths. Thus, it is easy to craft memories, each tied to a corner of the town. Be it the rusted swings in the park swaying in the night wind or the race through the bustling streets to catch a film at the grand theater. Yet, as with all places, it holds its share of harsh memories. The ponds, reflections of the soul, serve as sanctuaries for solitude or tears shed in the hours when time seems to stand still. Here, in the company of turtles and ducks and insects, all fulfilling their purpose, I ponder my own role in this vast enigma called life. I walk past the pond, past the park, past the houses that breathe suburbia, until the street unfurls before me. The sun casts its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky with its brilliance, and I realize my footsteps take me northward. And there, as always, are the mountains. Majestic and unwavering, they brush against the sky, a testament to endurance that speaks to the heart without uttering a word.",
            "It might escape your notice at first, the way things do when they are not meant to be seen or when they hide in plain sight. A residential sprawl tucked behind the commerce of consumption and need, a place you'd not likely reckon to find folks calling home. Yet if you venture past the derelict Whole Foods and sidle beyond the yearly occupied hotels, their empty rooms waiting for summer kin, you’ll come upon a living, breathing world. Streets unfurl with quiet purpose, and there lie clusters of apartment complexes, each one nestled against the other like Russian dolls dismantled and laid side by side in a deliberate line. The first of these has made the news, whispered tales of ill repute, but such talk is just smoke in the wind. There is more to see, more to know, in the apartments beyond, where life unfolds unbeknownst to the wider world.\n\nAcross from these homes of concrete and glass stands a community college's outpost, a sentinel of learning where students trickle in, clutching coffee and yawns, to greet the morning’s reluctant dawn. The gates groan open in greeting, and students slip through like ghosts, while drivers curse the delay, the inconvenience of it all. The road bends and breaks into another, flanked by a park and a place where broken bones find healing. The rehabilitation center stands with an air of cheer, its porch adorned with furniture and a fan that stirs the heavy summer air in lazy circles.\n\nChildren dance in the park, their limbs flailing in wild abandon, a blur of movement on the green, while bees hover above the flowers, drunk on the sun. Old souls shuffle with their dogs along the path, casting disapproving eyes at the skaters and nodding with soft approval at the young girls who gather to spin tales of boys and fleeting fame. Nearby, a sushi joint offers its wares, its tables never too crowded, while a place to buy swimming supplies and a nail salon sit in patient company. Here, the strip mall promises convenience, a trifecta of pleasure and necessity, where one might indulge in a manicure, a meal, and pool accouterments in one fell swoop. And there’s a frozen yogurt shop too, where teenagers come to cool their tongues and pretend at wisdom, cups of sweetness in hand as they weave across the pavement on their boards, smoke curling from their lips, believing it all to be the height of rebellion. This neighborhood is a tapestry of the American South, where the slow march of time barely registers, and life continues in its unchanging dance.",
            "The neighborhood stands in quiet witness to a bygone era. Houses, mostly singular in their countenance, stand like silent sentinels, though a few have been cleaved into twain yet remain conjoined, if such a thing makes sense. Before my abode, a modest patch of land lies, and to its flank, a narrow drive. These homes, like echoes of another time, speak of dreams once held dear beneath the vast, indifferent sky. The dream of suburbia, an American vision now slipping through grasping fingers, yet still these streets endure, whispering to all who pass that the dream yet breathes, and we cling to its fading promise.\n\nThe folk here, they do not brim with the optimism of yesteryear. The little plots of green are not tended as they once were, but still, there are cars resting in the drives, still the young ones heedless in their play, as if the world beyond were but a distant rumor. The old school, near ninety years standing, still looms, nurturing the young while stirring memory in the aged hearts. Churches stand scattered, more often empty than filled, yet the basketball courts echo with life. The homes, each with its own face, share a soul.\n\nA vast market, Super A, sits under the watchful eye of a Yemeni clan, perhaps the sole Arabs here, amidst a sea of African American neighbors. The streets stretch wide where children play football, only halting when the rumble of cars intrudes. Generations have passed through these streets, each with tales of a time when all knew all. A karate school once thrived here, until the allure waned with the silencing of Hollywood's tales of karate kids. Now it stands as a pharmacy, a place where remedies are promised, or so it is said.\n\nA humble cinema persists, offering old films at a price that draws the elders, nostalgic for simpler nights, while the young seek elsewhere. An expressway cuts near, though its entrance lies just beyond our reach. Once, a petition sought to bring it closer, the youth in favor, the elders wary. In the end, it was the elders' voices that stilled the city council’s hand, fearing it would mar the town's essence. A new high school rises, and with it, the question of a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin might capture the spirit of this place.",
            "In the sprawl of this city where I make my home, the neighborhood unfolds like a quilt of manifold hues. The streets weave through a patchwork of residences and commerce, the latter bustling with offices and stores, eateries and places where folk find their mirth. The air is thick with the scent of new restaurants, each vying for the palate, and shops where one might find anything their heart desires. There are the great monoliths of commerce, the brands whose names carry weight, and yet these are flanked by the small boutiques, each with its own whispering allure. They stand in the malls and line the streets, close enough to the quiet enclaves of homes that one might hear the murmur of city life at their threshold.\n\nParks stand as islands amidst the urban sea, where the laughter of children mingles with the rustle of leaves. And the people here, they are as varied as the sky at dawn. Within a stone's throw, you find the vibrant communities of LGBTQ+ folks, the devout Orthodox Jews, and those who have journeyed from the lands of the once mighty Soviet Union. Beyond this small realm, the city stretches further into enclaves of every kind. There is a Korea town, a China town, a Little Armenia, all within a scant few miles, though those miles can stretch into hours when the roads are choked with the gridlock of human endeavor.\n\nFew walk in this city, for the distances are vast and the streets unfriendly to the pedestrian. The traffic is a beast with no master, and parking a prize hard won. Yet the city grows, ever taller and denser, as new apartments rise from the earth. This place draws folk like a beacon, and with them come more cars to clog the arteries of the city. Houses here are a tapestry of forms, from the single-family homes to the duplexes that share their walls. In my own corner of this metropolis, the homes stand varied and diverse, much like the people who dwell within them.\n\nThe faces here are many, the ages varied, though it is a lonesome truth that I know few of those who live beside me. The bonds of community have loosened, though I hold dear the memories of days spent in the company of neighbors, the laughter of children echoing in the warmth of the sunlit streets. The city, vast and sprawling, has changed, yet it holds within it the echoes of what once was.",
            "Where is everything, she asked, as we rolled past those endless cornfields that stretched out to meet the sky. This is it, I said, knowing the expanse would lay her soul bare. She came from a place where the grocer's was a mere five-minute walk, and she had never laid eyes on so much unbroken ground. Awash in the vastness, I told her of a life grown in rural Ohio, and in that telling, she saw the shadow of who I was and the soil from which I had sprung. We drove the narrow road, a ribbon of asphalt that wound to a quarry brimming with water, and there beyond lay the little settlement I called home. The houses were brick and stucco, each spread with half an acre of earth that folks tended as their own. Spring would find the land awash in flowers planted new each year, trees in their midwestern dress changing with the seasons. Driveways flaunted their luxury, Mercedes Benzes catching the midday sun like jewels. As we neared my gray stucco abode, my Korean neighbor stood in his yard, ever smiling. He passed his days with the mower, a song rising over its hum. The neighborhood found humor in him, but he was sincere and rich in his tales. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and his John Deere as if part of the ground itself. At last, you would come to my door. The side yard teemed with geese, ever pursued by the terrier. Behind, a slender stream fed into the quarry, where bullfrogs sang and the far-off low of cattle reached the ear. Across a bridge of hand-hewn wood lay a sanctuary untouched, where trees grew wild and herbs and flowers flourished. That was the world of my youth. Building forts in trees and the chase of imagined prey filled our days, always another child for company. Winters here could be cruel in their cold, yet possessed a beauty unmatched. The yard's green turned to a white wilderness. The trees, once flushed with color, stood as bare-boned sentinels. When snow came, the world transformed overnight. Snow angels made by my sister adorned the yard, snowmen too. We were fierce in our play, snowballs the weapons of our quarrels. We built igloos with branches, an armory of our own. In that frozen world, we lived in pretend, two children without a care. The world beyond was naught but a distant echo, and we were free."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies a small town in Michigan, where the road stretches from vast farmlands to quaint tourist cities. It is a place devoid of sprawling malls or the bright lights of Wal-mart, Target, or even the humble glow of an Applebee’s. Here, the open land demands you drive to your destination, yet it is a place of untouched beauty, wrapped in the embrace of water. My town, if you can call it that, finds itself nestled between the grand expanse of Lake Michigan and the serene waters of Lake Charlevoix. Shores stretch out, inviting the weary to rest their feet in the cool embrace of the sand and surf.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks in the quiet tongue of small-town life. Houses stand apart, not the uniformity of modernity but relics of a bygone era, some tended to with care, others left to the ravages of time. Full basements peer from beneath the ground along the streets, and aluminum siding glints under the sun. The spectrum of home colors paints the blocks in a myriad of hues, each with a yard where children’s laughter echoes from trampolines and playsets. Gardens grow in the care of those who tend to them, fences keep the animals safe. It is the visage of Middle America, where laboring hands strive to carve out a living, nurturing the young or reflecting on the past.\n\nIn this place, the streets are alive with the patter of children’s feet, the bark of a dog, the hum of bicycles and rollerblades. Neighbors nod in recognition, a silent understanding of who belongs. A grill sends up smoke as a friendly wave passes between strangers, a smile exchanged from afar. Lawns are kept neat, leaves banished, the grass a verdant carpet beneath the feet. It may not be a neighborhood that inspires awe, but it is a sanctuary, a haven for families to grow and find their peace. The quiet speaks volumes; it is a place of safety, a refuge at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s department stands watch, the health department its neighbor, and the recycling center serves the community’s needs. The crack of bat against ball echoes from fields where children play, their names called out by unseen voices. And the small town airport, where the roar of engines shatters the silence, planes climbing into the open sky. Ice cream waits within walking distance, a sweet reward for those who venture downtown. Eight blocks away, the park welcomes my children’s bikes. It is a place of simple joys and unassuming grace, a good place to call home.",
            "In the land where the houses stand in neat rows like sentinels of some forgotten order, there lies the neighborhood that wears the face of the commonplace. A suburbia wrought by the hand of uniformity, sculpted under the stern eye of the homeowner's association. Upon entry, you are greeted by the unyielding symmetry of manicured lawns and homes that whisper the same secrets, each with a patch of green, some stones scattered like the memories of lost landscapes, and driveways that stretch briefly from street to home. The trees, sparse and deliberate, stand as if planted by some ancient decree. Each domicile boasts a garage for two, a testament to the lives within.\n\nAs you traverse this place, the roads, smooth as a river's stone, bear no blemish nor scar. The asphalt, unmarked by time's passage, speaks of a relentless upkeep that defies the entropy of the world beyond. The houses, mostly of a single story, rise occasionally to two, breaking the horizon like the quiet rise of a thought unspoken. Mailboxes do not stand solitary at the curb but gather at the street's end in a cluster, a congregation of metal that demands a key for entry, parcels held in lockers as if secrets kept by the community itself.\n\nThe boundary of this neighborhood lies at the edge of the city's reach, a place where the rural and the suburban converge, giving rise to expanses of land that invite the wanderer to walk its paths. Pools, gated and pristine, lie in wait for those who seek solace in their waters. Trails wind through the community, offering the promise of solitude or the company of a faithful hound at one's side. Here, exercise needs no park, for the neighborhood is vast enough to hold your running feet.\n\nThe souls who dwell here are mostly those who have seen the seasons turn many times, retirees who watch over one another with a quiet vigilance. Yet, among them, the young professionals and the middle-aged find their place, adding their stories to the tapestry of life here. The city nearby, a paradox of size and intimacy, offers its bounty of amenities. A single mall stands as the heart of commerce, modest in size but sufficient to the needs of those who seek its wares. Fifteen minutes by car will take you to any place of note, where high-end grocers share space with outlets of frugality, each with their own tale to tell.\n\nAnd so this place, safe and tended with care, holds within it the trappings of a familiar life. The pools and trails, the order and the quiet, all speak of a world crafted for comfort. Though the shopping lies a journey away, it is but a small price for the peace this land bestows.",
            "The first I’d heard of the place was listening to some broadcast about lost souls. It caught me off guard, unexpected like. Every flat around here runs up past a thousand a month and nobody ever spoke of such tales, not to me or any of the folks I knew. Maybe it’s the struggle. I know some who cry themselves to sleep, though they won’t say it. The cost of things bears down hard but we’ve learned to scrape by. You come to embrace the scent of old toys and clothes kept from the moths. You find yourself smelling less as the years weigh in. Maybe you take up smoking or maybe you just grow used to the way of things. But the flea market stands its ground. The odor of grown days is dusty stacks of magazines on a silent piano. It settles in the leather and stays there even after washing. Around here, three thrift stores lie within strolling distance. Start on the far side and you’ll see two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book shop, and a curio store. Downtown’s tight with cars and bodies, filling the streets at dawn, but you’d never hear them in the thrifts. No matter the passing crowd or traffic, the place holds its hush. It’s a fine spot to let the afternoon slip away. Each year brings more of those. Cars and people flood the city. They say it’s growing, a city in the throes of change. Headquartering a vast online empire for commerce and delivery, still showing the ache of growth. It calls to mind New York. Every soul bent on their own path, not much asked of you. Alone you can be, quiet, independent, and the world leaves you be. Not like the South, where concern shows you care. Here, no life is pried into. You keep your shell as long as you need, and the city rolls back like the tide. Lively place. With a pianist next door and two singers upstairs, there’s always something stirring. In some sense, it’s less a flat of strangers and more a kinship of friends. We gather for needs, mark birthdays, mourn farewells, lend a hand where we can. Lucky to be here, I reckon. Neighbors mostly good folk, and they treat me right. I clean up, leave them food, and they do the same. Carry mail back and forth. Nice to see them, and I think they find my company pleasing as well. I dwell in this vast, cold modern sprawl yet it’s folks like my neighbors that make me think I ain’t gone and wrecked my life.",
            "In the heartland where the land sprawls out like an old quilt, patched and mended, there lies a town caught on the edge of the city’s reach, where the concrete gives way to fields and the promise of quiet. I make my home on the eastern side of this town, a place where the dollar stretches thin and the roofs sit low under the weight of time. The houses, humble in their wearing, stand as if in quiet defiance, occupied by those who find their footing on the margins. Yet the streets are not without their grace, and the folks here, they nod and tip their hats, a silent kinship exchanged among strangers.\n\nThe specter of crime lingers at the edges, a whispered tale of the past decade: a scattering of violence, the crack of a gunshot in the night, the grief of a mother next door whose boy fell to the dark outside a bar. We’ve been spared, mostly, save for a trinket or two vanished from the porch when the dusk cloaks the world. The town bears the scars of a greater curse, an epidemic of powdered despair that steals breath and life, fentanyl its name, carving holes in families and futures. Yet here, against the tide, rise centers of hope, places of healing, where Narcan finds its way into hands ready to save.\n\nAmidst the trials, the town stands resilient, its virtues steadfast. My son finds sanctuary in the schoolhouse, where the walls echo with laughter and learning, untouched by cruelty despite the challenges he bears. The teachers, the principal, they form a bastion of goodwill and care, ushering each child with a gentle hand. The PTO breathes life into the halls, crafting moments of joy and togetherness. Poverty casts its shadow, yet no child feels its chill; meals are given freely, dignity preserved.\n\nThe council speaks of progress, their hands busy with the town’s face-lift, though their gaze seldom shifts eastward. Here on our side, the roads remain cracked, the parks overgrown, promises whispered but not kept, a thorn in the side of those who call this place home. Yet in spite of it all, I find solace here. The people, they are kind; the shops, sufficient; the life, enough. Our home, its worth measured not in gold but in comfort, stands as testament to sixteen years of roots sunk deep into this soil. And here, in this town, we remain, unable to picture a life beyond its borders.",
            "The neighborhood sprawls across the hill like some ancient thing, its bones wrapped in a shroud of history, buildings stacked with tales long told. I make my home in a seven-story edifice that stands sentinel across from the old theater where echoes linger. Down the slope, a block away, there's a small arcade bar where souls gather, drawn into its warmth like moths to a flame on summer's breath. On those nights, lines snake along the pavement, a testament to the life that pulses here.\n\nA few blocks further, the city park unfolds itself, a vast expanse of green framed by stone and concrete, steps hewn into its sides like scars. In the cold grip of winter, the homeless set their tents in rows, a testament to the struggle against the chill and the rain that falls relentless from a brooding sky. They huddle close, seeking warmth and solace in the heart of the city, not out in the wilderness where the jungle waits. The family center, a beacon of respite, lies within reach, offering the gift of warmth and water.\n\nYet it is not the storied architecture or the whispers of history that bind me to this place. It is the people, the culture that throbs within. Hilltop, once a name feared, a place of violence and dark tales, still breathes its stories. The streets remember the sweep of authority, the cleansing that left only memories behind. The people hold onto these tales, passing them down like heirlooms, marking the passage of time and change.\n\nThey labor still to cleanse their streets, to nurture their home. They speak of caution, of danger after dark, warnings flavored by the past, by the fears that linger. Perhaps my skin, shaded just enough, finds acceptance here, or perhaps they see in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the weight of history's burden, the shadows cast by ignorance and fear. This city, a supposed haven of diversity, still struggles with the ghosts of division.\n\nYet the Hilltop is my anchor, my home. In its embrace, I walk the night, alive and unafraid. Here, kindness finds me more often than malice. Strangers offer warmth where coldness might dwell. Laundromats remain open, their lights a refuge against the storm. And on the bleakest of nights, I find myself seen, valued by the tender act of a stranger’s hand.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when words fell flat against the hardness of new faces. Friends were hard to find. I found them nonetheless, a boy two doors down and another further along the street. They've long since moved, but the echoes of our days never left. Most folks who were here when I arrived remain as if time has held them in its quiet embrace. The place is like any other stretch of suburban America, two-story houses standing watch over their little plots of earth. Come the weekend or any warm day, the air fills with the laughter of children, yet the quiet holds its dominion through the week. There's a peace here, an understanding that a man is left to his own unless he seeks aid. Packages arrive on the doorstep and stay unmolested, a testament to the trust that binds the neighbors.\n\nA park lies a minute's walk from my door, a small green world of memory. There, I played basketball and football, the crack of the bat echoing in the evenings. It was there, too, that I took an elbow to the nose, a painful reminder that not all memories are sweet, yet the good far outweigh the bad. Now, when I wander that way, it is with my cousin's young ones, their eyes bright with the thrill of swings and slides. That park stirs something deep, a well of nostalgia that flows unbidden.\n\nThe neighborhood, a tapestry of faces and flavors. Within a mile, the scents of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian fare mingle in the air. Yet the world shifts, and convenience rules the day. GrubHub and DoorDash ferry meals to doorsteps, though the golden arches still beckon as they do in every suburb. Pizza abounds, a staple of American life. The stores, they offer all one might need. Dry cleaners dot the area, and there's a Walgreens and a CVS standing sentinel on the same street. Jewel-Osco, a beacon of the Midwest, serves the community's needs. Even diversity finds its place, an Indian-owned store offering spices and meals to those who seek them.\n\nIn all, I hold my neighborhood dear. The tales of neighborly strife that ripple across the digital world make me thankful for the peace that surrounds me. Here, in this quiet solace, I find contentment.",
            "The place where I live rests close by to the college I attend, and for this reason I find some contentment in dwelling there. The neighborhood is a patchwork of apartment buildings, with a scattering of eateries and bars that offer diversion without draining the purse too severely. One bar has taken on a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though its offerings and service aren't the worst one might find. The populace is generally of a decent sort. You'll find college youth mingling with those of humbler means, drawn by the affordability of the housing. Children abound, owing to the elementary school within a stone's throw from my abode. The neighbors remain strangers to me, and I prefer it so. They indulge in the smoking of weed, prompting the management to install an air freshener by their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing to the point of insult. The buildings around me bear the marks of age, though some may conceal renovated hearts. Further down the way stand newly minted apartments, but I hold them in low regard, knowing the shoddy craftsmanship that raised them. They charge dear for rent, a swindle made permissible by their proximity to the campus. There's a nearby eatery, cheap and cheerful, serving its fare on paper plates and warming meals by microwave. Across from it lies a gas station, reputedly a poor place of employment. Yet last summer saw the city bestow funds to refurbish the road, laying down a broad sidewalk with green medians, lending the area a touch of grace. My apartment is cloaked in trees, though a few have been felled, leaving stumps like gravestones. More trees shade my street than the road beyond. Behind my complex lies a tree line, then another spread of apartments. I reside on 42nd street; 43rd looms behind, less comely with sidewalks crumbling and buildings in disrepair. Trees line this street as if to hide its blemishes. Crime finds a home in a nearby complex and across the way, where residents come and go like whispers on the wind. Yet I find some fondness for where I dwell. It's within my means, and the conveniences it offers are ample. The university is but a short walk, and two bus stops grant swift passage to the store and downtown.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawled across the cul-de-sac like a tale half-told, duplexes scattered with the care of a child's hand arranging a toy village. Each building stood painted in a uniform yellow, with white porches and green roofs of metal that gleamed in the sun, giving them an appearance of singular homes though they were not. In this cluster of sameness, a kinship had formed among most, though not all, neighbors. As the day waned, we gathered, unbidden, at the end of a driveway to exchange words that floated on the warm air while children played out their own worlds with chalk and kites beneath a sky vast and blue, the clouds drifting like old ships in calm seas. It was here, in this place, that the noise of the modern world receded, a step back into a time less hurried.\n\nBeyond us lay fields and trees, their green depths touched by the sky's endless blue. But with the season came the threat of storms, and the night before had brought the wail of tornado sirens, the first I'd ever heard. We sought shelter, and I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and a purse filled with the little comforts of life, as the larger one barked his fear to the quiet room from the living room. The storm passed, leaving the ground littered with hail that sang its cold song as it melted away. The air, suddenly cool, steamed from the heat it had known moments before. In the aftermath, as the sun broke through and rain fell from a clearing sky, a double rainbow arced above, a promise painted in light. I seized my camera, captured the scene, and shared it with those who would marvel at such wonders, as did I. The street lay silent still, until life resumed its steady pace, mothers and children emerging as the evening meal cooked inside.\n\nI had come here, a stranger from the north, to find a community that spoke in a tongue soft with the southern drawl, a two-bedroom apartment like the others yet distinct within. Some were small, defying reason, but mine was a good fit. Behind stretched a vast field, and beyond that a pond where deer wandered and bullfrogs sang in the dawn. It was a place that felt remote, yet lay but forty minutes from the city of Charlotte. Roosters heralded the mornings, their calls mingling with the bray of a distant donkey, a reminder of the farms that circled us like sentinels of a bygone era. Here, in this corner of the world, I had found a place to call home.",
            "I reckon it's been near a decade I've walked these streets and breathed the air that fills this place. A soul can't help but gather tales to tell. When I first set foot in this neighborhood, sorrow was my shadow. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and the leaving tore me up inside. I cried for the days left behind, the faces I loved. My folks, they sought a better life for me and my sister. So we moved, chasing better houses and finer schools, places folks called not ghetto. As time unspooled, I grew accustomed to the new horizon. Made friends, made enemies too, in the halls of that school. The neighbors, they stayed distant save for Mr. Glen and his kin and Dennis, who lived right nearby. They became family in ways unspoken, and I hold them dear. I recall the day when me and my kin went to Mr. Glen’s wedding—his re-marrying. Joyful it was, a harbinger of dreams I keep for myself, to one day shower my own bride with the life of royalty. When Ms. Veda tossed that white garter, it was my hand that caught it. But the flowers eluded me. We danced till the stars blinked out, and I remember the laughter shared with Marsharii, but she's a ghost now, gone on her way. The neighborhood itself is a labyrinth, but with a GPS in hand, I wander its paths. I've ventured far only with Kason and Curtis, comrades in games and in life. We reveled in the simple things, the fleeting joys of youth. At times, I'd find solace in the park, nature's balm on a restless spirit. With sticks from the Home Depot, I'd practice balance, wield my bokken wooden sword. It's a joy that remains untouched by time. There's a court for basketball and tennis too, though it's been a spell since I laid hand to racket or ball. My dad, he nurtured a love for tennis in me and my friend alongside Mr. Graves, who pushed us hard, but we laughed all the way through. This place holds a tapestry of memories, and while many stories dwell here, these are the ones that linger, whispering of the promise the future holds untold.",
            "The town lies quiet beneath the Carolina sun, a modest settlement not marked by grandeur but by the silent labor of its fields. Johnston, they call it, the Peach Capital of the World, and the sign at the edge of it declares this proudly to any who might pass by. Farmland stretches out from the heart of the town, where peach trees stand in orderly rows and cattle dot the landscape like slow-moving shadows. Homes scatter themselves across this expanse, solitary and spaced, two-story structures with roofs of metal or gray shingle to beat back the heat of a relentless summer. They sit back from the road, yielding the front lands to the hands of farmers and the tread of beasts.\n\nIn the town’s small core, a single stoplight dangles above the crossroads, marking the place where commerce takes what little root it can. There are but a few places to find a meal prepared for you—Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese kitchen, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger joint. A pizzeria once graced this town, but it shuttered its doors in the recent past. Maxwell and Halford Drug stands, a tiny pharmacy with a reputation more for its Cherry Coca-Cola than its remedies. The Independent Grocers Alliance, known simply as IGA, is the lone grocery store, but many make the journey to Batesburg-Leesville’s Walmart for their larger needs. Dollar General is the lifeblood of the town’s commerce, its aisles crowded from dawn to dusk with those seeking the essentials of life.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More sits under the stewardship of a kind-hearted woman, her store a fixture of the community with two men employed to deliver the wares. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town’s pets with care, offering grooming and shelter in equal measure. A doctor’s office and a veterinary practice both lie beyond the town’s center, small yet sufficient to the needs of the people. Johnston Elementary School is where the young learn their letters and numbers until such time they must travel to the next town for further schooling.\n\nNo parks grace this place, though plans are afoot to carve out a space for families, a 2.5-acre hope for the future. The town lacks theaters and alleys of bowling, lacks places for children to play or for folks to gather. Yet there is a quiet charm to it, a simplicity that might be missed if you blink as you pass through, but for those who stop long enough to see, Johnston is a place where the world slows and one can breathe.",
            "In the heart of a small southern town in Tennessee, I dwell in a modest suburb. A street that stretches between two state highways, it draws more traffic than one might hope for, yet the neighborhood holds its quietude like a secret. The folks here, they don’t come and go much. I've come to know the rhythm of their lives, the hum of their daily labors, the yardwork that keeps them occupied. Winter finds us sledding down the hill on our side street, a brief, cold reprieve from the sameness of days. Our house sits at the corner, a sentinel that watches over all who pass by. Familiarity breeds with each car that rolls by, though a stranger's vehicle is noted with a certain curiosity. \n\nSome neighbors take to walking, a habit of health or necessity, dogs in tow. Children weave through the quiet on their bicycles. We, too, are at home more often than not, the nature of our work binding us to this place. My wife and I, along with our daughters, ages eleven and fourteen, have woven ourselves into the fabric of this street’s daily life. We venture out for play, unbothered by rain. The grill on the back deck sends up smoke and scent, a signal of small happiness. And there is the ever-present sound of lawn mowers from spring till the grass ceases its growth in October. Trees abound, remnants of an older forest, granting shade in summer and a cascade of leaves in fall, demanding the annual ritual of rake and burn. The scent of burning leaves, it’s the harbinger of autumn’s arrival.\n\nWinter has been scarce of late, stretching the fall into a long, unbroken pause. Our garage faces the back, so the front door sees little use unless a visitor calls, a rarity. I occupy myself with tasks in the garage, the truck and other projects, and with doors open, I feel the pulse of the neighborhood. Holidays pass quietly, Thanksgiving bringing a scattering of distant kin and their vehicles, a similar scene on Mother’s Day and Christmas. This place, I find a fondness for it. Were it not for the cars that hurry through, it might be nigh unto perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert sits a neighborhood of dust and earth, where the land stretches barren and brown under a relentless sun. Those who have not walked its parched ground cannot fathom the oppression of such a monochrome world, save for the rare oasis of green where a man has surrendered riches to coax life from the soil. When I first came here in the nineties, the houses were scattered far and wide, a testament to solitude. Even now, with the new structures rising, the essence remains. The sprawl speaks of a city, yet it mirrors the change found in all places. People here bear warmth in their hearts, though shadows linger as in any town. My own corner of this desert is surrounded by kindly elders, marking it a refuge of sorts. The commerce of this place is dominated by familiar names, chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For the finer things, one must journey afar, for Whole Foods and their ilk are strangers here. Construction reigns in the trade of men, for this city is a canvas yet to be filled, its expanses inviting the hand of progress. This prospect unsettles me, for I cherish the present state, having fled the clamor of a metropolis and unwilling to return. I labor in this field, a craftsman of drywall and T-bar, marking my days with the rhythm of creation.\n\nYet the land holds its own allure, a sanctuary for creatures adapted to its harsh embrace. The desert's stark beauty draws souls seeking its truth, its challenging ecosystems demanding respect for coexistence. We, too, have found our place among the wild things, my children captivated by lizards and the myriad insects of the sands. Even as I write, their laughter echoes outside as they pursue their quarry. Our town offers its diversions, a taste of adventure in the embrace of Victorville. It is a haven for families, the desert unfolding its mysteries. Plan to visit when the San Bernardino County Fair enlivens the air, offering a Victorville welcome. Venture to nearby Wrightwood, where snow-capped peaks promise lessons in winter's arts. For those drawn to the origins of this land, the Victor Valley Museum stands with its relics of geology and ancient peoples, chronicling the tale of Victorville's rise from the dust.",
            "In the telling of my neighborhood, I reckon my answer might strike as peculiar. Where others might speak of picket fences and lawns, I speak of a place more transient and yet, for a time, eternal. The college campus where I bide my days, it is the land I call home, and the souls within the dormitory walls, they are my kin. Beyond them lies the campus, which sprawls like a yard untamed, a neighborhood in its own right, though lesser and more diffuse.\n\nYet here lies the truth of it: my neighborhood, though strange, is not so unlike those places people call home. It has its own houses, its own people, its own shops and parks. Let me take you through the houses that stand in this peculiar quarter. Three sorts there are—apartments, true houses, and those dormitory halls. In the apartments, they stack folk two or four to a chamber, with four to six chambers a floor. Two stories they rise, and twenty souls they hold, give or take.\n\nThen there are the houses, proper homes for those bound to the school, mostly alumni, who dwell within their two to four room confines. But scarce are these, scattered few across the land, for they are not efficient. Last, there are the dormitories—long corridors lined with rooms where hundreds of students abide. In each, two share a space, for the most part, and these dorms are the heart of my neighborhood.\n\nNow with the houses spoken for, let us turn to the people. The school takes pride in its diversity, and it is here, in the faces you meet in the halls and on the paths. From all lands and ages they come, making this place a tapestry of the world. The staff, they find shelter in the scattered houses, while new students fill the dorms and the older ones take to the apartments.\n\nAs for the stores and the parks, these too are part of my world. The campus is a town unto itself, with a bounty of shops and one lone park. There are places to eat, as there are in any town, and stores with the school’s own wares. In this neighborhood, whatever you seek is within reach. The park, a small respite, is a haven where all gather, kept clean and safe by the hands of those who dwell here.",
            "In the place where I reside, sidewalks are few and far between. The land falls away, giving itself to gravity, and my dwelling stands at the pinnacle of the steepest incline that the local folk know as the \"work out hill,\" for it beckons those who seek to test their mettle upon its slope. No sidewalks grace our street, so the people walk upon the asphalt, where the road is rough-hewn and treacherous to traverse. The wires of telephone and electric strung overhead hang in tatters, battered by the gales and storms that sweep through our land, leaving branches and debris to fell them time and again, their repair a patchwork quilt of human endeavor. Towering evergreens cast their long shadows all around, yet they are not cherished. No, the folk here wield their axes against them, for they covet the view of the sea, unbroken and vast. Thus, the houses rise high upon the hillside, glass-fronted and lofty, seeking the bay's embrace. At day's end, the sun kindles the water, and the heavens burn with orange, though oftentimes the clouds conspire to shroud that celestial fire. The days are gray and wet, and moss clings to all it can, to roofs and cars and railings alike. Once, I left my automobile idle in the drive for a month, and when I returned, it wore a green and furry coat of moss that took three hours to scrape clean. Here, children are scarce, though a school lies but a few blocks distant. My neighbors are mostly of the older sort, many having surrendered to retirement. In place of children, they keep dogs. You’ll see them lounging on lawns or racing down the street, and woe to those who leave a door or window ajar, for the dogs will venture in unbidden. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it back out. Rabbits run rampant, too, some well-sized, much to the chagrin of the gardeners, who curse their burrows and their plundering of roots. My cats, they delight in the chase and have driven most rabbits from our midst. Birds are plentiful, flitting sparrows and hummingbirds, and now and then a hawk or eagle will appear, only to be chased away by the crows that rule the sky. Shops do not dwell here, but down the hill at the water’s edge, a few eateries serve the bounty of the sea. The beach is scant, but the rocks along the shore are fit for casting into the depths, and the bay is narrow; you can glimpse the far shore even through the mist that clings like a shroud most days.",
            "If you find yourself bound for Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, know that you will not struggle to find your way. The city’s arteries of steel and rail run deep and wide, carrying the masses to and fro with the ceaseless clamor of New York’s own breath. Bensonhurst stands proudly urban, its streets echoing the same rhythms that pulse through the heart of the city itself. And as you wander those streets, your eyes will fall upon the myriad Asian shops that have taken root. In the passing of two decades, the neighborhood has welcomed an influx of Asian souls, their presence marked by the scent of spice and the hum of commerce. Every block tells the tale, a testament to the supermarkets and laundromats that dot the landscape, serving the people with the nourishment they seek and the cleanliness they crave. The food is good, the prices fair, and the convenience unrivaled. Just beyond where I stand, four Asian markets lie clustered within two minutes' walk of each other, each a beacon of sustenance.\n\nYet do not let it be said that Bensonhurst is solely a haven for the Asian community. It is a mosaic, diverse and sprawling, with immigrants and their children, first and second generation, weaving the rich tapestry of life here. The businesses, large and small, speak of Asian ownership, yet they coexist alongside a recently renewed park, a refuge of play and sport. There, the earth is marked with ten basketball courts, a broad field for soccer or baseball, and courts for handball, swings, and a playground for the young ones. Even a fountain stands to bring joy in the heat of summer. The park is a testament to the city’s diversity, where all manner of folk gather and find common ground.\n\nThe skyline here is not pierced by the monoliths of corporate ambition, but rather by dwellings of cooperative living and condominium stature. Predominantly, it is a place of two-family homes, where life unfolds with a certain clatter. The people are kind, though their voices are loud. The air is filled with the roar of engines and the thrum of music as cars pass by, relentless and waking the dawn. Should your visit find you beneath the night’s cloak, be wary. The neighborhood, though safe, is unpredictable as the city’s own soul. Trouble may arise unbidden, in the form of bullies or thieves. I have felt it myself in years past, the sting of assault, and more recently, the theft of parcels. Such is the way of things. And though the city demands cleanliness, the rule is oft ignored. The morning light reveals the neglect, the dog waste that mars the path to the train or the market. It is a vexation, an affront to the senses, and one must tread carefully to keep their shoes unsullied.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, a town known to some as a bastion of oddity, there lies a truth about the very notion of \"weird.\" Scrawled upon the brick of a building that harbors a pizza joint, bar, music hall, and strip club, a phrase boldly declares, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To the few who remember, it calls back to the Portland of another time, a place less exposed to the world, where creativity roamed untethered in the shadows of the 90s and early 2000s. To others, it is a siren’s song, a lure to a city where the label of weird is worn like a medal of honor. Despite the tide of Californians with their gilded pockets and the rise of glass towers to shelter them, Portland remains untamed. Weirdness here does not always mean open arms, but rather an embrace of the unorthodox. It does not shun modernity, nor its struggles. Like the rest of the nation, we trade with the far East, our goods shipped from China’s distant shores. There are countless ways to be strange, to deviate from the norm, yet Portland holds its share of the mundane. It has yoga studios, hipsters, and men in suits. Perhaps being weird is simply to gaze upon all this with a wry smile. In my part of town, as in many corners of Portland, houses stand adorned in hues of the rainbow, gardens spill their bounty onto the sidewalk, and free boxes appear with the sun. These boxes, often simple cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold within them the magic of serendipity, offering treasures to the passerby. They brim with clothes, books, and sometimes the unexpected. This simple wonder of wandering the streets of Southeast Portland is the essence of the city, at least to me, though I am but one peculiar soul among many. Among us are those who would never dream of fetching garments from a box left on the curb. These folks linger at goat yoga—yes, the mats shared with bleating companions—or cheer at Timbers matches. Portland is a mosaic of passions, of dreams pursued or merely contemplated over drinks in dimly lit bars. It harbors a malaise of substances, a shadow cast by the mind’s turmoil, perhaps nurtured by the unending rain and the oppressive gray of the sky. Homelessness is another specter that haunts the city, a dilemma unsolved, despite the services that outshine much of the nation. The housed oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this, Portland is not so peculiar after all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal, ever present in the north, bearing silent witness to the sun's pilgrimage at dawn and dusk. No matter the forgetfulness of men or the ceaseless pace of their lives, they remain steadfast, untouched by the brief tribulations that consume us. And on those days when the weight of the world bears down and the soul strains under its yoke, the mountains call out with a quiet insistence. They compel the eyes to look upon them, and in that gaze, there comes a balm for the anxious spirit, a quiet fortitude to endure another day. I came to this land as a young scholar, my heart and mind drawn to the mountains that stood sentinel to the north of the campus. The university, with its grand buildings and serene ponds, has its own allure, but it is the mountains that hold dominion over my heart. The town itself carries a humble beauty. Countless cafés have played host to hours of study beneath the caffeinated haze. One can wander or take the bus to the heart of the town, where the faded bricks of restaurants and offices whisper tales of old. Here, this suburban place hums with the vigor of its urban neighbor, though the thrumming energy fades as you pass the library and find yourself once more in the quiet embrace of small-town life. This juxtaposition of worlds, so close yet distinct, lends the city a mysterious charm, beckoning the curious to explore its depths. Thus, it is easy to craft memories, each tied to a corner of the town. Be it the rusted swings in the park swaying in the night wind or the race through the bustling streets to catch a film at the grand theater. Yet, as with all places, it holds its share of harsh memories. The ponds, reflections of the soul, serve as sanctuaries for solitude or tears shed in the hours when time seems to stand still. Here, in the company of turtles and ducks and insects, all fulfilling their purpose, I ponder my own role in this vast enigma called life. I walk past the pond, past the park, past the houses that breathe suburbia, until the street unfurls before me. The sun casts its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky with its brilliance, and I realize my footsteps take me northward. And there, as always, are the mountains. Majestic and unwavering, they brush against the sky, a testament to endurance that speaks to the heart without uttering a word.",
            "It might escape your notice at first, the way things do when they are not meant to be seen or when they hide in plain sight. A residential sprawl tucked behind the commerce of consumption and need, a place you'd not likely reckon to find folks calling home. Yet if you venture past the derelict Whole Foods and sidle beyond the yearly occupied hotels, their empty rooms waiting for summer kin, you’ll come upon a living, breathing world. Streets unfurl with quiet purpose, and there lie clusters of apartment complexes, each one nestled against the other like Russian dolls dismantled and laid side by side in a deliberate line. The first of these has made the news, whispered tales of ill repute, but such talk is just smoke in the wind. There is more to see, more to know, in the apartments beyond, where life unfolds unbeknownst to the wider world.\n\nAcross from these homes of concrete and glass stands a community college's outpost, a sentinel of learning where students trickle in, clutching coffee and yawns, to greet the morning’s reluctant dawn. The gates groan open in greeting, and students slip through like ghosts, while drivers curse the delay, the inconvenience of it all. The road bends and breaks into another, flanked by a park and a place where broken bones find healing. The rehabilitation center stands with an air of cheer, its porch adorned with furniture and a fan that stirs the heavy summer air in lazy circles.\n\nChildren dance in the park, their limbs flailing in wild abandon, a blur of movement on the green, while bees hover above the flowers, drunk on the sun. Old souls shuffle with their dogs along the path, casting disapproving eyes at the skaters and nodding with soft approval at the young girls who gather to spin tales of boys and fleeting fame. Nearby, a sushi joint offers its wares, its tables never too crowded, while a place to buy swimming supplies and a nail salon sit in patient company. Here, the strip mall promises convenience, a trifecta of pleasure and necessity, where one might indulge in a manicure, a meal, and pool accouterments in one fell swoop. And there’s a frozen yogurt shop too, where teenagers come to cool their tongues and pretend at wisdom, cups of sweetness in hand as they weave across the pavement on their boards, smoke curling from their lips, believing it all to be the height of rebellion. This neighborhood is a tapestry of the American South, where the slow march of time barely registers, and life continues in its unchanging dance.",
            "The neighborhood stands in quiet witness to a bygone era. Houses, mostly singular in their countenance, stand like silent sentinels, though a few have been cleaved into twain yet remain conjoined, if such a thing makes sense. Before my abode, a modest patch of land lies, and to its flank, a narrow drive. These homes, like echoes of another time, speak of dreams once held dear beneath the vast, indifferent sky. The dream of suburbia, an American vision now slipping through grasping fingers, yet still these streets endure, whispering to all who pass that the dream yet breathes, and we cling to its fading promise.\n\nThe folk here, they do not brim with the optimism of yesteryear. The little plots of green are not tended as they once were, but still, there are cars resting in the drives, still the young ones heedless in their play, as if the world beyond were but a distant rumor. The old school, near ninety years standing, still looms, nurturing the young while stirring memory in the aged hearts. Churches stand scattered, more often empty than filled, yet the basketball courts echo with life. The homes, each with its own face, share a soul.\n\nA vast market, Super A, sits under the watchful eye of a Yemeni clan, perhaps the sole Arabs here, amidst a sea of African American neighbors. The streets stretch wide where children play football, only halting when the rumble of cars intrudes. Generations have passed through these streets, each with tales of a time when all knew all. A karate school once thrived here, until the allure waned with the silencing of Hollywood's tales of karate kids. Now it stands as a pharmacy, a place where remedies are promised, or so it is said.\n\nA humble cinema persists, offering old films at a price that draws the elders, nostalgic for simpler nights, while the young seek elsewhere. An expressway cuts near, though its entrance lies just beyond our reach. Once, a petition sought to bring it closer, the youth in favor, the elders wary. In the end, it was the elders' voices that stilled the city council’s hand, fearing it would mar the town's essence. A new high school rises, and with it, the question of a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin might capture the spirit of this place.",
            "In the sprawl of this city where I make my home, the neighborhood unfolds like a quilt of manifold hues. The streets weave through a patchwork of residences and commerce, the latter bustling with offices and stores, eateries and places where folk find their mirth. The air is thick with the scent of new restaurants, each vying for the palate, and shops where one might find anything their heart desires. There are the great monoliths of commerce, the brands whose names carry weight, and yet these are flanked by the small boutiques, each with its own whispering allure. They stand in the malls and line the streets, close enough to the quiet enclaves of homes that one might hear the murmur of city life at their threshold.\n\nParks stand as islands amidst the urban sea, where the laughter of children mingles with the rustle of leaves. And the people here, they are as varied as the sky at dawn. Within a stone's throw, you find the vibrant communities of LGBTQ+ folks, the devout Orthodox Jews, and those who have journeyed from the lands of the once mighty Soviet Union. Beyond this small realm, the city stretches further into enclaves of every kind. There is a Korea town, a China town, a Little Armenia, all within a scant few miles, though those miles can stretch into hours when the roads are choked with the gridlock of human endeavor.\n\nFew walk in this city, for the distances are vast and the streets unfriendly to the pedestrian. The traffic is a beast with no master, and parking a prize hard won. Yet the city grows, ever taller and denser, as new apartments rise from the earth. This place draws folk like a beacon, and with them come more cars to clog the arteries of the city. Houses here are a tapestry of forms, from the single-family homes to the duplexes that share their walls. In my own corner of this metropolis, the homes stand varied and diverse, much like the people who dwell within them.\n\nThe faces here are many, the ages varied, though it is a lonesome truth that I know few of those who live beside me. The bonds of community have loosened, though I hold dear the memories of days spent in the company of neighbors, the laughter of children echoing in the warmth of the sunlit streets. The city, vast and sprawling, has changed, yet it holds within it the echoes of what once was.",
            "Where is everything, she asked, as we rolled past those endless cornfields that stretched out to meet the sky. This is it, I said, knowing the expanse would lay her soul bare. She came from a place where the grocer's was a mere five-minute walk, and she had never laid eyes on so much unbroken ground. Awash in the vastness, I told her of a life grown in rural Ohio, and in that telling, she saw the shadow of who I was and the soil from which I had sprung. We drove the narrow road, a ribbon of asphalt that wound to a quarry brimming with water, and there beyond lay the little settlement I called home. The houses were brick and stucco, each spread with half an acre of earth that folks tended as their own. Spring would find the land awash in flowers planted new each year, trees in their midwestern dress changing with the seasons. Driveways flaunted their luxury, Mercedes Benzes catching the midday sun like jewels. As we neared my gray stucco abode, my Korean neighbor stood in his yard, ever smiling. He passed his days with the mower, a song rising over its hum. The neighborhood found humor in him, but he was sincere and rich in his tales. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and his John Deere as if part of the ground itself. At last, you would come to my door. The side yard teemed with geese, ever pursued by the terrier. Behind, a slender stream fed into the quarry, where bullfrogs sang and the far-off low of cattle reached the ear. Across a bridge of hand-hewn wood lay a sanctuary untouched, where trees grew wild and herbs and flowers flourished. That was the world of my youth. Building forts in trees and the chase of imagined prey filled our days, always another child for company. Winters here could be cruel in their cold, yet possessed a beauty unmatched. The yard's green turned to a white wilderness. The trees, once flushed with color, stood as bare-boned sentinels. When snow came, the world transformed overnight. Snow angels made by my sister adorned the yard, snowmen too. We were fierce in our play, snowballs the weapons of our quarrels. We built igloos with branches, an armory of our own. In that frozen world, we lived in pretend, two children without a care. The world beyond was naught but a distant echo, and we were free."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America lies a small town in Michigan, where the road stretches from vast farmlands to quaint tourist cities. It is a place devoid of sprawling malls or the bright lights of Wal-mart, Target, or even the humble glow of an Applebee’s. Here, the open land demands you drive to your destination, yet it is a place of untouched beauty, wrapped in the embrace of water. My town, if you can call it that, finds itself nestled between the grand expanse of Lake Michigan and the serene waters of Lake Charlevoix. Shores stretch out, inviting the weary to rest their feet in the cool embrace of the sand and surf.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks in the quiet tongue of small-town life. Houses stand apart, not the uniformity of modernity but relics of a bygone era, some tended to with care, others left to the ravages of time. Full basements peer from beneath the ground along the streets, and aluminum siding glints under the sun. The spectrum of home colors paints the blocks in a myriad of hues, each with a yard where children’s laughter echoes from trampolines and playsets. Gardens grow in the care of those who tend to them, fences keep the animals safe. It is the visage of Middle America, where laboring hands strive to carve out a living, nurturing the young or reflecting on the past.\n\nIn this place, the streets are alive with the patter of children’s feet, the bark of a dog, the hum of bicycles and rollerblades. Neighbors nod in recognition, a silent understanding of who belongs. A grill sends up smoke as a friendly wave passes between strangers, a smile exchanged from afar. Lawns are kept neat, leaves banished, the grass a verdant carpet beneath the feet. It may not be a neighborhood that inspires awe, but it is a sanctuary, a haven for families to grow and find their peace. The quiet speaks volumes; it is a place of safety, a refuge at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s department stands watch, the health department its neighbor, and the recycling center serves the community’s needs. The crack of bat against ball echoes from fields where children play, their names called out by unseen voices. And the small town airport, where the roar of engines shatters the silence, planes climbing into the open sky. Ice cream waits within walking distance, a sweet reward for those who venture downtown. Eight blocks away, the park welcomes my children’s bikes. It is a place of simple joys and unassuming grace, a good place to call home.",
            "In the land where the houses stand in neat rows like sentinels of some forgotten order, there lies the neighborhood that wears the face of the commonplace. A suburbia wrought by the hand of uniformity, sculpted under the stern eye of the homeowner's association. Upon entry, you are greeted by the unyielding symmetry of manicured lawns and homes that whisper the same secrets, each with a patch of green, some stones scattered like the memories of lost landscapes, and driveways that stretch briefly from street to home. The trees, sparse and deliberate, stand as if planted by some ancient decree. Each domicile boasts a garage for two, a testament to the lives within.\n\nAs you traverse this place, the roads, smooth as a river's stone, bear no blemish nor scar. The asphalt, unmarked by time's passage, speaks of a relentless upkeep that defies the entropy of the world beyond. The houses, mostly of a single story, rise occasionally to two, breaking the horizon like the quiet rise of a thought unspoken. Mailboxes do not stand solitary at the curb but gather at the street's end in a cluster, a congregation of metal that demands a key for entry, parcels held in lockers as if secrets kept by the community itself.\n\nThe boundary of this neighborhood lies at the edge of the city's reach, a place where the rural and the suburban converge, giving rise to expanses of land that invite the wanderer to walk its paths. Pools, gated and pristine, lie in wait for those who seek solace in their waters. Trails wind through the community, offering the promise of solitude or the company of a faithful hound at one's side. Here, exercise needs no park, for the neighborhood is vast enough to hold your running feet.\n\nThe souls who dwell here are mostly those who have seen the seasons turn many times, retirees who watch over one another with a quiet vigilance. Yet, among them, the young professionals and the middle-aged find their place, adding their stories to the tapestry of life here. The city nearby, a paradox of size and intimacy, offers its bounty of amenities. A single mall stands as the heart of commerce, modest in size but sufficient to the needs of those who seek its wares. Fifteen minutes by car will take you to any place of note, where high-end grocers share space with outlets of frugality, each with their own tale to tell.\n\nAnd so this place, safe and tended with care, holds within it the trappings of a familiar life. The pools and trails, the order and the quiet, all speak of a world crafted for comfort. Though the shopping lies a journey away, it is but a small price for the peace this land bestows.",
            "The first I’d heard of the place was listening to some broadcast about lost souls. It caught me off guard, unexpected like. Every flat around here runs up past a thousand a month and nobody ever spoke of such tales, not to me or any of the folks I knew. Maybe it’s the struggle. I know some who cry themselves to sleep, though they won’t say it. The cost of things bears down hard but we’ve learned to scrape by. You come to embrace the scent of old toys and clothes kept from the moths. You find yourself smelling less as the years weigh in. Maybe you take up smoking or maybe you just grow used to the way of things. But the flea market stands its ground. The odor of grown days is dusty stacks of magazines on a silent piano. It settles in the leather and stays there even after washing. Around here, three thrift stores lie within strolling distance. Start on the far side and you’ll see two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book shop, and a curio store. Downtown’s tight with cars and bodies, filling the streets at dawn, but you’d never hear them in the thrifts. No matter the passing crowd or traffic, the place holds its hush. It’s a fine spot to let the afternoon slip away. Each year brings more of those. Cars and people flood the city. They say it’s growing, a city in the throes of change. Headquartering a vast online empire for commerce and delivery, still showing the ache of growth. It calls to mind New York. Every soul bent on their own path, not much asked of you. Alone you can be, quiet, independent, and the world leaves you be. Not like the South, where concern shows you care. Here, no life is pried into. You keep your shell as long as you need, and the city rolls back like the tide. Lively place. With a pianist next door and two singers upstairs, there’s always something stirring. In some sense, it’s less a flat of strangers and more a kinship of friends. We gather for needs, mark birthdays, mourn farewells, lend a hand where we can. Lucky to be here, I reckon. Neighbors mostly good folk, and they treat me right. I clean up, leave them food, and they do the same. Carry mail back and forth. Nice to see them, and I think they find my company pleasing as well. I dwell in this vast, cold modern sprawl yet it’s folks like my neighbors that make me think I ain’t gone and wrecked my life.",
            "In the heartland where the land sprawls out like an old quilt, patched and mended, there lies a town caught on the edge of the city’s reach, where the concrete gives way to fields and the promise of quiet. I make my home on the eastern side of this town, a place where the dollar stretches thin and the roofs sit low under the weight of time. The houses, humble in their wearing, stand as if in quiet defiance, occupied by those who find their footing on the margins. Yet the streets are not without their grace, and the folks here, they nod and tip their hats, a silent kinship exchanged among strangers.\n\nThe specter of crime lingers at the edges, a whispered tale of the past decade: a scattering of violence, the crack of a gunshot in the night, the grief of a mother next door whose boy fell to the dark outside a bar. We’ve been spared, mostly, save for a trinket or two vanished from the porch when the dusk cloaks the world. The town bears the scars of a greater curse, an epidemic of powdered despair that steals breath and life, fentanyl its name, carving holes in families and futures. Yet here, against the tide, rise centers of hope, places of healing, where Narcan finds its way into hands ready to save.\n\nAmidst the trials, the town stands resilient, its virtues steadfast. My son finds sanctuary in the schoolhouse, where the walls echo with laughter and learning, untouched by cruelty despite the challenges he bears. The teachers, the principal, they form a bastion of goodwill and care, ushering each child with a gentle hand. The PTO breathes life into the halls, crafting moments of joy and togetherness. Poverty casts its shadow, yet no child feels its chill; meals are given freely, dignity preserved.\n\nThe council speaks of progress, their hands busy with the town’s face-lift, though their gaze seldom shifts eastward. Here on our side, the roads remain cracked, the parks overgrown, promises whispered but not kept, a thorn in the side of those who call this place home. Yet in spite of it all, I find solace here. The people, they are kind; the shops, sufficient; the life, enough. Our home, its worth measured not in gold but in comfort, stands as testament to sixteen years of roots sunk deep into this soil. And here, in this town, we remain, unable to picture a life beyond its borders.",
            "The neighborhood sprawls across the hill like some ancient thing, its bones wrapped in a shroud of history, buildings stacked with tales long told. I make my home in a seven-story edifice that stands sentinel across from the old theater where echoes linger. Down the slope, a block away, there's a small arcade bar where souls gather, drawn into its warmth like moths to a flame on summer's breath. On those nights, lines snake along the pavement, a testament to the life that pulses here.\n\nA few blocks further, the city park unfolds itself, a vast expanse of green framed by stone and concrete, steps hewn into its sides like scars. In the cold grip of winter, the homeless set their tents in rows, a testament to the struggle against the chill and the rain that falls relentless from a brooding sky. They huddle close, seeking warmth and solace in the heart of the city, not out in the wilderness where the jungle waits. The family center, a beacon of respite, lies within reach, offering the gift of warmth and water.\n\nYet it is not the storied architecture or the whispers of history that bind me to this place. It is the people, the culture that throbs within. Hilltop, once a name feared, a place of violence and dark tales, still breathes its stories. The streets remember the sweep of authority, the cleansing that left only memories behind. The people hold onto these tales, passing them down like heirlooms, marking the passage of time and change.\n\nThey labor still to cleanse their streets, to nurture their home. They speak of caution, of danger after dark, warnings flavored by the past, by the fears that linger. Perhaps my skin, shaded just enough, finds acceptance here, or perhaps they see in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the weight of history's burden, the shadows cast by ignorance and fear. This city, a supposed haven of diversity, still struggles with the ghosts of division.\n\nYet the Hilltop is my anchor, my home. In its embrace, I walk the night, alive and unafraid. Here, kindness finds me more often than malice. Strangers offer warmth where coldness might dwell. Laundromats remain open, their lights a refuge against the storm. And on the bleakest of nights, I find myself seen, valued by the tender act of a stranger’s hand.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when words fell flat against the hardness of new faces. Friends were hard to find. I found them nonetheless, a boy two doors down and another further along the street. They've long since moved, but the echoes of our days never left. Most folks who were here when I arrived remain as if time has held them in its quiet embrace. The place is like any other stretch of suburban America, two-story houses standing watch over their little plots of earth. Come the weekend or any warm day, the air fills with the laughter of children, yet the quiet holds its dominion through the week. There's a peace here, an understanding that a man is left to his own unless he seeks aid. Packages arrive on the doorstep and stay unmolested, a testament to the trust that binds the neighbors.\n\nA park lies a minute's walk from my door, a small green world of memory. There, I played basketball and football, the crack of the bat echoing in the evenings. It was there, too, that I took an elbow to the nose, a painful reminder that not all memories are sweet, yet the good far outweigh the bad. Now, when I wander that way, it is with my cousin's young ones, their eyes bright with the thrill of swings and slides. That park stirs something deep, a well of nostalgia that flows unbidden.\n\nThe neighborhood, a tapestry of faces and flavors. Within a mile, the scents of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian fare mingle in the air. Yet the world shifts, and convenience rules the day. GrubHub and DoorDash ferry meals to doorsteps, though the golden arches still beckon as they do in every suburb. Pizza abounds, a staple of American life. The stores, they offer all one might need. Dry cleaners dot the area, and there's a Walgreens and a CVS standing sentinel on the same street. Jewel-Osco, a beacon of the Midwest, serves the community's needs. Even diversity finds its place, an Indian-owned store offering spices and meals to those who seek them.\n\nIn all, I hold my neighborhood dear. The tales of neighborly strife that ripple across the digital world make me thankful for the peace that surrounds me. Here, in this quiet solace, I find contentment.",
            "The place where I live rests close by to the college I attend, and for this reason I find some contentment in dwelling there. The neighborhood is a patchwork of apartment buildings, with a scattering of eateries and bars that offer diversion without draining the purse too severely. One bar has taken on a new name, and with it, a heftier price, though its offerings and service aren't the worst one might find. The populace is generally of a decent sort. You'll find college youth mingling with those of humbler means, drawn by the affordability of the housing. Children abound, owing to the elementary school within a stone's throw from my abode. The neighbors remain strangers to me, and I prefer it so. They indulge in the smoking of weed, prompting the management to install an air freshener by their door, which my boyfriend and I found amusing to the point of insult. The buildings around me bear the marks of age, though some may conceal renovated hearts. Further down the way stand newly minted apartments, but I hold them in low regard, knowing the shoddy craftsmanship that raised them. They charge dear for rent, a swindle made permissible by their proximity to the campus. There's a nearby eatery, cheap and cheerful, serving its fare on paper plates and warming meals by microwave. Across from it lies a gas station, reputedly a poor place of employment. Yet last summer saw the city bestow funds to refurbish the road, laying down a broad sidewalk with green medians, lending the area a touch of grace. My apartment is cloaked in trees, though a few have been felled, leaving stumps like gravestones. More trees shade my street than the road beyond. Behind my complex lies a tree line, then another spread of apartments. I reside on 42nd street; 43rd looms behind, less comely with sidewalks crumbling and buildings in disrepair. Trees line this street as if to hide its blemishes. Crime finds a home in a nearby complex and across the way, where residents come and go like whispers on the wind. Yet I find some fondness for where I dwell. It's within my means, and the conveniences it offers are ample. The university is but a short walk, and two bus stops grant swift passage to the store and downtown.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawled across the cul-de-sac like a tale half-told, duplexes scattered with the care of a child's hand arranging a toy village. Each building stood painted in a uniform yellow, with white porches and green roofs of metal that gleamed in the sun, giving them an appearance of singular homes though they were not. In this cluster of sameness, a kinship had formed among most, though not all, neighbors. As the day waned, we gathered, unbidden, at the end of a driveway to exchange words that floated on the warm air while children played out their own worlds with chalk and kites beneath a sky vast and blue, the clouds drifting like old ships in calm seas. It was here, in this place, that the noise of the modern world receded, a step back into a time less hurried.\n\nBeyond us lay fields and trees, their green depths touched by the sky's endless blue. But with the season came the threat of storms, and the night before had brought the wail of tornado sirens, the first I'd ever heard. We sought shelter, and I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog and a purse filled with the little comforts of life, as the larger one barked his fear to the quiet room from the living room. The storm passed, leaving the ground littered with hail that sang its cold song as it melted away. The air, suddenly cool, steamed from the heat it had known moments before. In the aftermath, as the sun broke through and rain fell from a clearing sky, a double rainbow arced above, a promise painted in light. I seized my camera, captured the scene, and shared it with those who would marvel at such wonders, as did I. The street lay silent still, until life resumed its steady pace, mothers and children emerging as the evening meal cooked inside.\n\nI had come here, a stranger from the north, to find a community that spoke in a tongue soft with the southern drawl, a two-bedroom apartment like the others yet distinct within. Some were small, defying reason, but mine was a good fit. Behind stretched a vast field, and beyond that a pond where deer wandered and bullfrogs sang in the dawn. It was a place that felt remote, yet lay but forty minutes from the city of Charlotte. Roosters heralded the mornings, their calls mingling with the bray of a distant donkey, a reminder of the farms that circled us like sentinels of a bygone era. Here, in this corner of the world, I had found a place to call home.",
            "I reckon it's been near a decade I've walked these streets and breathed the air that fills this place. A soul can't help but gather tales to tell. When I first set foot in this neighborhood, sorrow was my shadow. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and the leaving tore me up inside. I cried for the days left behind, the faces I loved. My folks, they sought a better life for me and my sister. So we moved, chasing better houses and finer schools, places folks called not ghetto. As time unspooled, I grew accustomed to the new horizon. Made friends, made enemies too, in the halls of that school. The neighbors, they stayed distant save for Mr. Glen and his kin and Dennis, who lived right nearby. They became family in ways unspoken, and I hold them dear. I recall the day when me and my kin went to Mr. Glen’s wedding—his re-marrying. Joyful it was, a harbinger of dreams I keep for myself, to one day shower my own bride with the life of royalty. When Ms. Veda tossed that white garter, it was my hand that caught it. But the flowers eluded me. We danced till the stars blinked out, and I remember the laughter shared with Marsharii, but she's a ghost now, gone on her way. The neighborhood itself is a labyrinth, but with a GPS in hand, I wander its paths. I've ventured far only with Kason and Curtis, comrades in games and in life. We reveled in the simple things, the fleeting joys of youth. At times, I'd find solace in the park, nature's balm on a restless spirit. With sticks from the Home Depot, I'd practice balance, wield my bokken wooden sword. It's a joy that remains untouched by time. There's a court for basketball and tennis too, though it's been a spell since I laid hand to racket or ball. My dad, he nurtured a love for tennis in me and my friend alongside Mr. Graves, who pushed us hard, but we laughed all the way through. This place holds a tapestry of memories, and while many stories dwell here, these are the ones that linger, whispering of the promise the future holds untold.",
            "The town lies quiet beneath the Carolina sun, a modest settlement not marked by grandeur but by the silent labor of its fields. Johnston, they call it, the Peach Capital of the World, and the sign at the edge of it declares this proudly to any who might pass by. Farmland stretches out from the heart of the town, where peach trees stand in orderly rows and cattle dot the landscape like slow-moving shadows. Homes scatter themselves across this expanse, solitary and spaced, two-story structures with roofs of metal or gray shingle to beat back the heat of a relentless summer. They sit back from the road, yielding the front lands to the hands of farmers and the tread of beasts.\n\nIn the town’s small core, a single stoplight dangles above the crossroads, marking the place where commerce takes what little root it can. There are but a few places to find a meal prepared for you—Hong Kong, a family-run Chinese kitchen, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger joint. A pizzeria once graced this town, but it shuttered its doors in the recent past. Maxwell and Halford Drug stands, a tiny pharmacy with a reputation more for its Cherry Coca-Cola than its remedies. The Independent Grocers Alliance, known simply as IGA, is the lone grocery store, but many make the journey to Batesburg-Leesville’s Walmart for their larger needs. Dollar General is the lifeblood of the town’s commerce, its aisles crowded from dawn to dusk with those seeking the essentials of life.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More sits under the stewardship of a kind-hearted woman, her store a fixture of the community with two men employed to deliver the wares. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town’s pets with care, offering grooming and shelter in equal measure. A doctor’s office and a veterinary practice both lie beyond the town’s center, small yet sufficient to the needs of the people. Johnston Elementary School is where the young learn their letters and numbers until such time they must travel to the next town for further schooling.\n\nNo parks grace this place, though plans are afoot to carve out a space for families, a 2.5-acre hope for the future. The town lacks theaters and alleys of bowling, lacks places for children to play or for folks to gather. Yet there is a quiet charm to it, a simplicity that might be missed if you blink as you pass through, but for those who stop long enough to see, Johnston is a place where the world slows and one can breathe.",
            "In the heart of a small southern town in Tennessee, I dwell in a modest suburb. A street that stretches between two state highways, it draws more traffic than one might hope for, yet the neighborhood holds its quietude like a secret. The folks here, they don’t come and go much. I've come to know the rhythm of their lives, the hum of their daily labors, the yardwork that keeps them occupied. Winter finds us sledding down the hill on our side street, a brief, cold reprieve from the sameness of days. Our house sits at the corner, a sentinel that watches over all who pass by. Familiarity breeds with each car that rolls by, though a stranger's vehicle is noted with a certain curiosity. \n\nSome neighbors take to walking, a habit of health or necessity, dogs in tow. Children weave through the quiet on their bicycles. We, too, are at home more often than not, the nature of our work binding us to this place. My wife and I, along with our daughters, ages eleven and fourteen, have woven ourselves into the fabric of this street’s daily life. We venture out for play, unbothered by rain. The grill on the back deck sends up smoke and scent, a signal of small happiness. And there is the ever-present sound of lawn mowers from spring till the grass ceases its growth in October. Trees abound, remnants of an older forest, granting shade in summer and a cascade of leaves in fall, demanding the annual ritual of rake and burn. The scent of burning leaves, it’s the harbinger of autumn’s arrival.\n\nWinter has been scarce of late, stretching the fall into a long, unbroken pause. Our garage faces the back, so the front door sees little use unless a visitor calls, a rarity. I occupy myself with tasks in the garage, the truck and other projects, and with doors open, I feel the pulse of the neighborhood. Holidays pass quietly, Thanksgiving bringing a scattering of distant kin and their vehicles, a similar scene on Mother’s Day and Christmas. This place, I find a fondness for it. Were it not for the cars that hurry through, it might be nigh unto perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert sits a neighborhood of dust and earth, where the land stretches barren and brown under a relentless sun. Those who have not walked its parched ground cannot fathom the oppression of such a monochrome world, save for the rare oasis of green where a man has surrendered riches to coax life from the soil. When I first came here in the nineties, the houses were scattered far and wide, a testament to solitude. Even now, with the new structures rising, the essence remains. The sprawl speaks of a city, yet it mirrors the change found in all places. People here bear warmth in their hearts, though shadows linger as in any town. My own corner of this desert is surrounded by kindly elders, marking it a refuge of sorts. The commerce of this place is dominated by familiar names, chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For the finer things, one must journey afar, for Whole Foods and their ilk are strangers here. Construction reigns in the trade of men, for this city is a canvas yet to be filled, its expanses inviting the hand of progress. This prospect unsettles me, for I cherish the present state, having fled the clamor of a metropolis and unwilling to return. I labor in this field, a craftsman of drywall and T-bar, marking my days with the rhythm of creation.\n\nYet the land holds its own allure, a sanctuary for creatures adapted to its harsh embrace. The desert's stark beauty draws souls seeking its truth, its challenging ecosystems demanding respect for coexistence. We, too, have found our place among the wild things, my children captivated by lizards and the myriad insects of the sands. Even as I write, their laughter echoes outside as they pursue their quarry. Our town offers its diversions, a taste of adventure in the embrace of Victorville. It is a haven for families, the desert unfolding its mysteries. Plan to visit when the San Bernardino County Fair enlivens the air, offering a Victorville welcome. Venture to nearby Wrightwood, where snow-capped peaks promise lessons in winter's arts. For those drawn to the origins of this land, the Victor Valley Museum stands with its relics of geology and ancient peoples, chronicling the tale of Victorville's rise from the dust.",
            "In the telling of my neighborhood, I reckon my answer might strike as peculiar. Where others might speak of picket fences and lawns, I speak of a place more transient and yet, for a time, eternal. The college campus where I bide my days, it is the land I call home, and the souls within the dormitory walls, they are my kin. Beyond them lies the campus, which sprawls like a yard untamed, a neighborhood in its own right, though lesser and more diffuse.\n\nYet here lies the truth of it: my neighborhood, though strange, is not so unlike those places people call home. It has its own houses, its own people, its own shops and parks. Let me take you through the houses that stand in this peculiar quarter. Three sorts there are—apartments, true houses, and those dormitory halls. In the apartments, they stack folk two or four to a chamber, with four to six chambers a floor. Two stories they rise, and twenty souls they hold, give or take.\n\nThen there are the houses, proper homes for those bound to the school, mostly alumni, who dwell within their two to four room confines. But scarce are these, scattered few across the land, for they are not efficient. Last, there are the dormitories—long corridors lined with rooms where hundreds of students abide. In each, two share a space, for the most part, and these dorms are the heart of my neighborhood.\n\nNow with the houses spoken for, let us turn to the people. The school takes pride in its diversity, and it is here, in the faces you meet in the halls and on the paths. From all lands and ages they come, making this place a tapestry of the world. The staff, they find shelter in the scattered houses, while new students fill the dorms and the older ones take to the apartments.\n\nAs for the stores and the parks, these too are part of my world. The campus is a town unto itself, with a bounty of shops and one lone park. There are places to eat, as there are in any town, and stores with the school’s own wares. In this neighborhood, whatever you seek is within reach. The park, a small respite, is a haven where all gather, kept clean and safe by the hands of those who dwell here.",
            "In the place where I reside, sidewalks are few and far between. The land falls away, giving itself to gravity, and my dwelling stands at the pinnacle of the steepest incline that the local folk know as the \"work out hill,\" for it beckons those who seek to test their mettle upon its slope. No sidewalks grace our street, so the people walk upon the asphalt, where the road is rough-hewn and treacherous to traverse. The wires of telephone and electric strung overhead hang in tatters, battered by the gales and storms that sweep through our land, leaving branches and debris to fell them time and again, their repair a patchwork quilt of human endeavor. Towering evergreens cast their long shadows all around, yet they are not cherished. No, the folk here wield their axes against them, for they covet the view of the sea, unbroken and vast. Thus, the houses rise high upon the hillside, glass-fronted and lofty, seeking the bay's embrace. At day's end, the sun kindles the water, and the heavens burn with orange, though oftentimes the clouds conspire to shroud that celestial fire. The days are gray and wet, and moss clings to all it can, to roofs and cars and railings alike. Once, I left my automobile idle in the drive for a month, and when I returned, it wore a green and furry coat of moss that took three hours to scrape clean. Here, children are scarce, though a school lies but a few blocks distant. My neighbors are mostly of the older sort, many having surrendered to retirement. In place of children, they keep dogs. You’ll see them lounging on lawns or racing down the street, and woe to those who leave a door or window ajar, for the dogs will venture in unbidden. I found one in my living room once and had to shoo it back out. Rabbits run rampant, too, some well-sized, much to the chagrin of the gardeners, who curse their burrows and their plundering of roots. My cats, they delight in the chase and have driven most rabbits from our midst. Birds are plentiful, flitting sparrows and hummingbirds, and now and then a hawk or eagle will appear, only to be chased away by the crows that rule the sky. Shops do not dwell here, but down the hill at the water’s edge, a few eateries serve the bounty of the sea. The beach is scant, but the rocks along the shore are fit for casting into the depths, and the bay is narrow; you can glimpse the far shore even through the mist that clings like a shroud most days.",
            "If you find yourself bound for Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, know that you will not struggle to find your way. The city’s arteries of steel and rail run deep and wide, carrying the masses to and fro with the ceaseless clamor of New York’s own breath. Bensonhurst stands proudly urban, its streets echoing the same rhythms that pulse through the heart of the city itself. And as you wander those streets, your eyes will fall upon the myriad Asian shops that have taken root. In the passing of two decades, the neighborhood has welcomed an influx of Asian souls, their presence marked by the scent of spice and the hum of commerce. Every block tells the tale, a testament to the supermarkets and laundromats that dot the landscape, serving the people with the nourishment they seek and the cleanliness they crave. The food is good, the prices fair, and the convenience unrivaled. Just beyond where I stand, four Asian markets lie clustered within two minutes' walk of each other, each a beacon of sustenance.\n\nYet do not let it be said that Bensonhurst is solely a haven for the Asian community. It is a mosaic, diverse and sprawling, with immigrants and their children, first and second generation, weaving the rich tapestry of life here. The businesses, large and small, speak of Asian ownership, yet they coexist alongside a recently renewed park, a refuge of play and sport. There, the earth is marked with ten basketball courts, a broad field for soccer or baseball, and courts for handball, swings, and a playground for the young ones. Even a fountain stands to bring joy in the heat of summer. The park is a testament to the city’s diversity, where all manner of folk gather and find common ground.\n\nThe skyline here is not pierced by the monoliths of corporate ambition, but rather by dwellings of cooperative living and condominium stature. Predominantly, it is a place of two-family homes, where life unfolds with a certain clatter. The people are kind, though their voices are loud. The air is filled with the roar of engines and the thrum of music as cars pass by, relentless and waking the dawn. Should your visit find you beneath the night’s cloak, be wary. The neighborhood, though safe, is unpredictable as the city’s own soul. Trouble may arise unbidden, in the form of bullies or thieves. I have felt it myself in years past, the sting of assault, and more recently, the theft of parcels. Such is the way of things. And though the city demands cleanliness, the rule is oft ignored. The morning light reveals the neglect, the dog waste that mars the path to the train or the market. It is a vexation, an affront to the senses, and one must tread carefully to keep their shoes unsullied.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, a town known to some as a bastion of oddity, there lies a truth about the very notion of \"weird.\" Scrawled upon the brick of a building that harbors a pizza joint, bar, music hall, and strip club, a phrase boldly declares, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To the few who remember, it calls back to the Portland of another time, a place less exposed to the world, where creativity roamed untethered in the shadows of the 90s and early 2000s. To others, it is a siren’s song, a lure to a city where the label of weird is worn like a medal of honor. Despite the tide of Californians with their gilded pockets and the rise of glass towers to shelter them, Portland remains untamed. Weirdness here does not always mean open arms, but rather an embrace of the unorthodox. It does not shun modernity, nor its struggles. Like the rest of the nation, we trade with the far East, our goods shipped from China’s distant shores. There are countless ways to be strange, to deviate from the norm, yet Portland holds its share of the mundane. It has yoga studios, hipsters, and men in suits. Perhaps being weird is simply to gaze upon all this with a wry smile. In my part of town, as in many corners of Portland, houses stand adorned in hues of the rainbow, gardens spill their bounty onto the sidewalk, and free boxes appear with the sun. These boxes, often simple cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold within them the magic of serendipity, offering treasures to the passerby. They brim with clothes, books, and sometimes the unexpected. This simple wonder of wandering the streets of Southeast Portland is the essence of the city, at least to me, though I am but one peculiar soul among many. Among us are those who would never dream of fetching garments from a box left on the curb. These folks linger at goat yoga—yes, the mats shared with bleating companions—or cheer at Timbers matches. Portland is a mosaic of passions, of dreams pursued or merely contemplated over drinks in dimly lit bars. It harbors a malaise of substances, a shadow cast by the mind’s turmoil, perhaps nurtured by the unending rain and the oppressive gray of the sky. Homelessness is another specter that haunts the city, a dilemma unsolved, despite the services that outshine much of the nation. The housed oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this, Portland is not so peculiar after all.",
            "The mountains stand eternal, ever present in the north, bearing silent witness to the sun's pilgrimage at dawn and dusk. No matter the forgetfulness of men or the ceaseless pace of their lives, they remain steadfast, untouched by the brief tribulations that consume us. And on those days when the weight of the world bears down and the soul strains under its yoke, the mountains call out with a quiet insistence. They compel the eyes to look upon them, and in that gaze, there comes a balm for the anxious spirit, a quiet fortitude to endure another day. I came to this land as a young scholar, my heart and mind drawn to the mountains that stood sentinel to the north of the campus. The university, with its grand buildings and serene ponds, has its own allure, but it is the mountains that hold dominion over my heart. The town itself carries a humble beauty. Countless cafés have played host to hours of study beneath the caffeinated haze. One can wander or take the bus to the heart of the town, where the faded bricks of restaurants and offices whisper tales of old. Here, this suburban place hums with the vigor of its urban neighbor, though the thrumming energy fades as you pass the library and find yourself once more in the quiet embrace of small-town life. This juxtaposition of worlds, so close yet distinct, lends the city a mysterious charm, beckoning the curious to explore its depths. Thus, it is easy to craft memories, each tied to a corner of the town. Be it the rusted swings in the park swaying in the night wind or the race through the bustling streets to catch a film at the grand theater. Yet, as with all places, it holds its share of harsh memories. The ponds, reflections of the soul, serve as sanctuaries for solitude or tears shed in the hours when time seems to stand still. Here, in the company of turtles and ducks and insects, all fulfilling their purpose, I ponder my own role in this vast enigma called life. I walk past the pond, past the park, past the houses that breathe suburbia, until the street unfurls before me. The sun casts its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky with its brilliance, and I realize my footsteps take me northward. And there, as always, are the mountains. Majestic and unwavering, they brush against the sky, a testament to endurance that speaks to the heart without uttering a word.",
            "It might escape your notice at first, the way things do when they are not meant to be seen or when they hide in plain sight. A residential sprawl tucked behind the commerce of consumption and need, a place you'd not likely reckon to find folks calling home. Yet if you venture past the derelict Whole Foods and sidle beyond the yearly occupied hotels, their empty rooms waiting for summer kin, you’ll come upon a living, breathing world. Streets unfurl with quiet purpose, and there lie clusters of apartment complexes, each one nestled against the other like Russian dolls dismantled and laid side by side in a deliberate line. The first of these has made the news, whispered tales of ill repute, but such talk is just smoke in the wind. There is more to see, more to know, in the apartments beyond, where life unfolds unbeknownst to the wider world.\n\nAcross from these homes of concrete and glass stands a community college's outpost, a sentinel of learning where students trickle in, clutching coffee and yawns, to greet the morning’s reluctant dawn. The gates groan open in greeting, and students slip through like ghosts, while drivers curse the delay, the inconvenience of it all. The road bends and breaks into another, flanked by a park and a place where broken bones find healing. The rehabilitation center stands with an air of cheer, its porch adorned with furniture and a fan that stirs the heavy summer air in lazy circles.\n\nChildren dance in the park, their limbs flailing in wild abandon, a blur of movement on the green, while bees hover above the flowers, drunk on the sun. Old souls shuffle with their dogs along the path, casting disapproving eyes at the skaters and nodding with soft approval at the young girls who gather to spin tales of boys and fleeting fame. Nearby, a sushi joint offers its wares, its tables never too crowded, while a place to buy swimming supplies and a nail salon sit in patient company. Here, the strip mall promises convenience, a trifecta of pleasure and necessity, where one might indulge in a manicure, a meal, and pool accouterments in one fell swoop. And there’s a frozen yogurt shop too, where teenagers come to cool their tongues and pretend at wisdom, cups of sweetness in hand as they weave across the pavement on their boards, smoke curling from their lips, believing it all to be the height of rebellion. This neighborhood is a tapestry of the American South, where the slow march of time barely registers, and life continues in its unchanging dance.",
            "The neighborhood stands in quiet witness to a bygone era. Houses, mostly singular in their countenance, stand like silent sentinels, though a few have been cleaved into twain yet remain conjoined, if such a thing makes sense. Before my abode, a modest patch of land lies, and to its flank, a narrow drive. These homes, like echoes of another time, speak of dreams once held dear beneath the vast, indifferent sky. The dream of suburbia, an American vision now slipping through grasping fingers, yet still these streets endure, whispering to all who pass that the dream yet breathes, and we cling to its fading promise.\n\nThe folk here, they do not brim with the optimism of yesteryear. The little plots of green are not tended as they once were, but still, there are cars resting in the drives, still the young ones heedless in their play, as if the world beyond were but a distant rumor. The old school, near ninety years standing, still looms, nurturing the young while stirring memory in the aged hearts. Churches stand scattered, more often empty than filled, yet the basketball courts echo with life. The homes, each with its own face, share a soul.\n\nA vast market, Super A, sits under the watchful eye of a Yemeni clan, perhaps the sole Arabs here, amidst a sea of African American neighbors. The streets stretch wide where children play football, only halting when the rumble of cars intrudes. Generations have passed through these streets, each with tales of a time when all knew all. A karate school once thrived here, until the allure waned with the silencing of Hollywood's tales of karate kids. Now it stands as a pharmacy, a place where remedies are promised, or so it is said.\n\nA humble cinema persists, offering old films at a price that draws the elders, nostalgic for simpler nights, while the young seek elsewhere. An expressway cuts near, though its entrance lies just beyond our reach. Once, a petition sought to bring it closer, the youth in favor, the elders wary. In the end, it was the elders' voices that stilled the city council’s hand, fearing it would mar the town's essence. A new high school rises, and with it, the question of a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country drawl and a log cabin might capture the spirit of this place.",
            "In the sprawl of this city where I make my home, the neighborhood unfolds like a quilt of manifold hues. The streets weave through a patchwork of residences and commerce, the latter bustling with offices and stores, eateries and places where folk find their mirth. The air is thick with the scent of new restaurants, each vying for the palate, and shops where one might find anything their heart desires. There are the great monoliths of commerce, the brands whose names carry weight, and yet these are flanked by the small boutiques, each with its own whispering allure. They stand in the malls and line the streets, close enough to the quiet enclaves of homes that one might hear the murmur of city life at their threshold.\n\nParks stand as islands amidst the urban sea, where the laughter of children mingles with the rustle of leaves. And the people here, they are as varied as the sky at dawn. Within a stone's throw, you find the vibrant communities of LGBTQ+ folks, the devout Orthodox Jews, and those who have journeyed from the lands of the once mighty Soviet Union. Beyond this small realm, the city stretches further into enclaves of every kind. There is a Korea town, a China town, a Little Armenia, all within a scant few miles, though those miles can stretch into hours when the roads are choked with the gridlock of human endeavor.\n\nFew walk in this city, for the distances are vast and the streets unfriendly to the pedestrian. The traffic is a beast with no master, and parking a prize hard won. Yet the city grows, ever taller and denser, as new apartments rise from the earth. This place draws folk like a beacon, and with them come more cars to clog the arteries of the city. Houses here are a tapestry of forms, from the single-family homes to the duplexes that share their walls. In my own corner of this metropolis, the homes stand varied and diverse, much like the people who dwell within them.\n\nThe faces here are many, the ages varied, though it is a lonesome truth that I know few of those who live beside me. The bonds of community have loosened, though I hold dear the memories of days spent in the company of neighbors, the laughter of children echoing in the warmth of the sunlit streets. The city, vast and sprawling, has changed, yet it holds within it the echoes of what once was.",
            "Where is everything, she asked, as we rolled past those endless cornfields that stretched out to meet the sky. This is it, I said, knowing the expanse would lay her soul bare. She came from a place where the grocer's was a mere five-minute walk, and she had never laid eyes on so much unbroken ground. Awash in the vastness, I told her of a life grown in rural Ohio, and in that telling, she saw the shadow of who I was and the soil from which I had sprung. We drove the narrow road, a ribbon of asphalt that wound to a quarry brimming with water, and there beyond lay the little settlement I called home. The houses were brick and stucco, each spread with half an acre of earth that folks tended as their own. Spring would find the land awash in flowers planted new each year, trees in their midwestern dress changing with the seasons. Driveways flaunted their luxury, Mercedes Benzes catching the midday sun like jewels. As we neared my gray stucco abode, my Korean neighbor stood in his yard, ever smiling. He passed his days with the mower, a song rising over its hum. The neighborhood found humor in him, but he was sincere and rich in his tales. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and his John Deere as if part of the ground itself. At last, you would come to my door. The side yard teemed with geese, ever pursued by the terrier. Behind, a slender stream fed into the quarry, where bullfrogs sang and the far-off low of cattle reached the ear. Across a bridge of hand-hewn wood lay a sanctuary untouched, where trees grew wild and herbs and flowers flourished. That was the world of my youth. Building forts in trees and the chase of imagined prey filled our days, always another child for company. Winters here could be cruel in their cold, yet possessed a beauty unmatched. The yard's green turned to a white wilderness. The trees, once flushed with color, stood as bare-boned sentinels. When snow came, the world transformed overnight. Snow angels made by my sister adorned the yard, snowmen too. We were fierce in our play, snowballs the weapons of our quarrels. We built igloos with branches, an armory of our own. In that frozen world, we lived in pretend, two children without a care. The world beyond was naught but a distant echo, and we were free."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, there lies a small town in Michigan, where fields stretch out to touch quaint tourist hamlets. There are no sprawling malls nor the bright lights of Wal-mart or Target, not even the hum of an Applebee's. To reach anywhere, one must drive, yet this place stands among the most beautiful in the world, cradled by water on all sides. My town is flanked by the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. Wherever your feet may wander, a beach waits to welcome them. \n\nThe neighborhood is a testament to small-town life. Houses breathe with space between them, not the uniform sameness of modern developments. Some are relics, lovingly restored, while others bear the marks of age. Most have full basements visible from the street. Time has clad many in aluminum siding, and each home stands painted in a spectrum that defies imagination. Yards stretch out with their own stories, trampolines and playsets dot the landscape. Gardens grow, and fences keep watch over their charges. These homes speak of Middle America, of those who toil and labor, raising families or having seen them grow and leave.\n\nOn any day, the streets are alive with children, their laughter echoing. Dogs trot beside their owners, bicycles whir past, and rollerblades skim the pavement. Neighbors nod in recognition, a quiet understanding of who belongs and who does not. The scent of grilling drifts by, a wave exchanged between strangers who are not quite strangers. Lawns lie neat, leaves banished with the passing of fall. Grass grows green and the plants are neatly trimmed. It is not a place of grandeur but one of substance, where you sense the goodness of raising a family. Quiet, peaceful, safe—a sanctuary in its own right.\n\nWithin walking distance, the county sheriff's department stands guard, the health department by its side. Down the road, the city recycling center serves its people. Nearby, the crack of bats and the call of names echo from the fields, where baseball and softball games unfold. A small airport hums at the edge, planes taking off and landing, their rhythms a part of the town's pulse. Ice cream can be found with a short walk, and downtown is but a stretch of the legs away. My children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks distant. It is, indeed, a fine place to call home.",
            "The land where I abide could be likened to the endless rows of houses that stretch in ordered lines like soldiers on parade, each indistinguishable from the next. In this enclave, the hand of the homeowner's association is evident, their presence as palpable as the asphalt underfoot. As you cross the threshold, your eyes are met with the sight of homes cared for with a meticulousness that speaks of the association's watchful eye. Each yard a mirror to its neighbor, patches of manicured grass bordered by pebbles, driveways short and squat, trees that stand not much taller than a man grown. Garages built for two stand sentinel beside each home. As you wind your way through these streets, the concrete before you is smooth, unmarred by the scars of time or neglect. Here, the roads are kept as if new, a testament to the many families who call this place home, yet not one pothole mars the surface. The houses, mostly one story, but for the occasional two, rise like the modest dreams of their builders. The post is not delivered to the door as one might expect, but rather to a communal gathering of metal boxes at the street's end, each with its own key, that grants access to letters and parcels alike. Again, the association's preference for orderliness is to thank.  \n\nSituated at the city's far-flung edge, where suburb meets the till of country soil, there is room enough for all manner of things. Pools, clear and well-kept, lie behind their fences, open to all who dwell within. Paths wind through the land, inviting the solitary walker or the company of a dog. Here, exercise does not demand a park; the neighborhood's breadth is its own track. Retirees form the backbone of this place, their presence lending a sense of security and watchfulness. Yet among them are those younger, professionals still in the midst of their working years. The city beyond, though populous, retains the heart of a small town. It offers what one might need, including a solitary mall, sufficient in its humble way. The journey to the city's heart takes but a quarter of an hour, where stores of all kinds await, from the organic to the frugal, each serving its purpose in the tapestry of commerce. This neighborhood, in its quiet and well-tended way, embodies the spirit of safety and care. While not nestled among the shops, a short drive opens the world of commerce to one's choosing.",
            "It was the first I'd heard of the place, the tale of it come to me while listening to a podcast about folks vanished into thin air. That took me aback some. Seemed every flat in them parts was priced through the roof, over a thousand a month. Strange thing was, neither I nor my friends had caught wind of such a story. Maybe it’s the struggle, I reckon. Some nights, I know, there are those among us who find sleep only through tears. Life ain't cheap, but we've learned the art of making do. You come to find a fondness for the musty scent of flea market trinkets and clothes long sealed in camphor. Life smells less when you're grown. Perhaps you take up smoking, or maybe you just grow too used to the way of things. Yet the flea market, it never fails to make its presence known. The scent of adulthood is like old magazines piled atop a shut piano. It settles into the leather and lingers even after a good scrub. Round here, you’ve got three thrift stores within a stroll. From one end, you can make the rounds to a couple of charity shops, a library, a rare book nook, and a curio emporium. Downtown is a crush, cars and folks filling the streets each dawn, yet inside the thrifts, it’s hushed. No matter the throng outside, the shop holds its silence. A fine spot to lose the hours of a day. And every year, there are more of those. Cars and people surging through. They call it a burgeoning city. Headquarters to one of the largest online empires for trade and delivery, it's still finding its legs. Brings to mind New York, where everyone chases their own stars, asking little of you. Here, solitude and silence are your own, and they grant you that. Not like the South, where a touch of concern means you care. No prying into lives here, truly. You can keep your guard up as long as you see fit, and the city will go on crashing and receding like waves on the shore. It's a place alive with life. Between the pianist next door and the two aspiring singers above, there’s always some manner of song. In some ways, it feels less like a flat of strangers and more a fellowship of kin. We gather for our needs, mark birthdays, grieve our losses, lend a hand when we can. I count myself fortunate to be among them. I find a liking in most of my neighbors, and they seem to treat me kindly in turn. I mind my mess and share my food, and they return the favor. I fetch their mail and they mine. It gladdens me to see them, and I dare say they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I dwell in this sprawling, unfeeling modernity, but it's folk like my neighbors what make me feel I ain't completely botched my life.",
            "In a place where the flat lands stretch out beneath the big sky, I make my home. It's a small town in the Midwest, clinging to the edges of a city that looms with its glass and steel. This town, or at least the part where I reside, has seen better days. On the eastern edge, where the sun rises over tired houses, the economy has cast its shadow long and cold. The houses there are humble, some worn with the years, others held together by the dreams of those who barely own them.\n\nYet it is not a place without its charms. The folks here, they nod and smile as you pass by, a silent fellowship bound by shared circumstance. The streets whisper of events that have come and gone, the kind that leave a mark. Crimes have brushed past our lives like a chill wind, but they have not yet laid their claim on us. A young man was lost to a bullet not far from where I write, his parents now neighbors of ghostly sorrow.\n\nThe town, like many, bears the scars of a war fought not with guns but with needles and pills. The opioid plague has taken its due, lives snuffed out by the silent specter of fentanyl. But there are those who fight back, offering salvation in clinics and training sessions, a battle for souls in the guise of education and care.\n\nAnd still, life persists in small triumphs. My son, who walks a different path, finds solace in a school that embraces him. The people there, from the principal to the teachers, they nurture a community where no child is made to feel alone. The town's heart beats strongest in these small acts of kindness and provision, where no child is left hungry or shamed for lack of means.\n\nThe town council has set its sights on renewal, paving roads and planting new life in parks, though their gaze seldom falls on the east, where the old roads bear witness to neglect. It stirs a quiet discontent among us, those who call this side home.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, this town is where I choose to be. It holds a strange beauty, the people warm, the schools safe. The shops provide what's needed, and our home, though modest, holds a comfort that can't be measured in dollars. Sixteen years have passed since we first put down roots here, and the thought of leaving is as foreign as a distant land.",
            "In the old neighborhood there's a place where time seems to linger like the fog atop the hill. Buildings with histories etched in their bones stand watch, silent sentinels of a bygone era. My home is a seven-story edifice across the street from an ancient theater, its marquee long darkened. Down the hill a piece there's a place where people gather, an arcade bar, alive with the hum of summer's warmth, and the people, they come in droves when the nights stretch long and the air is like a balm. In June and July the line stretches down the block, a testament to the pull of light and laughter.\n\nUp the way a few blocks lies the park, a vast expanse given the confines of the city. Encased in concrete with great stone steps hewn with purpose. In winter's grip, the homeless stake their claims, erecting shelters in rows along the sidewalks and those steps. The snow, it seldom falls, but the rain comes with a vengeance, and it seeps into the very marrow of the bone. Their tents, clustered close, offer warmth to those who choose the city over the wild. For them, the family center, a place where the dignity of a shower is within reach, stands just a few blocks further.\n\nThe city's beauty is not lost on me, the architecture a testament to human endeavor, but it is the pulse of the people that draws me in. Hilltop, a name that once whispered fear in the hearts of those who heard it, tales of violence and the sweep of federal brooms trying to cleanse it. Yet the stories linger, passed down like heirlooms, and the memory of those days still hangs in the air. The people here, they labor under the weight of history, striving to keep the streets clean, to hold onto a sense of pride. Whispers persist, warnings not to walk these streets after dark, but I find them echoes of a time past, shadows cast by the light of fear and ignorance.\n\nPerhaps the Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the scars that mark this nation. For all its claims of being a melting pot, the city bears the stains of division, ignorance festering beneath the surface. Yet here, in this place I call home, there's a certain aliveness in the night air, a sense of belonging. I've walked these streets and found kindness in unexpected places, a jacket offered against the chill, a laundromat open late for a moment of respite. I've sat in the rain, believing myself unseen, only to be met with a gaze that said otherwise, a hand that offered a gift and a word of affirmation. In Hilltop, I find the threads of humanity woven tight, a tapestry of lives intermingled, and in that, there is a beauty all its own.",
            "I come to this place when the world was still young to me, just before the eighth grade, and the echoes of its streets were unfamiliar. At first, the solitude was a companion, a whisper in the shadowed alleys of my mind, but in time I found solace in the company of a boy two doors down and another who walked the same stretch of road. They are gone now, but their ghosts linger in the quietude of memory. The neighborhood, a tapestry of American suburbia, remains with its two-story houses standing like sentinels under the indifferent sky. Weekends, when warmth spills over the earth, children’s laughter threads the air like a hymn, but most days silence reigns. The people here, they leave you be unless you call upon them. Trust is woven into the very fabric of the place, unspoken yet steadfast. Not once has my porch been robbed of its parcels, and this speaks to something deeper than mere words. A stone's throw away lies a park, a repository of my youthful endeavors. Basketball, football, baseball—the games we played beneath the sun's watchful gaze. It holds the shadow of pain too, the sharp memory of a broken nose, yet the light outweighs the dark. Now, I walk there with my cousin's children, their laughter a bridge to the past as they swing and slide with abandon. Nostalgia, a gentle specter, walks beside me. Diversity colors this neighborhood in myriad shades. Within a mile's reach, flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy beckon. Fast food reigns supreme, as is the way of suburbia, and pizza places dot the landscape. The stores, they are filled with everything a soul might seek. Dry cleaners aplenty, a Walgreens, a CVS, and the Jewel-Osco that anchors the street, its name a familiar song in the Midwest. Even here, diversity whispers its presence with an Indian-owned store for those who crave the taste of home. In all, this place is a balm to the tales of discord and discontent that echo from the screens of social media. For this, I am grateful.",
            "The neighborhood rose up around the college like some old sentinel, watchful and weary. Apartments stood like sentinels themselves, blocks of stone and brick, whispering the secrets of the many who have passed through their halls. A smattering of restaurants and bars, their lights flickering like phantoms in the night, offered solace to weary souls. One bar got itself a new name, a fresh coat of paint, and with it, a price that spoke of aspirations above its station, though the spirits within were no less potent for the change. The folks here, they are mostly youth with the fire of future dreams burning bright, or those who scrape by, the cost of living a cruel arbiter. The streets ring with the laughter of children, a school just a stone’s throw away, its walls echoing with the promise and potential of youth.\n\nI share walls with neighbors I do not know, nor care to. Their smoke seeps through the walls, mingling with the air of my abode, so much so that management saw fit to place a mask of fragrance by their door. My partner and I, we chuckled at the absurdity of it. Insulting? Perhaps, and yet here we are. The buildings around me bear the mark of age, their facades worn and weary, yet inside, some hold a surprise of modernity. Down the road, in contrast, are the new pretenders, apartments gleaming with promise but built on foundations of deceit. Their allure is but a façade, yet they stand near the heart of learning, their cost justified by proximity rather than quality.\n\nThere’s a diner nearby, a place where sustenance is served on paper, with the hum of microwaves a constant chorus. Across from it stands a gas station, a place of toil that bears its own stories of hardship. Yet, the city paid its due, and the roads were made anew, ribbons of concrete bordered by green, a touch of civility amidst the urban sprawl. My dwelling is enfolded in trees, though some have fallen to the axe, leaving their stumps as silent witnesses. Beyond the tree line, more apartments rise, and further still lies 43rd street, a place where neglect has taken root. The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings worn, and the trees stand as veils to what lies beneath. Crime finds its den there, though it is not alone in its claim.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, I find contentment in my abode. It stands within reach of the university, a beacon of knowledge a mere walk away. Two bus stops lie at my feet, paths to the wider world, to stores and the heart of the city. In this place, I find a balance of necessity and convenience, a life tethered to a place I can call home.",
            "In a small enclave of duplexes, the cul-de-sac lay like a forgotten relic of another time. The houses, though intended to stand alone, bore the uniformity of their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, each a mirror of the next and yet distinct in the way they absorbed the sun and shadow. There was a camaraderie among the inhabitants, a quiet understanding forged in the simple act of gathering at the end of an undecided driveway. Evenings found us there, where children played with toys and chalk and kites under a sky vast and indifferent, and the world seemed less burdened by the machinations of modern life.\n\nThe landscape stretched out in fields and trees, an expanse softened by the blue of the heavens and the drifting clouds. But this season brought with it a portentous air, the promise of storms brewing in the distance. The sirens wailed their mournful warning, a sound not yet familiar but soon to be, and so we sought shelter. In the bathtub, clutching the smallest dog like a talisman, I hunkered down with my purse and a few pillows. The big dog, obstinate in his fear, barked at the storm from the living room, his voice rising against the hail that fell like judgment upon the earth. \n\nWhen the storm passed, the road steamed in the wake of the tempest, the hail dissolving upon the hot pavement as if it had never been. The sun broke through clearing skies, and rain fell softly, conjuring a double rainbow that arced over the quiet street. I captured the moment with a camera, a testament to share with friends and kin, a marvel that left us all in awe. An hour passed in silence before life resumed its rhythm, as mothers and children reappeared, drawn outside by the promise of dinner and the fading light. For a newcomer from the North, this place was a balm, its southern drawl a music that I was beginning to love.\n\nThe apartment I called home was like the others, two bedrooms and two baths, yet inside, they varied in space and comfort, a mystery among many. Behind the dwellings lay a great field, inviting me to wander to the edge of the pond, a place not meant for swimming. In the early hours, the deer moved in silence, and the bullfrog's song resonated across the stillness of morning. It was a sanctuary, just forty minutes from the city of Charlotte, where the rooster's crow heralded the dawn and a donkey's bray signaled the coming night. This was my fortune, to have stumbled upon such a place, a small community unto itself, a gem in the rough-hewn fabric of the South.",
            "In the ten long years since I came to this place, I reckon I’ve learned a thing or two worth telling. The day I left Riverdale for Stockbridge was a sorrowful one. I cried for the parting of familiar faces and places, and though it stung, my folks believed it was for the best. They wanted something better for me and my sister, a place where a home was more than a roof and a high school was more than a building. So we moved from what some called ghetto to something else entirely. \n\nOver time, I grew accustomed to this new land of ours, found friends and foes in the halls of the school. Yet, I never came to know the neighbors too well, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, and Dennis too for a spell. They lived right next door, and in their company, I found a semblance of family. I hold dear the memory of attending Mr. Glen’s wedding, or rather his re-marriage, with my folks and sister. It was a day of joy, a glimpse into a future I hope to craft for myself, where the woman beside me lives like a queen. I remember catching the garter but not the flowers, a small whimsy of fate. We danced until the night grew old, and in that dance, I shared a moment with Marsharii, one of Glen’s daughters. She’s gone her way since, and I hope it’s led her to greater things.\n\nThe neighborhood itself sprawls like a maze, though a GPS now guides my ventures through its winding paths. I have wandered far as I dared, often with Kason and Curtis by my side. We spent hours lost in games and laughter, seeking joy wherever it hid. Sometimes, I find peace in the park, where nature’s quiet balm soothes the soul. There, I balance on sticks from the Home Depot and wield my bokken sword, playing at ancient arts. There’s a court for basketball and tennis too, though it’s been years since I’ve played. My father instilled a love for tennis in me and my best friend, under the watchful eye of Mr. Graves. Those were days of labor and laughter, and the memory of them lingers still.\n\nThere are many memories here, tales of a life lived and moments cherished, but these are the ones that linger in my mind. And I reckon the finest days are still ahead.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town named Johnston, a place unremarkable in the eyes of the world yet bearing the quiet pride of a locale that calls itself the Peach Capital. This is not written on the stones of history but on a weathered sign that greets you at the threshold. The land stretches out, vast and silent, orchards of peach trees standing in solemn rows, cattle wandering the pastures. Houses rise sporadically from the earth, two-story sentinels clad in metal roofs to fend off the relentless summer sun or the more subdued gray shingles. They sit back from the ribbon of road, yielding their fields to the toil of men and the seasons' yield.\n\nAt the heart of the town, there hangs a stoplight, a solitary guardian over the crossroads where the few stores gather. Here, you find sustenance in places like Hong Kong, a humble Chinese eatery kept by one family, or Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger haven. The pizzeria, once a member of this ensemble, has since shuttered its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny pharmacy known not for its prescriptions but for the Cherry Coca-Cola it dispenses, stands as a relic of small-town commerce. The IGA, a grocery store, holds its ground, though folks often venture to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their larger needs. Dollar General, the town's bustling hub, draws the people with its promise of everyday essentials, its doors swinging open to the constant flow of residents.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a small venture under the stewardship of a kindly woman, offers not just furnishings but the service of two movers, delivering comforts to scattered homes. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures, a small domain of grooming and care. A doctor and a veterinarian work in small practices, their hands skilled in tending to the ailments of both man and beast, set apart from the town's core.\n\nJohnston Elementary School stands as the lone institution of early learning, sending its children forth to neighboring towns for continued education. Parks are but a dream in progress, a 2.5-acre promise of recreation and respite, a hope to draw more souls to this quiet enclave. The town lacks the diversions of a larger world—no theaters, no alleys for bowling, no sanctuaries of leisure or playgrounds for the young. Yet in its simplicity, there lies a charm, a fleeting existence that might escape the notice of those who pass by, but lingers in the hearts of those who call it home.",
            "In the small southern town of Tennessee, where the suburbs stretch out like an old quilt, a road runs between two highways bringing a touch more traffic than one might desire. Yet it's a place of quietude, a neighborhood where folks are known and seldom change. The faces are familiar, their habits too, like the sound of rakes in fall or the hum of lawnmowers cutting grass till October's end. \n\nOur house sits at the corner, watching the world pass by. We know the cars and the people, and we mark the strangers like a whisper of wind through the trees. Dogs are walked, children weave their bicycles through the streets, and we too are part of this rhythm, my wife and I, and our two daughters, growing tall in the shadow of the trees. We work from home, and our comings and goings are as known to others as theirs are to us. \n\nThe grill on the back deck smokes with the promise of barbecue, mingling with the scent of burning leaves that heralds the coming of fall. The winters have grown light, more like an extended autumn, and in these days the garage at the back of the house becomes my retreat. There I tinker with my truck, the open doors a window into the life that moves around me. \n\nHolidays pass in quietude, save for the gatherings that bring a scatter of unfamiliar cars. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas, they come and go like leaves on the wind. And though the street carries more than its share of travelers, this place is home, a haven of sorts, and if only it were not a through street, it might be near perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert there lies a neighborhood, a place where the land stretches out in a vast expanse of dust and sand and the relentless sun beats down upon the earth. To live here is to know the color of the world is a ceaseless brown, save for the rare green of a lawn that speaks of extravagance and toil. In the days when I first settled here in the nineties, the houses were scattered far and wide across the parched land. Though time has brought new faces and structures, the essence remains unchanged, a city rising slowly from the dust.\n\nThe people of this place are mostly kind, a testament to the spirit of the desert, but like any city, it holds its shadows. My neighbors are the old guard, friendly souls who have seen the desert change and remain steadfast in their ways. The stores here are the familiar chains, offering the staples of life, yet if one seeks the finer things, the journey must extend beyond this enclave.\n\nConstruction is the lifeblood of this place, a testament to the untamed spaces that still await man's ambition. I find a certain unease in this, for I cherish the quiet expanse that surrounds us. My own craft lies in this realm, a maker of walls and ceilings, yet I hold a fondness for the creatures that call this land home. The desert is a place of stark beauty, a fragile ecosystem that harbors life both strange and marvelous. My children, wild as the lizards they chase, delight in the desert's offerings, their laughter mingling with the wind.\n\nAmidst this rugged landscape, there are places to see and things to do. Victorville offers its own brand of allure, a chance to witness the desert's majesty, especially when the San Bernardino County Fair arrives, bringing with it a sense of festivity and wonder. Not far lies Wrightwood, where the mountains stand tall and cloaked in snow, a place for those who seek the thrill of winter’s sport.\n\nFor those drawn to the stories of the land, the Victor Valley Museum holds the keys to the past, with its geological treasures and relics of those who walked this ground before us. Here, the tales of the desert unfold, chronicling the journey of those who dared to make a life in this unforgiving place.",
            "When they ask about my neighborhood, the description that comes forth may seem set apart from the rest. For there are those who speak from the vantage of homeowners, anchored in lives of their own making. Yet mine is a path that diverges a shade. My neighborhood is the college campus upon which I reside, and the souls housed in the dormitory are the kinship I know. The campus that envelopes it all is part of my claim, though it holds a subtler tether.\n\nDespite this oddity, my neighborhood bears the echoes of what is deemed conventional. Like any neighborhood drawn in the mind's eye, mine too holds houses, people, stores, and parks. Let us first turn our gaze to the \"houses\" that make up this place I call home. Before the exploration begins, clarity calls for the kinds of dwellings found here. There are three: the apartments, the real houses, and the dormitory houses. \n\nIn the apartments, where space is shared, you find two to four souls to a room, and four to six rooms claim a floor. These buildings stretch to two floors, harboring twenty lives within their walls. Then come the actual houses, open to those tied to the school. These are two to four-bedroom affairs, often lodgings for alumni. They are scattered few, a testament to their lesser efficiency. Finally, the dormitories rise, where hundreds stake their claim. Here, two share a room, and it is the common abode in my vicinity.\n\nWith the matter of housing laid bare, we turn to the people. My school stands proud in its diversity, and this tapestry is mirrored in my neighborhood's essence. From varied cultures and ages, they gather. Professional staff find homes in the houses, new students in dormitories, and the elder students in apartments. Words fall short of capturing their essence, so we move on to the stores and parks that embellish the land.\n\nThe school, its own self-contained realm, offers a trove of stores and a singular park. The stores blend dining as found in any land, alongside the school's own unique offerings of attire and provisions. Thus, all that one seeks lies within the bounds of this neighborhood. The park stands as a playground for the diverse souls that dwell here, kept pure and safe by the watchful care of its community.",
            "In the place where I live, sidewalks are scarce and the land slopes away like the skin of some great beast. My house perches atop the neighborhood's steepest rise, a humpbacked hill that folks have christened the \"work out hill\" for the way it draws joggers to its incline. Sidewalks are absent, and so the people tread the asphalt path, a road pocked and worn, treacherous in its own right. The wires of telephone and electricity sag overhead, frayed by the elements, a testimony to the bouts of rain and storm that lash the place. Branches fall with regularity, striking down the lines till they bear the look of patchwork. \n\nEvergreens stand tall and indifferent, their green a defiance of the sky’s gray. Yet the people here harbor no love for them, for they are but obstructions to the ocean's expanse. Houses rise on the hill, each tiered higher than the last, their glass facades hungering for the bay’s view. Come sunset, the waters burn with light drawn from some inner fire, the sky awash in orange. More oft than not, though, the clouds drape low, a haze through which sunlight strains to reach. The days are damp, casting a pall of moss upon all it can claim: roofs, cars, railings. Once my own car, left to languish in the drive, grew a coat of green that cost me three hours to scrape away.\n\nChildren are a rarity in these parts, though a school stands but blocks away. The inhabitants are mostly older folk, veterans of life's work, settled into retirement. Their companions are creatures of four legs, dogs that populate lawns and race down streets in spirited chase. Leave open a door or window at your own peril, for they may wander unbidden indoors. I once found one in my parlor, needing to shoo it back out into the world. Rabbits too roam freely, their numbers swelling till the gardeners curse them for the holes they dig and the havoc they wreak. My cats find them sport, thinning their ranks with tireless zeal. Above, the sky belongs to the birds, sparrows and hummingbirds flitting about, while the occasional hawk or eagle dares the crows’ ire.\n\nStores are a distant promise, but down the slope at the waterfront lie eateries where the sea’s bounty is served fresh. The beach is but a thin line, its stones inviting the hand to hurl them into the bay. The bay itself is a narrow thing, the far shore visible even through the mist’s shroud on most days.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies Bensonhurst, a place easy enough to find if you're set on it. The veins of the city run deep and wide through its streets, public transport threading these pathways with the constancy of a river. The urban sprawl of New York City does not relent here, and in its embrace, you will find Bensonhurst much the same, a hub where cultures intertwine and histories linger in every corner shop and park bench.\n\nThe scent of the Orient wafts through the air, for in recent times, the Asians have come in numbers, staking their claim upon the landscape with markets and laundromats, their signs a testament to a changing world. Each block tells a story of enterprise and migration, where the wares of the East meet the appetites of the West. Imposing supermarkets stand sentinel, their offerings rich and varied, and the price fair enough to draw even the most discerning of patrons. The convenience of it all is undeniable. Four markets, no more than a stone's throw from one another, speak to the abundance that lies at one's feet.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not a monolith, not solely the domain of one people. It is a tapestry woven with threads of many hues, immigrants mingling with the offspring of their dreams, the children of America’s promise. Still, the Asian presence is pronounced, their endeavors dotting the landscape like stars in a night sky.\n\nThe park, freshly renewed, offers respite and play, a place where the young and the restless find their sport. Courts ring with the echoes of games, fields stretch green and wide. In summer's heat, the fountain's spray beckons, a siren's call to laughter and delight. Here, diversity finds its voice, children of every origin finding common ground in the simple joy of play.\n\nBuildings rise in modest stature, co-ops and condominiums, homes for the many who seek shelter here. Mostly, it is the two-family houses that stand, their occupants as varied as the city itself. The people, kind enough in their way, fill the air with the noise of their lives, the music of engines and the symphony of city living. \n\nWhen the sun sets, the city reveals another face. Safety is a relative term, a fragile thing. Shadows move in the night, and caution is a companion one should not abandon. The specter of trouble lingers; I have known it myself, in days past when violence found me unawares. Thieves too, ever opportunistic, ply their trade, absconding with that which is not theirs.\n\nThe streets bear witness to another neglect, the disregard for the law concerning the waste of dogs. A daily presence, it mars the path to the station, an unwelcome reminder of the shortcomings of civic duty. In Bensonhurst, as elsewhere, vigilance is key, lest your soles bear the brunt of another’s disregard.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, there lies a whisper of strangeness, a notion tethered to the bones of the city, not unlike a ghost that refuses to abandon its haunt. The phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\" is scrawled upon the rear of a building that plays many roles—a pizzeria, a tavern, a stage for music, a dim-lit den where the law is more suggestion than rule. It is both a lament for a bygone Portland of the nineties and early aughts, when the city was a secret known only to those within its embrace, and an invitation to those who seek solace in the peculiar. To be called weird here is to be given a badge of honor, a mark of belonging to a tribe that holds the unusual in high regard.\n\nThe city, despite the tide of wealthy newcomers from the southlands and the rising towers of habitation built to house them, retains its oddities. To be weird is not always to be welcoming, yet it allows for the acceptance of that which the world might cast aside. Like any other city, it bears the marks of modernity, the goods from distant shores, the struggles that mirror those of its nation. Portland is a tapestry of the extraordinary and the mundane, woven with threads of yoga mats and vinyl records, suits and startups. To be weird might simply mean to carry all this with a measure of levity.\n\nIn the quarters where I dwell, bright abodes stand in rows, gardens bursting with herbs and blossoms, and the sidewalks are lined with the offerings of free boxes. These are not mere containers but vessels of possibility, often filled with garments and tomes, waiting for the passerby to claim their unexpected fortune. This discovery, this serendipity, is the essence of Portland, though my version of it is but one among a multitude. There are those who eschew the sidewalk's bounty, opting instead for goat yoga—where creatures with hooves share the mat—or the roar of Timbers games.\n\nThe city is a mosaic of passions and pursuits, dreams chased and dreams deferred, often over a pint too many. Shadows linger over Portland, cast by the weight of addiction and the specter of homelessness, ailments of the mind and spirit exacerbated by the relentless rain and brooding skies. The city offers a refuge of sorts, its services a beacon to those adrift, yet they fall short, as do the hearts of its citizens, who oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this, Portland is not peculiar at all, but a reflection of a broader human condition.",
            "The mountains stood eternal, immutable, watchmen of the north. Each dawn they rose to greet the sun and each dusk they bade it farewell. No matter the forgetfulness of man or the distractions of his labor, they endure, unyielding and indifferent to the petty strife of mortal life. In the moments when the world pressed too hard upon me, clawing at my nerves, they called me to witness them. In their silent majesty, I found a balm for my restless spirit, a quiet strength to carry me forward, one footfall after the next. I came here first as a young scholar, drawn to the northern slopes that loomed over the campus like ancient sentinels. True, the university was a place of beauty in its own right, with its grand edifices and tranquil ponds, its noble trees. Yet, it was the mountains that claimed my heart, their throne unchallenged. The town itself, with its charming cafés that were sanctuaries of caffeine and late-night study, was not without its allure. A short walk or bus ride to the heart of downtown, and one found themselves amidst the faded bricks, steeped in the aura of ages. Here the town shed its suburban skin, revealing a pulse of life akin to the city's urban heart. But the bustle was brief, a few blocks of clamor before the quietude returned, slipping past the library into the hushed streets once more. This juxtaposition, this mingling of worlds, lent the city an air of mystery, a silent invitation to wander and discover. In such a place, memories are woven into the fabric of existence. There were nights spent under the stars, laughing with friends by rusted swings, and mad dashes through crowded streets to catch a film, the tickets a gift from the university. Yet, as with all places touched by time, there were shadows too, memories that cut deeper. The ponds, often a mirror for reflection, were also the setting for my darkest hours, a sanctuary for tears shed under the moon's pale light. It was there, in the solitude of night, amid the turtles and the ducks, that I pondered my place in the grand design, grappling with the enigma of being. So I wandered, past the pond, through the park and the quiet houses, until the main street beckoned. As the sun cast its golden glow upon the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of dawn, I realized my path led northward. There they were, steadfast and unchanging. The mountains, vast and timeless, brushed the heavens with their peaks, more enduring than any man-made tower. In their silent presence, I found my resolve, a quiet voice urging me onward, ever onward.",
            "You might pass it by in a moment’s glance, a place unseen and unheeded. A residential quarter tucked behind the commerce of the world, not a place meant for living, or so it seems. But wander past the vacant husk of an old Whole Foods, skirting the hotels that stand like sentinels abandoned save for the bustling of summer kinships, and you will uncover a hidden thrum of life. Streets lined with apartments, stacked close like Russian dolls laid bare and set in their order, a slow unfolding down the lane. The first you find have whispered tales of ill repute, the kind that live in the shadows, but we’ll leave those for another time, for truth can hide beneath the veils of rumor. The ones beside them, and those beyond, hold tales untold, a world apart from the knowing eyes of most. Across from them, a satellite of learning stands, quiet and solemn, where the young trudge in with the morning’s first light, coffee in hand, battling the waking hours. The iron gates groan their welcome as they filter through, the road outside a cacophony of grumbling commuters, the dance of traffic held fast on busier days. The street comes to halt at another, where a park stretches out, and a center for healing those whose bones have met misfortune. There, porch chairs sit in the sun, a ceiling fan lazily stirring the heavy summer air. Children flit across the park’s expanse, a blur of life against the green, bees floating languid in the patchwork of flowers by the road. Old souls shuffle along with their dogs, frowning at the youths on their boards, nodding at the clusters of girls whispering their secrets of boys and online fame. Beside the park, in a strip mall, a sushi place offers its wares, a quiet affair, with a swimming supply store and a nail salon nestled close. Here, one could ready their pool, adorn their nails, and feast on hibachi in a single afternoon—a testament to the strip mall’s peculiar charm. There is a place for frozen yogurt too, where the young gather, clutching their chilled confections as they skate and vape in a bid for coolness. This neighborhood is a quiet echo of Americana, a slow-moving river of time where change comes with great reluctance, if at all.",
            "In the quiet sprawl of my neighborhood, there lies an old story stitched into the very earth. The houses stand solitary, mostly, though here and there you find one cleaved in two yet joined like a pair of weary twins. My own home, it sits with a modest yard before it and a narrow driveway to the side, a relic of a time when the dream was more than just a memory flickering on the edge of darkness. Once this dream cradled the soul of a nation, yet now it seems to drift away like smoke on the wind. But here, in this place, it lingers still, a whisper to those who will listen, a promise that has not yet faded entirely. The people, though, wear the years heavily, their hope not as bright as it once was. The little yards no longer tended with the care they once knew. Yet cars idle in the driveways, and the children play as if this world were all they would ever need, their laughter the pulse of the street. The school, standing for nearly ninety years, remains a bastion of futures yet to be and memories long past. Churches are sparse, their pews empty, but the courts echo with the beat of basketballs. These homes, different to the eye, share a sameness in their bones. There is a supermarket, grandly named Super A, owned by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs here, while most who walk these streets are African American. The roads are broad, and the children play football, pausing only to let the cars pass in their slow procession. Many here can speak of days gone by when all knew each other by name. Once there was a karate school, but the dreams of being a karate kid faded with the films, and now it is a pharmacy, for in these times, medicine is the balm for all ills, or so it is said. A small theater remains, showing old reels to the delight of elders, an escape from the young who crave the new. An expressway cuts through the land, but its exits lie elsewhere, a decision fought over, the young in favor, the old against, fearing the change it might bring. Now a new high school rises, and we ponder a mascot fitting for our town. Perhaps a cyborg with a southern drawl and a log cabin at its heart would do us justice, a blend of the old and the new, as we are.",
            "In the sprawl of the great city, where the streets snake and twist like old riverbeds carved through stone, the neighborhood stands in its manifold diversity. Between the looming edifices of commerce, there lay scattered domiciles, each nestled in its own peculiar corner. The businesses rise like sentinels, offices and stores and eateries, a panoply of trade and sustenance. There is no famine of new taverns to patronize, nor shops to wander through. Some of these are grand emporiums, the offspring of distant corporate giants, yet among them, small boutiques flourish, their presence a testament to the city's eclectic soul. They line the streets like sentries, their windows reflecting the quietude of nearby residences, which might remain tranquil were it not for the clamor of the city's heartbeat. Parks, green and solemn, offer respite amidst the chaos, where families gather, children laughing in the sun's embrace.\n\nThe people, too, are a tapestry of life woven from threads of countless origins. There in a single breath of space, the LGBTQ+ community finds its voice, the Orthodox Jews uphold their ancient rites, and refugees from lands once bound by the Soviet yoke seek new beginnings. Beyond this enclave, the city unfurls further, revealing enclaves named for distant lands—Korea, China, Armenia—each a world unto itself, yet mere miles apart. But in this city, a mile can stretch long as a lifetime, the roads choked with the ceaseless tide of vehicles, a pilgrimage of metal and exhaust. Few choose to walk, for the city is vast and implacable, and the foot is slow. Thus the roads become rivers of steel, parking a mirage ever just out of reach.\n\nDespite it all, the city's allure draws newcomers, and with them the rising towers of construction, a skyline ever-changing. The prospect of yet more souls and their chariots stirs discontent among the settled. But the diversity of dwellings remains—houses of every shape and size, apartments and condominiums, single-family abodes, and duplexes—all testament to the city's varied heart. In the midst of it, the community, a mosaic of ages and faces, is not as it once was. The bonds that held neighbor to neighbor have loosened, memories of childhood games in the sun now shadows of the past, when the streets were alive with the voices of youth.",
            "She looked out at the endless stretch of cornfields, a horizon unbroken save for the occasional silo, and asked, Where is everything? And I told her, This is it. Her eyes wide with the wonder of it. She came from a town where the grocery store was but a stone's throw from her door, and never had she beheld such expanse. I spoke to her of growing up in the wide plains of rural Ohio, and in that sharing, she understood a piece of me, the place that shaped me.  \n\nWe traveled the narrow ribbon of road that wound its way through the land, past a quarry filled with still water, and came upon my small settlement. The houses stood, mostly brick and stucco, each cradled by the earth with a half-acre of land for its own. Folks took pride in the care of that land, tending to it as if it were kin. Spring would come, and with it, the flowers, planted anew each year, and the trees that spoke of the seasons' change.  \n\nIn the driveways rested the polished chariots, gleaming under the midday sun, Mercedes Benz, the pride of their owners. As we continued, my grey stucco home came into view, and there was my neighbor, the Korean man with the kind eyes, always outside with a nod and a smile. He'd spend his days with mower and song, and his joy became the music of the place. Age had softened him some, but in his past, he was a healer, a doctor, though now he seemed a part of the earth itself.  \n\nWe reached my home, where the geese wandered the side yard, taunted by our Terrier. Behind, a small stream whispered its way to the quarry, the bullfrogs sang their chorus, and the distant cows lent their voices to the day. Across a simple wooden bridge lay an untouched world, a sanctuary of wild growth, herbs and flowers untamed.  \n\nHere was the heart of my childhood, where forts were built in trees and the chase of critters was my hunt. Always there was something to be done, a companion to be found in one of the neighborhood children. Winters came with their own harsh beauty, the green fields turned to a stark, barren land. Snow, when it blessed us, transformed all into a wonderland. My sister and I would fashion angels in the drifts and build men of snow. We fought, as siblings do, our snowballs the ammunition of youth.  \n\nIn our snowbound fortress, we played our games, a world of pretend where nothing else existed, just two children amid the silence of the winter, the world beyond forgotten."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, there lies a small town in Michigan, where fields stretch out to touch quaint tourist hamlets. There are no sprawling malls nor the bright lights of Wal-mart or Target, not even the hum of an Applebee's. To reach anywhere, one must drive, yet this place stands among the most beautiful in the world, cradled by water on all sides. My town is flanked by the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. Wherever your feet may wander, a beach waits to welcome them. \n\nThe neighborhood is a testament to small-town life. Houses breathe with space between them, not the uniform sameness of modern developments. Some are relics, lovingly restored, while others bear the marks of age. Most have full basements visible from the street. Time has clad many in aluminum siding, and each home stands painted in a spectrum that defies imagination. Yards stretch out with their own stories, trampolines and playsets dot the landscape. Gardens grow, and fences keep watch over their charges. These homes speak of Middle America, of those who toil and labor, raising families or having seen them grow and leave.\n\nOn any day, the streets are alive with children, their laughter echoing. Dogs trot beside their owners, bicycles whir past, and rollerblades skim the pavement. Neighbors nod in recognition, a quiet understanding of who belongs and who does not. The scent of grilling drifts by, a wave exchanged between strangers who are not quite strangers. Lawns lie neat, leaves banished with the passing of fall. Grass grows green and the plants are neatly trimmed. It is not a place of grandeur but one of substance, where you sense the goodness of raising a family. Quiet, peaceful, safe—a sanctuary in its own right.\n\nWithin walking distance, the county sheriff's department stands guard, the health department by its side. Down the road, the city recycling center serves its people. Nearby, the crack of bats and the call of names echo from the fields, where baseball and softball games unfold. A small airport hums at the edge, planes taking off and landing, their rhythms a part of the town's pulse. Ice cream can be found with a short walk, and downtown is but a stretch of the legs away. My children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks distant. It is, indeed, a fine place to call home.",
            "The land where I abide could be likened to the endless rows of houses that stretch in ordered lines like soldiers on parade, each indistinguishable from the next. In this enclave, the hand of the homeowner's association is evident, their presence as palpable as the asphalt underfoot. As you cross the threshold, your eyes are met with the sight of homes cared for with a meticulousness that speaks of the association's watchful eye. Each yard a mirror to its neighbor, patches of manicured grass bordered by pebbles, driveways short and squat, trees that stand not much taller than a man grown. Garages built for two stand sentinel beside each home. As you wind your way through these streets, the concrete before you is smooth, unmarred by the scars of time or neglect. Here, the roads are kept as if new, a testament to the many families who call this place home, yet not one pothole mars the surface. The houses, mostly one story, but for the occasional two, rise like the modest dreams of their builders. The post is not delivered to the door as one might expect, but rather to a communal gathering of metal boxes at the street's end, each with its own key, that grants access to letters and parcels alike. Again, the association's preference for orderliness is to thank.  \n\nSituated at the city's far-flung edge, where suburb meets the till of country soil, there is room enough for all manner of things. Pools, clear and well-kept, lie behind their fences, open to all who dwell within. Paths wind through the land, inviting the solitary walker or the company of a dog. Here, exercise does not demand a park; the neighborhood's breadth is its own track. Retirees form the backbone of this place, their presence lending a sense of security and watchfulness. Yet among them are those younger, professionals still in the midst of their working years. The city beyond, though populous, retains the heart of a small town. It offers what one might need, including a solitary mall, sufficient in its humble way. The journey to the city's heart takes but a quarter of an hour, where stores of all kinds await, from the organic to the frugal, each serving its purpose in the tapestry of commerce. This neighborhood, in its quiet and well-tended way, embodies the spirit of safety and care. While not nestled among the shops, a short drive opens the world of commerce to one's choosing.",
            "It was the first I'd heard of the place, the tale of it come to me while listening to a podcast about folks vanished into thin air. That took me aback some. Seemed every flat in them parts was priced through the roof, over a thousand a month. Strange thing was, neither I nor my friends had caught wind of such a story. Maybe it’s the struggle, I reckon. Some nights, I know, there are those among us who find sleep only through tears. Life ain't cheap, but we've learned the art of making do. You come to find a fondness for the musty scent of flea market trinkets and clothes long sealed in camphor. Life smells less when you're grown. Perhaps you take up smoking, or maybe you just grow too used to the way of things. Yet the flea market, it never fails to make its presence known. The scent of adulthood is like old magazines piled atop a shut piano. It settles into the leather and lingers even after a good scrub. Round here, you’ve got three thrift stores within a stroll. From one end, you can make the rounds to a couple of charity shops, a library, a rare book nook, and a curio emporium. Downtown is a crush, cars and folks filling the streets each dawn, yet inside the thrifts, it’s hushed. No matter the throng outside, the shop holds its silence. A fine spot to lose the hours of a day. And every year, there are more of those. Cars and people surging through. They call it a burgeoning city. Headquarters to one of the largest online empires for trade and delivery, it's still finding its legs. Brings to mind New York, where everyone chases their own stars, asking little of you. Here, solitude and silence are your own, and they grant you that. Not like the South, where a touch of concern means you care. No prying into lives here, truly. You can keep your guard up as long as you see fit, and the city will go on crashing and receding like waves on the shore. It's a place alive with life. Between the pianist next door and the two aspiring singers above, there’s always some manner of song. In some ways, it feels less like a flat of strangers and more a fellowship of kin. We gather for our needs, mark birthdays, grieve our losses, lend a hand when we can. I count myself fortunate to be among them. I find a liking in most of my neighbors, and they seem to treat me kindly in turn. I mind my mess and share my food, and they return the favor. I fetch their mail and they mine. It gladdens me to see them, and I dare say they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I dwell in this sprawling, unfeeling modernity, but it's folk like my neighbors what make me feel I ain't completely botched my life.",
            "In a place where the flat lands stretch out beneath the big sky, I make my home. It's a small town in the Midwest, clinging to the edges of a city that looms with its glass and steel. This town, or at least the part where I reside, has seen better days. On the eastern edge, where the sun rises over tired houses, the economy has cast its shadow long and cold. The houses there are humble, some worn with the years, others held together by the dreams of those who barely own them.\n\nYet it is not a place without its charms. The folks here, they nod and smile as you pass by, a silent fellowship bound by shared circumstance. The streets whisper of events that have come and gone, the kind that leave a mark. Crimes have brushed past our lives like a chill wind, but they have not yet laid their claim on us. A young man was lost to a bullet not far from where I write, his parents now neighbors of ghostly sorrow.\n\nThe town, like many, bears the scars of a war fought not with guns but with needles and pills. The opioid plague has taken its due, lives snuffed out by the silent specter of fentanyl. But there are those who fight back, offering salvation in clinics and training sessions, a battle for souls in the guise of education and care.\n\nAnd still, life persists in small triumphs. My son, who walks a different path, finds solace in a school that embraces him. The people there, from the principal to the teachers, they nurture a community where no child is made to feel alone. The town's heart beats strongest in these small acts of kindness and provision, where no child is left hungry or shamed for lack of means.\n\nThe town council has set its sights on renewal, paving roads and planting new life in parks, though their gaze seldom falls on the east, where the old roads bear witness to neglect. It stirs a quiet discontent among us, those who call this side home.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, this town is where I choose to be. It holds a strange beauty, the people warm, the schools safe. The shops provide what's needed, and our home, though modest, holds a comfort that can't be measured in dollars. Sixteen years have passed since we first put down roots here, and the thought of leaving is as foreign as a distant land.",
            "In the old neighborhood there's a place where time seems to linger like the fog atop the hill. Buildings with histories etched in their bones stand watch, silent sentinels of a bygone era. My home is a seven-story edifice across the street from an ancient theater, its marquee long darkened. Down the hill a piece there's a place where people gather, an arcade bar, alive with the hum of summer's warmth, and the people, they come in droves when the nights stretch long and the air is like a balm. In June and July the line stretches down the block, a testament to the pull of light and laughter.\n\nUp the way a few blocks lies the park, a vast expanse given the confines of the city. Encased in concrete with great stone steps hewn with purpose. In winter's grip, the homeless stake their claims, erecting shelters in rows along the sidewalks and those steps. The snow, it seldom falls, but the rain comes with a vengeance, and it seeps into the very marrow of the bone. Their tents, clustered close, offer warmth to those who choose the city over the wild. For them, the family center, a place where the dignity of a shower is within reach, stands just a few blocks further.\n\nThe city's beauty is not lost on me, the architecture a testament to human endeavor, but it is the pulse of the people that draws me in. Hilltop, a name that once whispered fear in the hearts of those who heard it, tales of violence and the sweep of federal brooms trying to cleanse it. Yet the stories linger, passed down like heirlooms, and the memory of those days still hangs in the air. The people here, they labor under the weight of history, striving to keep the streets clean, to hold onto a sense of pride. Whispers persist, warnings not to walk these streets after dark, but I find them echoes of a time past, shadows cast by the light of fear and ignorance.\n\nPerhaps the Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the scars that mark this nation. For all its claims of being a melting pot, the city bears the stains of division, ignorance festering beneath the surface. Yet here, in this place I call home, there's a certain aliveness in the night air, a sense of belonging. I've walked these streets and found kindness in unexpected places, a jacket offered against the chill, a laundromat open late for a moment of respite. I've sat in the rain, believing myself unseen, only to be met with a gaze that said otherwise, a hand that offered a gift and a word of affirmation. In Hilltop, I find the threads of humanity woven tight, a tapestry of lives intermingled, and in that, there is a beauty all its own.",
            "I come to this place when the world was still young to me, just before the eighth grade, and the echoes of its streets were unfamiliar. At first, the solitude was a companion, a whisper in the shadowed alleys of my mind, but in time I found solace in the company of a boy two doors down and another who walked the same stretch of road. They are gone now, but their ghosts linger in the quietude of memory. The neighborhood, a tapestry of American suburbia, remains with its two-story houses standing like sentinels under the indifferent sky. Weekends, when warmth spills over the earth, children’s laughter threads the air like a hymn, but most days silence reigns. The people here, they leave you be unless you call upon them. Trust is woven into the very fabric of the place, unspoken yet steadfast. Not once has my porch been robbed of its parcels, and this speaks to something deeper than mere words. A stone's throw away lies a park, a repository of my youthful endeavors. Basketball, football, baseball—the games we played beneath the sun's watchful gaze. It holds the shadow of pain too, the sharp memory of a broken nose, yet the light outweighs the dark. Now, I walk there with my cousin's children, their laughter a bridge to the past as they swing and slide with abandon. Nostalgia, a gentle specter, walks beside me. Diversity colors this neighborhood in myriad shades. Within a mile's reach, flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy beckon. Fast food reigns supreme, as is the way of suburbia, and pizza places dot the landscape. The stores, they are filled with everything a soul might seek. Dry cleaners aplenty, a Walgreens, a CVS, and the Jewel-Osco that anchors the street, its name a familiar song in the Midwest. Even here, diversity whispers its presence with an Indian-owned store for those who crave the taste of home. In all, this place is a balm to the tales of discord and discontent that echo from the screens of social media. For this, I am grateful.",
            "The neighborhood rose up around the college like some old sentinel, watchful and weary. Apartments stood like sentinels themselves, blocks of stone and brick, whispering the secrets of the many who have passed through their halls. A smattering of restaurants and bars, their lights flickering like phantoms in the night, offered solace to weary souls. One bar got itself a new name, a fresh coat of paint, and with it, a price that spoke of aspirations above its station, though the spirits within were no less potent for the change. The folks here, they are mostly youth with the fire of future dreams burning bright, or those who scrape by, the cost of living a cruel arbiter. The streets ring with the laughter of children, a school just a stone’s throw away, its walls echoing with the promise and potential of youth.\n\nI share walls with neighbors I do not know, nor care to. Their smoke seeps through the walls, mingling with the air of my abode, so much so that management saw fit to place a mask of fragrance by their door. My partner and I, we chuckled at the absurdity of it. Insulting? Perhaps, and yet here we are. The buildings around me bear the mark of age, their facades worn and weary, yet inside, some hold a surprise of modernity. Down the road, in contrast, are the new pretenders, apartments gleaming with promise but built on foundations of deceit. Their allure is but a façade, yet they stand near the heart of learning, their cost justified by proximity rather than quality.\n\nThere’s a diner nearby, a place where sustenance is served on paper, with the hum of microwaves a constant chorus. Across from it stands a gas station, a place of toil that bears its own stories of hardship. Yet, the city paid its due, and the roads were made anew, ribbons of concrete bordered by green, a touch of civility amidst the urban sprawl. My dwelling is enfolded in trees, though some have fallen to the axe, leaving their stumps as silent witnesses. Beyond the tree line, more apartments rise, and further still lies 43rd street, a place where neglect has taken root. The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings worn, and the trees stand as veils to what lies beneath. Crime finds its den there, though it is not alone in its claim.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, I find contentment in my abode. It stands within reach of the university, a beacon of knowledge a mere walk away. Two bus stops lie at my feet, paths to the wider world, to stores and the heart of the city. In this place, I find a balance of necessity and convenience, a life tethered to a place I can call home.",
            "In a small enclave of duplexes, the cul-de-sac lay like a forgotten relic of another time. The houses, though intended to stand alone, bore the uniformity of their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, each a mirror of the next and yet distinct in the way they absorbed the sun and shadow. There was a camaraderie among the inhabitants, a quiet understanding forged in the simple act of gathering at the end of an undecided driveway. Evenings found us there, where children played with toys and chalk and kites under a sky vast and indifferent, and the world seemed less burdened by the machinations of modern life.\n\nThe landscape stretched out in fields and trees, an expanse softened by the blue of the heavens and the drifting clouds. But this season brought with it a portentous air, the promise of storms brewing in the distance. The sirens wailed their mournful warning, a sound not yet familiar but soon to be, and so we sought shelter. In the bathtub, clutching the smallest dog like a talisman, I hunkered down with my purse and a few pillows. The big dog, obstinate in his fear, barked at the storm from the living room, his voice rising against the hail that fell like judgment upon the earth. \n\nWhen the storm passed, the road steamed in the wake of the tempest, the hail dissolving upon the hot pavement as if it had never been. The sun broke through clearing skies, and rain fell softly, conjuring a double rainbow that arced over the quiet street. I captured the moment with a camera, a testament to share with friends and kin, a marvel that left us all in awe. An hour passed in silence before life resumed its rhythm, as mothers and children reappeared, drawn outside by the promise of dinner and the fading light. For a newcomer from the North, this place was a balm, its southern drawl a music that I was beginning to love.\n\nThe apartment I called home was like the others, two bedrooms and two baths, yet inside, they varied in space and comfort, a mystery among many. Behind the dwellings lay a great field, inviting me to wander to the edge of the pond, a place not meant for swimming. In the early hours, the deer moved in silence, and the bullfrog's song resonated across the stillness of morning. It was a sanctuary, just forty minutes from the city of Charlotte, where the rooster's crow heralded the dawn and a donkey's bray signaled the coming night. This was my fortune, to have stumbled upon such a place, a small community unto itself, a gem in the rough-hewn fabric of the South.",
            "In the ten long years since I came to this place, I reckon I’ve learned a thing or two worth telling. The day I left Riverdale for Stockbridge was a sorrowful one. I cried for the parting of familiar faces and places, and though it stung, my folks believed it was for the best. They wanted something better for me and my sister, a place where a home was more than a roof and a high school was more than a building. So we moved from what some called ghetto to something else entirely. \n\nOver time, I grew accustomed to this new land of ours, found friends and foes in the halls of the school. Yet, I never came to know the neighbors too well, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, and Dennis too for a spell. They lived right next door, and in their company, I found a semblance of family. I hold dear the memory of attending Mr. Glen’s wedding, or rather his re-marriage, with my folks and sister. It was a day of joy, a glimpse into a future I hope to craft for myself, where the woman beside me lives like a queen. I remember catching the garter but not the flowers, a small whimsy of fate. We danced until the night grew old, and in that dance, I shared a moment with Marsharii, one of Glen’s daughters. She’s gone her way since, and I hope it’s led her to greater things.\n\nThe neighborhood itself sprawls like a maze, though a GPS now guides my ventures through its winding paths. I have wandered far as I dared, often with Kason and Curtis by my side. We spent hours lost in games and laughter, seeking joy wherever it hid. Sometimes, I find peace in the park, where nature’s quiet balm soothes the soul. There, I balance on sticks from the Home Depot and wield my bokken sword, playing at ancient arts. There’s a court for basketball and tennis too, though it’s been years since I’ve played. My father instilled a love for tennis in me and my best friend, under the watchful eye of Mr. Graves. Those were days of labor and laughter, and the memory of them lingers still.\n\nThere are many memories here, tales of a life lived and moments cherished, but these are the ones that linger in my mind. And I reckon the finest days are still ahead.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town named Johnston, a place unremarkable in the eyes of the world yet bearing the quiet pride of a locale that calls itself the Peach Capital. This is not written on the stones of history but on a weathered sign that greets you at the threshold. The land stretches out, vast and silent, orchards of peach trees standing in solemn rows, cattle wandering the pastures. Houses rise sporadically from the earth, two-story sentinels clad in metal roofs to fend off the relentless summer sun or the more subdued gray shingles. They sit back from the ribbon of road, yielding their fields to the toil of men and the seasons' yield.\n\nAt the heart of the town, there hangs a stoplight, a solitary guardian over the crossroads where the few stores gather. Here, you find sustenance in places like Hong Kong, a humble Chinese eatery kept by one family, or Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger haven. The pizzeria, once a member of this ensemble, has since shuttered its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny pharmacy known not for its prescriptions but for the Cherry Coca-Cola it dispenses, stands as a relic of small-town commerce. The IGA, a grocery store, holds its ground, though folks often venture to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their larger needs. Dollar General, the town's bustling hub, draws the people with its promise of everyday essentials, its doors swinging open to the constant flow of residents.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a small venture under the stewardship of a kindly woman, offers not just furnishings but the service of two movers, delivering comforts to scattered homes. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures, a small domain of grooming and care. A doctor and a veterinarian work in small practices, their hands skilled in tending to the ailments of both man and beast, set apart from the town's core.\n\nJohnston Elementary School stands as the lone institution of early learning, sending its children forth to neighboring towns for continued education. Parks are but a dream in progress, a 2.5-acre promise of recreation and respite, a hope to draw more souls to this quiet enclave. The town lacks the diversions of a larger world—no theaters, no alleys for bowling, no sanctuaries of leisure or playgrounds for the young. Yet in its simplicity, there lies a charm, a fleeting existence that might escape the notice of those who pass by, but lingers in the hearts of those who call it home.",
            "In the small southern town of Tennessee, where the suburbs stretch out like an old quilt, a road runs between two highways bringing a touch more traffic than one might desire. Yet it's a place of quietude, a neighborhood where folks are known and seldom change. The faces are familiar, their habits too, like the sound of rakes in fall or the hum of lawnmowers cutting grass till October's end. \n\nOur house sits at the corner, watching the world pass by. We know the cars and the people, and we mark the strangers like a whisper of wind through the trees. Dogs are walked, children weave their bicycles through the streets, and we too are part of this rhythm, my wife and I, and our two daughters, growing tall in the shadow of the trees. We work from home, and our comings and goings are as known to others as theirs are to us. \n\nThe grill on the back deck smokes with the promise of barbecue, mingling with the scent of burning leaves that heralds the coming of fall. The winters have grown light, more like an extended autumn, and in these days the garage at the back of the house becomes my retreat. There I tinker with my truck, the open doors a window into the life that moves around me. \n\nHolidays pass in quietude, save for the gatherings that bring a scatter of unfamiliar cars. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas, they come and go like leaves on the wind. And though the street carries more than its share of travelers, this place is home, a haven of sorts, and if only it were not a through street, it might be near perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert there lies a neighborhood, a place where the land stretches out in a vast expanse of dust and sand and the relentless sun beats down upon the earth. To live here is to know the color of the world is a ceaseless brown, save for the rare green of a lawn that speaks of extravagance and toil. In the days when I first settled here in the nineties, the houses were scattered far and wide across the parched land. Though time has brought new faces and structures, the essence remains unchanged, a city rising slowly from the dust.\n\nThe people of this place are mostly kind, a testament to the spirit of the desert, but like any city, it holds its shadows. My neighbors are the old guard, friendly souls who have seen the desert change and remain steadfast in their ways. The stores here are the familiar chains, offering the staples of life, yet if one seeks the finer things, the journey must extend beyond this enclave.\n\nConstruction is the lifeblood of this place, a testament to the untamed spaces that still await man's ambition. I find a certain unease in this, for I cherish the quiet expanse that surrounds us. My own craft lies in this realm, a maker of walls and ceilings, yet I hold a fondness for the creatures that call this land home. The desert is a place of stark beauty, a fragile ecosystem that harbors life both strange and marvelous. My children, wild as the lizards they chase, delight in the desert's offerings, their laughter mingling with the wind.\n\nAmidst this rugged landscape, there are places to see and things to do. Victorville offers its own brand of allure, a chance to witness the desert's majesty, especially when the San Bernardino County Fair arrives, bringing with it a sense of festivity and wonder. Not far lies Wrightwood, where the mountains stand tall and cloaked in snow, a place for those who seek the thrill of winter’s sport.\n\nFor those drawn to the stories of the land, the Victor Valley Museum holds the keys to the past, with its geological treasures and relics of those who walked this ground before us. Here, the tales of the desert unfold, chronicling the journey of those who dared to make a life in this unforgiving place.",
            "When they ask about my neighborhood, the description that comes forth may seem set apart from the rest. For there are those who speak from the vantage of homeowners, anchored in lives of their own making. Yet mine is a path that diverges a shade. My neighborhood is the college campus upon which I reside, and the souls housed in the dormitory are the kinship I know. The campus that envelopes it all is part of my claim, though it holds a subtler tether.\n\nDespite this oddity, my neighborhood bears the echoes of what is deemed conventional. Like any neighborhood drawn in the mind's eye, mine too holds houses, people, stores, and parks. Let us first turn our gaze to the \"houses\" that make up this place I call home. Before the exploration begins, clarity calls for the kinds of dwellings found here. There are three: the apartments, the real houses, and the dormitory houses. \n\nIn the apartments, where space is shared, you find two to four souls to a room, and four to six rooms claim a floor. These buildings stretch to two floors, harboring twenty lives within their walls. Then come the actual houses, open to those tied to the school. These are two to four-bedroom affairs, often lodgings for alumni. They are scattered few, a testament to their lesser efficiency. Finally, the dormitories rise, where hundreds stake their claim. Here, two share a room, and it is the common abode in my vicinity.\n\nWith the matter of housing laid bare, we turn to the people. My school stands proud in its diversity, and this tapestry is mirrored in my neighborhood's essence. From varied cultures and ages, they gather. Professional staff find homes in the houses, new students in dormitories, and the elder students in apartments. Words fall short of capturing their essence, so we move on to the stores and parks that embellish the land.\n\nThe school, its own self-contained realm, offers a trove of stores and a singular park. The stores blend dining as found in any land, alongside the school's own unique offerings of attire and provisions. Thus, all that one seeks lies within the bounds of this neighborhood. The park stands as a playground for the diverse souls that dwell here, kept pure and safe by the watchful care of its community.",
            "In the place where I live, sidewalks are scarce and the land slopes away like the skin of some great beast. My house perches atop the neighborhood's steepest rise, a humpbacked hill that folks have christened the \"work out hill\" for the way it draws joggers to its incline. Sidewalks are absent, and so the people tread the asphalt path, a road pocked and worn, treacherous in its own right. The wires of telephone and electricity sag overhead, frayed by the elements, a testimony to the bouts of rain and storm that lash the place. Branches fall with regularity, striking down the lines till they bear the look of patchwork. \n\nEvergreens stand tall and indifferent, their green a defiance of the sky’s gray. Yet the people here harbor no love for them, for they are but obstructions to the ocean's expanse. Houses rise on the hill, each tiered higher than the last, their glass facades hungering for the bay’s view. Come sunset, the waters burn with light drawn from some inner fire, the sky awash in orange. More oft than not, though, the clouds drape low, a haze through which sunlight strains to reach. The days are damp, casting a pall of moss upon all it can claim: roofs, cars, railings. Once my own car, left to languish in the drive, grew a coat of green that cost me three hours to scrape away.\n\nChildren are a rarity in these parts, though a school stands but blocks away. The inhabitants are mostly older folk, veterans of life's work, settled into retirement. Their companions are creatures of four legs, dogs that populate lawns and race down streets in spirited chase. Leave open a door or window at your own peril, for they may wander unbidden indoors. I once found one in my parlor, needing to shoo it back out into the world. Rabbits too roam freely, their numbers swelling till the gardeners curse them for the holes they dig and the havoc they wreak. My cats find them sport, thinning their ranks with tireless zeal. Above, the sky belongs to the birds, sparrows and hummingbirds flitting about, while the occasional hawk or eagle dares the crows’ ire.\n\nStores are a distant promise, but down the slope at the waterfront lie eateries where the sea’s bounty is served fresh. The beach is but a thin line, its stones inviting the hand to hurl them into the bay. The bay itself is a narrow thing, the far shore visible even through the mist’s shroud on most days.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies Bensonhurst, a place easy enough to find if you're set on it. The veins of the city run deep and wide through its streets, public transport threading these pathways with the constancy of a river. The urban sprawl of New York City does not relent here, and in its embrace, you will find Bensonhurst much the same, a hub where cultures intertwine and histories linger in every corner shop and park bench.\n\nThe scent of the Orient wafts through the air, for in recent times, the Asians have come in numbers, staking their claim upon the landscape with markets and laundromats, their signs a testament to a changing world. Each block tells a story of enterprise and migration, where the wares of the East meet the appetites of the West. Imposing supermarkets stand sentinel, their offerings rich and varied, and the price fair enough to draw even the most discerning of patrons. The convenience of it all is undeniable. Four markets, no more than a stone's throw from one another, speak to the abundance that lies at one's feet.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not a monolith, not solely the domain of one people. It is a tapestry woven with threads of many hues, immigrants mingling with the offspring of their dreams, the children of America’s promise. Still, the Asian presence is pronounced, their endeavors dotting the landscape like stars in a night sky.\n\nThe park, freshly renewed, offers respite and play, a place where the young and the restless find their sport. Courts ring with the echoes of games, fields stretch green and wide. In summer's heat, the fountain's spray beckons, a siren's call to laughter and delight. Here, diversity finds its voice, children of every origin finding common ground in the simple joy of play.\n\nBuildings rise in modest stature, co-ops and condominiums, homes for the many who seek shelter here. Mostly, it is the two-family houses that stand, their occupants as varied as the city itself. The people, kind enough in their way, fill the air with the noise of their lives, the music of engines and the symphony of city living. \n\nWhen the sun sets, the city reveals another face. Safety is a relative term, a fragile thing. Shadows move in the night, and caution is a companion one should not abandon. The specter of trouble lingers; I have known it myself, in days past when violence found me unawares. Thieves too, ever opportunistic, ply their trade, absconding with that which is not theirs.\n\nThe streets bear witness to another neglect, the disregard for the law concerning the waste of dogs. A daily presence, it mars the path to the station, an unwelcome reminder of the shortcomings of civic duty. In Bensonhurst, as elsewhere, vigilance is key, lest your soles bear the brunt of another’s disregard.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, there lies a whisper of strangeness, a notion tethered to the bones of the city, not unlike a ghost that refuses to abandon its haunt. The phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\" is scrawled upon the rear of a building that plays many roles—a pizzeria, a tavern, a stage for music, a dim-lit den where the law is more suggestion than rule. It is both a lament for a bygone Portland of the nineties and early aughts, when the city was a secret known only to those within its embrace, and an invitation to those who seek solace in the peculiar. To be called weird here is to be given a badge of honor, a mark of belonging to a tribe that holds the unusual in high regard.\n\nThe city, despite the tide of wealthy newcomers from the southlands and the rising towers of habitation built to house them, retains its oddities. To be weird is not always to be welcoming, yet it allows for the acceptance of that which the world might cast aside. Like any other city, it bears the marks of modernity, the goods from distant shores, the struggles that mirror those of its nation. Portland is a tapestry of the extraordinary and the mundane, woven with threads of yoga mats and vinyl records, suits and startups. To be weird might simply mean to carry all this with a measure of levity.\n\nIn the quarters where I dwell, bright abodes stand in rows, gardens bursting with herbs and blossoms, and the sidewalks are lined with the offerings of free boxes. These are not mere containers but vessels of possibility, often filled with garments and tomes, waiting for the passerby to claim their unexpected fortune. This discovery, this serendipity, is the essence of Portland, though my version of it is but one among a multitude. There are those who eschew the sidewalk's bounty, opting instead for goat yoga—where creatures with hooves share the mat—or the roar of Timbers games.\n\nThe city is a mosaic of passions and pursuits, dreams chased and dreams deferred, often over a pint too many. Shadows linger over Portland, cast by the weight of addiction and the specter of homelessness, ailments of the mind and spirit exacerbated by the relentless rain and brooding skies. The city offers a refuge of sorts, its services a beacon to those adrift, yet they fall short, as do the hearts of its citizens, who oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this, Portland is not peculiar at all, but a reflection of a broader human condition.",
            "The mountains stood eternal, immutable, watchmen of the north. Each dawn they rose to greet the sun and each dusk they bade it farewell. No matter the forgetfulness of man or the distractions of his labor, they endure, unyielding and indifferent to the petty strife of mortal life. In the moments when the world pressed too hard upon me, clawing at my nerves, they called me to witness them. In their silent majesty, I found a balm for my restless spirit, a quiet strength to carry me forward, one footfall after the next. I came here first as a young scholar, drawn to the northern slopes that loomed over the campus like ancient sentinels. True, the university was a place of beauty in its own right, with its grand edifices and tranquil ponds, its noble trees. Yet, it was the mountains that claimed my heart, their throne unchallenged. The town itself, with its charming cafés that were sanctuaries of caffeine and late-night study, was not without its allure. A short walk or bus ride to the heart of downtown, and one found themselves amidst the faded bricks, steeped in the aura of ages. Here the town shed its suburban skin, revealing a pulse of life akin to the city's urban heart. But the bustle was brief, a few blocks of clamor before the quietude returned, slipping past the library into the hushed streets once more. This juxtaposition, this mingling of worlds, lent the city an air of mystery, a silent invitation to wander and discover. In such a place, memories are woven into the fabric of existence. There were nights spent under the stars, laughing with friends by rusted swings, and mad dashes through crowded streets to catch a film, the tickets a gift from the university. Yet, as with all places touched by time, there were shadows too, memories that cut deeper. The ponds, often a mirror for reflection, were also the setting for my darkest hours, a sanctuary for tears shed under the moon's pale light. It was there, in the solitude of night, amid the turtles and the ducks, that I pondered my place in the grand design, grappling with the enigma of being. So I wandered, past the pond, through the park and the quiet houses, until the main street beckoned. As the sun cast its golden glow upon the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of dawn, I realized my path led northward. There they were, steadfast and unchanging. The mountains, vast and timeless, brushed the heavens with their peaks, more enduring than any man-made tower. In their silent presence, I found my resolve, a quiet voice urging me onward, ever onward.",
            "You might pass it by in a moment’s glance, a place unseen and unheeded. A residential quarter tucked behind the commerce of the world, not a place meant for living, or so it seems. But wander past the vacant husk of an old Whole Foods, skirting the hotels that stand like sentinels abandoned save for the bustling of summer kinships, and you will uncover a hidden thrum of life. Streets lined with apartments, stacked close like Russian dolls laid bare and set in their order, a slow unfolding down the lane. The first you find have whispered tales of ill repute, the kind that live in the shadows, but we’ll leave those for another time, for truth can hide beneath the veils of rumor. The ones beside them, and those beyond, hold tales untold, a world apart from the knowing eyes of most. Across from them, a satellite of learning stands, quiet and solemn, where the young trudge in with the morning’s first light, coffee in hand, battling the waking hours. The iron gates groan their welcome as they filter through, the road outside a cacophony of grumbling commuters, the dance of traffic held fast on busier days. The street comes to halt at another, where a park stretches out, and a center for healing those whose bones have met misfortune. There, porch chairs sit in the sun, a ceiling fan lazily stirring the heavy summer air. Children flit across the park’s expanse, a blur of life against the green, bees floating languid in the patchwork of flowers by the road. Old souls shuffle along with their dogs, frowning at the youths on their boards, nodding at the clusters of girls whispering their secrets of boys and online fame. Beside the park, in a strip mall, a sushi place offers its wares, a quiet affair, with a swimming supply store and a nail salon nestled close. Here, one could ready their pool, adorn their nails, and feast on hibachi in a single afternoon—a testament to the strip mall’s peculiar charm. There is a place for frozen yogurt too, where the young gather, clutching their chilled confections as they skate and vape in a bid for coolness. This neighborhood is a quiet echo of Americana, a slow-moving river of time where change comes with great reluctance, if at all.",
            "In the quiet sprawl of my neighborhood, there lies an old story stitched into the very earth. The houses stand solitary, mostly, though here and there you find one cleaved in two yet joined like a pair of weary twins. My own home, it sits with a modest yard before it and a narrow driveway to the side, a relic of a time when the dream was more than just a memory flickering on the edge of darkness. Once this dream cradled the soul of a nation, yet now it seems to drift away like smoke on the wind. But here, in this place, it lingers still, a whisper to those who will listen, a promise that has not yet faded entirely. The people, though, wear the years heavily, their hope not as bright as it once was. The little yards no longer tended with the care they once knew. Yet cars idle in the driveways, and the children play as if this world were all they would ever need, their laughter the pulse of the street. The school, standing for nearly ninety years, remains a bastion of futures yet to be and memories long past. Churches are sparse, their pews empty, but the courts echo with the beat of basketballs. These homes, different to the eye, share a sameness in their bones. There is a supermarket, grandly named Super A, owned by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs here, while most who walk these streets are African American. The roads are broad, and the children play football, pausing only to let the cars pass in their slow procession. Many here can speak of days gone by when all knew each other by name. Once there was a karate school, but the dreams of being a karate kid faded with the films, and now it is a pharmacy, for in these times, medicine is the balm for all ills, or so it is said. A small theater remains, showing old reels to the delight of elders, an escape from the young who crave the new. An expressway cuts through the land, but its exits lie elsewhere, a decision fought over, the young in favor, the old against, fearing the change it might bring. Now a new high school rises, and we ponder a mascot fitting for our town. Perhaps a cyborg with a southern drawl and a log cabin at its heart would do us justice, a blend of the old and the new, as we are.",
            "In the sprawl of the great city, where the streets snake and twist like old riverbeds carved through stone, the neighborhood stands in its manifold diversity. Between the looming edifices of commerce, there lay scattered domiciles, each nestled in its own peculiar corner. The businesses rise like sentinels, offices and stores and eateries, a panoply of trade and sustenance. There is no famine of new taverns to patronize, nor shops to wander through. Some of these are grand emporiums, the offspring of distant corporate giants, yet among them, small boutiques flourish, their presence a testament to the city's eclectic soul. They line the streets like sentries, their windows reflecting the quietude of nearby residences, which might remain tranquil were it not for the clamor of the city's heartbeat. Parks, green and solemn, offer respite amidst the chaos, where families gather, children laughing in the sun's embrace.\n\nThe people, too, are a tapestry of life woven from threads of countless origins. There in a single breath of space, the LGBTQ+ community finds its voice, the Orthodox Jews uphold their ancient rites, and refugees from lands once bound by the Soviet yoke seek new beginnings. Beyond this enclave, the city unfurls further, revealing enclaves named for distant lands—Korea, China, Armenia—each a world unto itself, yet mere miles apart. But in this city, a mile can stretch long as a lifetime, the roads choked with the ceaseless tide of vehicles, a pilgrimage of metal and exhaust. Few choose to walk, for the city is vast and implacable, and the foot is slow. Thus the roads become rivers of steel, parking a mirage ever just out of reach.\n\nDespite it all, the city's allure draws newcomers, and with them the rising towers of construction, a skyline ever-changing. The prospect of yet more souls and their chariots stirs discontent among the settled. But the diversity of dwellings remains—houses of every shape and size, apartments and condominiums, single-family abodes, and duplexes—all testament to the city's varied heart. In the midst of it, the community, a mosaic of ages and faces, is not as it once was. The bonds that held neighbor to neighbor have loosened, memories of childhood games in the sun now shadows of the past, when the streets were alive with the voices of youth.",
            "She looked out at the endless stretch of cornfields, a horizon unbroken save for the occasional silo, and asked, Where is everything? And I told her, This is it. Her eyes wide with the wonder of it. She came from a town where the grocery store was but a stone's throw from her door, and never had she beheld such expanse. I spoke to her of growing up in the wide plains of rural Ohio, and in that sharing, she understood a piece of me, the place that shaped me.  \n\nWe traveled the narrow ribbon of road that wound its way through the land, past a quarry filled with still water, and came upon my small settlement. The houses stood, mostly brick and stucco, each cradled by the earth with a half-acre of land for its own. Folks took pride in the care of that land, tending to it as if it were kin. Spring would come, and with it, the flowers, planted anew each year, and the trees that spoke of the seasons' change.  \n\nIn the driveways rested the polished chariots, gleaming under the midday sun, Mercedes Benz, the pride of their owners. As we continued, my grey stucco home came into view, and there was my neighbor, the Korean man with the kind eyes, always outside with a nod and a smile. He'd spend his days with mower and song, and his joy became the music of the place. Age had softened him some, but in his past, he was a healer, a doctor, though now he seemed a part of the earth itself.  \n\nWe reached my home, where the geese wandered the side yard, taunted by our Terrier. Behind, a small stream whispered its way to the quarry, the bullfrogs sang their chorus, and the distant cows lent their voices to the day. Across a simple wooden bridge lay an untouched world, a sanctuary of wild growth, herbs and flowers untamed.  \n\nHere was the heart of my childhood, where forts were built in trees and the chase of critters was my hunt. Always there was something to be done, a companion to be found in one of the neighborhood children. Winters came with their own harsh beauty, the green fields turned to a stark, barren land. Snow, when it blessed us, transformed all into a wonderland. My sister and I would fashion angels in the drifts and build men of snow. We fought, as siblings do, our snowballs the ammunition of youth.  \n\nIn our snowbound fortress, we played our games, a world of pretend where nothing else existed, just two children amid the silence of the winter, the world beyond forgotten."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit.

            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, there lies a small town in Michigan, where fields stretch out to touch quaint tourist hamlets. There are no sprawling malls nor the bright lights of Wal-mart or Target, not even the hum of an Applebee's. To reach anywhere, one must drive, yet this place stands among the most beautiful in the world, cradled by water on all sides. My town is flanked by the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. Wherever your feet may wander, a beach waits to welcome them. \n\nThe neighborhood is a testament to small-town life. Houses breathe with space between them, not the uniform sameness of modern developments. Some are relics, lovingly restored, while others bear the marks of age. Most have full basements visible from the street. Time has clad many in aluminum siding, and each home stands painted in a spectrum that defies imagination. Yards stretch out with their own stories, trampolines and playsets dot the landscape. Gardens grow, and fences keep watch over their charges. These homes speak of Middle America, of those who toil and labor, raising families or having seen them grow and leave.\n\nOn any day, the streets are alive with children, their laughter echoing. Dogs trot beside their owners, bicycles whir past, and rollerblades skim the pavement. Neighbors nod in recognition, a quiet understanding of who belongs and who does not. The scent of grilling drifts by, a wave exchanged between strangers who are not quite strangers. Lawns lie neat, leaves banished with the passing of fall. Grass grows green and the plants are neatly trimmed. It is not a place of grandeur but one of substance, where you sense the goodness of raising a family. Quiet, peaceful, safe—a sanctuary in its own right.\n\nWithin walking distance, the county sheriff's department stands guard, the health department by its side. Down the road, the city recycling center serves its people. Nearby, the crack of bats and the call of names echo from the fields, where baseball and softball games unfold. A small airport hums at the edge, planes taking off and landing, their rhythms a part of the town's pulse. Ice cream can be found with a short walk, and downtown is but a stretch of the legs away. My children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks distant. It is, indeed, a fine place to call home.",
            "The land where I abide could be likened to the endless rows of houses that stretch in ordered lines like soldiers on parade, each indistinguishable from the next. In this enclave, the hand of the homeowner's association is evident, their presence as palpable as the asphalt underfoot. As you cross the threshold, your eyes are met with the sight of homes cared for with a meticulousness that speaks of the association's watchful eye. Each yard a mirror to its neighbor, patches of manicured grass bordered by pebbles, driveways short and squat, trees that stand not much taller than a man grown. Garages built for two stand sentinel beside each home. As you wind your way through these streets, the concrete before you is smooth, unmarred by the scars of time or neglect. Here, the roads are kept as if new, a testament to the many families who call this place home, yet not one pothole mars the surface. The houses, mostly one story, but for the occasional two, rise like the modest dreams of their builders. The post is not delivered to the door as one might expect, but rather to a communal gathering of metal boxes at the street's end, each with its own key, that grants access to letters and parcels alike. Again, the association's preference for orderliness is to thank.  \n\nSituated at the city's far-flung edge, where suburb meets the till of country soil, there is room enough for all manner of things. Pools, clear and well-kept, lie behind their fences, open to all who dwell within. Paths wind through the land, inviting the solitary walker or the company of a dog. Here, exercise does not demand a park; the neighborhood's breadth is its own track. Retirees form the backbone of this place, their presence lending a sense of security and watchfulness. Yet among them are those younger, professionals still in the midst of their working years. The city beyond, though populous, retains the heart of a small town. It offers what one might need, including a solitary mall, sufficient in its humble way. The journey to the city's heart takes but a quarter of an hour, where stores of all kinds await, from the organic to the frugal, each serving its purpose in the tapestry of commerce. This neighborhood, in its quiet and well-tended way, embodies the spirit of safety and care. While not nestled among the shops, a short drive opens the world of commerce to one's choosing.",
            "It was the first I'd heard of the place, the tale of it come to me while listening to a podcast about folks vanished into thin air. That took me aback some. Seemed every flat in them parts was priced through the roof, over a thousand a month. Strange thing was, neither I nor my friends had caught wind of such a story. Maybe it’s the struggle, I reckon. Some nights, I know, there are those among us who find sleep only through tears. Life ain't cheap, but we've learned the art of making do. You come to find a fondness for the musty scent of flea market trinkets and clothes long sealed in camphor. Life smells less when you're grown. Perhaps you take up smoking, or maybe you just grow too used to the way of things. Yet the flea market, it never fails to make its presence known. The scent of adulthood is like old magazines piled atop a shut piano. It settles into the leather and lingers even after a good scrub. Round here, you’ve got three thrift stores within a stroll. From one end, you can make the rounds to a couple of charity shops, a library, a rare book nook, and a curio emporium. Downtown is a crush, cars and folks filling the streets each dawn, yet inside the thrifts, it’s hushed. No matter the throng outside, the shop holds its silence. A fine spot to lose the hours of a day. And every year, there are more of those. Cars and people surging through. They call it a burgeoning city. Headquarters to one of the largest online empires for trade and delivery, it's still finding its legs. Brings to mind New York, where everyone chases their own stars, asking little of you. Here, solitude and silence are your own, and they grant you that. Not like the South, where a touch of concern means you care. No prying into lives here, truly. You can keep your guard up as long as you see fit, and the city will go on crashing and receding like waves on the shore. It's a place alive with life. Between the pianist next door and the two aspiring singers above, there’s always some manner of song. In some ways, it feels less like a flat of strangers and more a fellowship of kin. We gather for our needs, mark birthdays, grieve our losses, lend a hand when we can. I count myself fortunate to be among them. I find a liking in most of my neighbors, and they seem to treat me kindly in turn. I mind my mess and share my food, and they return the favor. I fetch their mail and they mine. It gladdens me to see them, and I dare say they enjoy my company as much as I do theirs. I dwell in this sprawling, unfeeling modernity, but it's folk like my neighbors what make me feel I ain't completely botched my life.",
            "In a place where the flat lands stretch out beneath the big sky, I make my home. It's a small town in the Midwest, clinging to the edges of a city that looms with its glass and steel. This town, or at least the part where I reside, has seen better days. On the eastern edge, where the sun rises over tired houses, the economy has cast its shadow long and cold. The houses there are humble, some worn with the years, others held together by the dreams of those who barely own them.\n\nYet it is not a place without its charms. The folks here, they nod and smile as you pass by, a silent fellowship bound by shared circumstance. The streets whisper of events that have come and gone, the kind that leave a mark. Crimes have brushed past our lives like a chill wind, but they have not yet laid their claim on us. A young man was lost to a bullet not far from where I write, his parents now neighbors of ghostly sorrow.\n\nThe town, like many, bears the scars of a war fought not with guns but with needles and pills. The opioid plague has taken its due, lives snuffed out by the silent specter of fentanyl. But there are those who fight back, offering salvation in clinics and training sessions, a battle for souls in the guise of education and care.\n\nAnd still, life persists in small triumphs. My son, who walks a different path, finds solace in a school that embraces him. The people there, from the principal to the teachers, they nurture a community where no child is made to feel alone. The town's heart beats strongest in these small acts of kindness and provision, where no child is left hungry or shamed for lack of means.\n\nThe town council has set its sights on renewal, paving roads and planting new life in parks, though their gaze seldom falls on the east, where the old roads bear witness to neglect. It stirs a quiet discontent among us, those who call this side home.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, this town is where I choose to be. It holds a strange beauty, the people warm, the schools safe. The shops provide what's needed, and our home, though modest, holds a comfort that can't be measured in dollars. Sixteen years have passed since we first put down roots here, and the thought of leaving is as foreign as a distant land.",
            "In the old neighborhood there's a place where time seems to linger like the fog atop the hill. Buildings with histories etched in their bones stand watch, silent sentinels of a bygone era. My home is a seven-story edifice across the street from an ancient theater, its marquee long darkened. Down the hill a piece there's a place where people gather, an arcade bar, alive with the hum of summer's warmth, and the people, they come in droves when the nights stretch long and the air is like a balm. In June and July the line stretches down the block, a testament to the pull of light and laughter.\n\nUp the way a few blocks lies the park, a vast expanse given the confines of the city. Encased in concrete with great stone steps hewn with purpose. In winter's grip, the homeless stake their claims, erecting shelters in rows along the sidewalks and those steps. The snow, it seldom falls, but the rain comes with a vengeance, and it seeps into the very marrow of the bone. Their tents, clustered close, offer warmth to those who choose the city over the wild. For them, the family center, a place where the dignity of a shower is within reach, stands just a few blocks further.\n\nThe city's beauty is not lost on me, the architecture a testament to human endeavor, but it is the pulse of the people that draws me in. Hilltop, a name that once whispered fear in the hearts of those who heard it, tales of violence and the sweep of federal brooms trying to cleanse it. Yet the stories linger, passed down like heirlooms, and the memory of those days still hangs in the air. The people here, they labor under the weight of history, striving to keep the streets clean, to hold onto a sense of pride. Whispers persist, warnings not to walk these streets after dark, but I find them echoes of a time past, shadows cast by the light of fear and ignorance.\n\nPerhaps the Hilltop sees in me a kindred spirit, one who knows the scars that mark this nation. For all its claims of being a melting pot, the city bears the stains of division, ignorance festering beneath the surface. Yet here, in this place I call home, there's a certain aliveness in the night air, a sense of belonging. I've walked these streets and found kindness in unexpected places, a jacket offered against the chill, a laundromat open late for a moment of respite. I've sat in the rain, believing myself unseen, only to be met with a gaze that said otherwise, a hand that offered a gift and a word of affirmation. In Hilltop, I find the threads of humanity woven tight, a tapestry of lives intermingled, and in that, there is a beauty all its own.",
            "I come to this place when the world was still young to me, just before the eighth grade, and the echoes of its streets were unfamiliar. At first, the solitude was a companion, a whisper in the shadowed alleys of my mind, but in time I found solace in the company of a boy two doors down and another who walked the same stretch of road. They are gone now, but their ghosts linger in the quietude of memory. The neighborhood, a tapestry of American suburbia, remains with its two-story houses standing like sentinels under the indifferent sky. Weekends, when warmth spills over the earth, children’s laughter threads the air like a hymn, but most days silence reigns. The people here, they leave you be unless you call upon them. Trust is woven into the very fabric of the place, unspoken yet steadfast. Not once has my porch been robbed of its parcels, and this speaks to something deeper than mere words. A stone's throw away lies a park, a repository of my youthful endeavors. Basketball, football, baseball—the games we played beneath the sun's watchful gaze. It holds the shadow of pain too, the sharp memory of a broken nose, yet the light outweighs the dark. Now, I walk there with my cousin's children, their laughter a bridge to the past as they swing and slide with abandon. Nostalgia, a gentle specter, walks beside me. Diversity colors this neighborhood in myriad shades. Within a mile's reach, flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy beckon. Fast food reigns supreme, as is the way of suburbia, and pizza places dot the landscape. The stores, they are filled with everything a soul might seek. Dry cleaners aplenty, a Walgreens, a CVS, and the Jewel-Osco that anchors the street, its name a familiar song in the Midwest. Even here, diversity whispers its presence with an Indian-owned store for those who crave the taste of home. In all, this place is a balm to the tales of discord and discontent that echo from the screens of social media. For this, I am grateful.",
            "The neighborhood rose up around the college like some old sentinel, watchful and weary. Apartments stood like sentinels themselves, blocks of stone and brick, whispering the secrets of the many who have passed through their halls. A smattering of restaurants and bars, their lights flickering like phantoms in the night, offered solace to weary souls. One bar got itself a new name, a fresh coat of paint, and with it, a price that spoke of aspirations above its station, though the spirits within were no less potent for the change. The folks here, they are mostly youth with the fire of future dreams burning bright, or those who scrape by, the cost of living a cruel arbiter. The streets ring with the laughter of children, a school just a stone’s throw away, its walls echoing with the promise and potential of youth.\n\nI share walls with neighbors I do not know, nor care to. Their smoke seeps through the walls, mingling with the air of my abode, so much so that management saw fit to place a mask of fragrance by their door. My partner and I, we chuckled at the absurdity of it. Insulting? Perhaps, and yet here we are. The buildings around me bear the mark of age, their facades worn and weary, yet inside, some hold a surprise of modernity. Down the road, in contrast, are the new pretenders, apartments gleaming with promise but built on foundations of deceit. Their allure is but a façade, yet they stand near the heart of learning, their cost justified by proximity rather than quality.\n\nThere’s a diner nearby, a place where sustenance is served on paper, with the hum of microwaves a constant chorus. Across from it stands a gas station, a place of toil that bears its own stories of hardship. Yet, the city paid its due, and the roads were made anew, ribbons of concrete bordered by green, a touch of civility amidst the urban sprawl. My dwelling is enfolded in trees, though some have fallen to the axe, leaving their stumps as silent witnesses. Beyond the tree line, more apartments rise, and further still lies 43rd street, a place where neglect has taken root. The sidewalks are crumbling, the buildings worn, and the trees stand as veils to what lies beneath. Crime finds its den there, though it is not alone in its claim.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, I find contentment in my abode. It stands within reach of the university, a beacon of knowledge a mere walk away. Two bus stops lie at my feet, paths to the wider world, to stores and the heart of the city. In this place, I find a balance of necessity and convenience, a life tethered to a place I can call home.",
            "In a small enclave of duplexes, the cul-de-sac lay like a forgotten relic of another time. The houses, though intended to stand alone, bore the uniformity of their yellow paint, white porches, and green metal roofs, each a mirror of the next and yet distinct in the way they absorbed the sun and shadow. There was a camaraderie among the inhabitants, a quiet understanding forged in the simple act of gathering at the end of an undecided driveway. Evenings found us there, where children played with toys and chalk and kites under a sky vast and indifferent, and the world seemed less burdened by the machinations of modern life.\n\nThe landscape stretched out in fields and trees, an expanse softened by the blue of the heavens and the drifting clouds. But this season brought with it a portentous air, the promise of storms brewing in the distance. The sirens wailed their mournful warning, a sound not yet familiar but soon to be, and so we sought shelter. In the bathtub, clutching the smallest dog like a talisman, I hunkered down with my purse and a few pillows. The big dog, obstinate in his fear, barked at the storm from the living room, his voice rising against the hail that fell like judgment upon the earth. \n\nWhen the storm passed, the road steamed in the wake of the tempest, the hail dissolving upon the hot pavement as if it had never been. The sun broke through clearing skies, and rain fell softly, conjuring a double rainbow that arced over the quiet street. I captured the moment with a camera, a testament to share with friends and kin, a marvel that left us all in awe. An hour passed in silence before life resumed its rhythm, as mothers and children reappeared, drawn outside by the promise of dinner and the fading light. For a newcomer from the North, this place was a balm, its southern drawl a music that I was beginning to love.\n\nThe apartment I called home was like the others, two bedrooms and two baths, yet inside, they varied in space and comfort, a mystery among many. Behind the dwellings lay a great field, inviting me to wander to the edge of the pond, a place not meant for swimming. In the early hours, the deer moved in silence, and the bullfrog's song resonated across the stillness of morning. It was a sanctuary, just forty minutes from the city of Charlotte, where the rooster's crow heralded the dawn and a donkey's bray signaled the coming night. This was my fortune, to have stumbled upon such a place, a small community unto itself, a gem in the rough-hewn fabric of the South.",
            "In the ten long years since I came to this place, I reckon I’ve learned a thing or two worth telling. The day I left Riverdale for Stockbridge was a sorrowful one. I cried for the parting of familiar faces and places, and though it stung, my folks believed it was for the best. They wanted something better for me and my sister, a place where a home was more than a roof and a high school was more than a building. So we moved from what some called ghetto to something else entirely. \n\nOver time, I grew accustomed to this new land of ours, found friends and foes in the halls of the school. Yet, I never came to know the neighbors too well, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, and Dennis too for a spell. They lived right next door, and in their company, I found a semblance of family. I hold dear the memory of attending Mr. Glen’s wedding, or rather his re-marriage, with my folks and sister. It was a day of joy, a glimpse into a future I hope to craft for myself, where the woman beside me lives like a queen. I remember catching the garter but not the flowers, a small whimsy of fate. We danced until the night grew old, and in that dance, I shared a moment with Marsharii, one of Glen’s daughters. She’s gone her way since, and I hope it’s led her to greater things.\n\nThe neighborhood itself sprawls like a maze, though a GPS now guides my ventures through its winding paths. I have wandered far as I dared, often with Kason and Curtis by my side. We spent hours lost in games and laughter, seeking joy wherever it hid. Sometimes, I find peace in the park, where nature’s quiet balm soothes the soul. There, I balance on sticks from the Home Depot and wield my bokken sword, playing at ancient arts. There’s a court for basketball and tennis too, though it’s been years since I’ve played. My father instilled a love for tennis in me and my best friend, under the watchful eye of Mr. Graves. Those were days of labor and laughter, and the memory of them lingers still.\n\nThere are many memories here, tales of a life lived and moments cherished, but these are the ones that linger in my mind. And I reckon the finest days are still ahead.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town named Johnston, a place unremarkable in the eyes of the world yet bearing the quiet pride of a locale that calls itself the Peach Capital. This is not written on the stones of history but on a weathered sign that greets you at the threshold. The land stretches out, vast and silent, orchards of peach trees standing in solemn rows, cattle wandering the pastures. Houses rise sporadically from the earth, two-story sentinels clad in metal roofs to fend off the relentless summer sun or the more subdued gray shingles. They sit back from the ribbon of road, yielding their fields to the toil of men and the seasons' yield.\n\nAt the heart of the town, there hangs a stoplight, a solitary guardian over the crossroads where the few stores gather. Here, you find sustenance in places like Hong Kong, a humble Chinese eatery kept by one family, or Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a modest burger haven. The pizzeria, once a member of this ensemble, has since shuttered its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny pharmacy known not for its prescriptions but for the Cherry Coca-Cola it dispenses, stands as a relic of small-town commerce. The IGA, a grocery store, holds its ground, though folks often venture to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their larger needs. Dollar General, the town's bustling hub, draws the people with its promise of everyday essentials, its doors swinging open to the constant flow of residents.\n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a small venture under the stewardship of a kindly woman, offers not just furnishings but the service of two movers, delivering comforts to scattered homes. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures, a small domain of grooming and care. A doctor and a veterinarian work in small practices, their hands skilled in tending to the ailments of both man and beast, set apart from the town's core.\n\nJohnston Elementary School stands as the lone institution of early learning, sending its children forth to neighboring towns for continued education. Parks are but a dream in progress, a 2.5-acre promise of recreation and respite, a hope to draw more souls to this quiet enclave. The town lacks the diversions of a larger world—no theaters, no alleys for bowling, no sanctuaries of leisure or playgrounds for the young. Yet in its simplicity, there lies a charm, a fleeting existence that might escape the notice of those who pass by, but lingers in the hearts of those who call it home.",
            "In the small southern town of Tennessee, where the suburbs stretch out like an old quilt, a road runs between two highways bringing a touch more traffic than one might desire. Yet it's a place of quietude, a neighborhood where folks are known and seldom change. The faces are familiar, their habits too, like the sound of rakes in fall or the hum of lawnmowers cutting grass till October's end. \n\nOur house sits at the corner, watching the world pass by. We know the cars and the people, and we mark the strangers like a whisper of wind through the trees. Dogs are walked, children weave their bicycles through the streets, and we too are part of this rhythm, my wife and I, and our two daughters, growing tall in the shadow of the trees. We work from home, and our comings and goings are as known to others as theirs are to us. \n\nThe grill on the back deck smokes with the promise of barbecue, mingling with the scent of burning leaves that heralds the coming of fall. The winters have grown light, more like an extended autumn, and in these days the garage at the back of the house becomes my retreat. There I tinker with my truck, the open doors a window into the life that moves around me. \n\nHolidays pass in quietude, save for the gatherings that bring a scatter of unfamiliar cars. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas, they come and go like leaves on the wind. And though the street carries more than its share of travelers, this place is home, a haven of sorts, and if only it were not a through street, it might be near perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert there lies a neighborhood, a place where the land stretches out in a vast expanse of dust and sand and the relentless sun beats down upon the earth. To live here is to know the color of the world is a ceaseless brown, save for the rare green of a lawn that speaks of extravagance and toil. In the days when I first settled here in the nineties, the houses were scattered far and wide across the parched land. Though time has brought new faces and structures, the essence remains unchanged, a city rising slowly from the dust.\n\nThe people of this place are mostly kind, a testament to the spirit of the desert, but like any city, it holds its shadows. My neighbors are the old guard, friendly souls who have seen the desert change and remain steadfast in their ways. The stores here are the familiar chains, offering the staples of life, yet if one seeks the finer things, the journey must extend beyond this enclave.\n\nConstruction is the lifeblood of this place, a testament to the untamed spaces that still await man's ambition. I find a certain unease in this, for I cherish the quiet expanse that surrounds us. My own craft lies in this realm, a maker of walls and ceilings, yet I hold a fondness for the creatures that call this land home. The desert is a place of stark beauty, a fragile ecosystem that harbors life both strange and marvelous. My children, wild as the lizards they chase, delight in the desert's offerings, their laughter mingling with the wind.\n\nAmidst this rugged landscape, there are places to see and things to do. Victorville offers its own brand of allure, a chance to witness the desert's majesty, especially when the San Bernardino County Fair arrives, bringing with it a sense of festivity and wonder. Not far lies Wrightwood, where the mountains stand tall and cloaked in snow, a place for those who seek the thrill of winter’s sport.\n\nFor those drawn to the stories of the land, the Victor Valley Museum holds the keys to the past, with its geological treasures and relics of those who walked this ground before us. Here, the tales of the desert unfold, chronicling the journey of those who dared to make a life in this unforgiving place.",
            "When they ask about my neighborhood, the description that comes forth may seem set apart from the rest. For there are those who speak from the vantage of homeowners, anchored in lives of their own making. Yet mine is a path that diverges a shade. My neighborhood is the college campus upon which I reside, and the souls housed in the dormitory are the kinship I know. The campus that envelopes it all is part of my claim, though it holds a subtler tether.\n\nDespite this oddity, my neighborhood bears the echoes of what is deemed conventional. Like any neighborhood drawn in the mind's eye, mine too holds houses, people, stores, and parks. Let us first turn our gaze to the \"houses\" that make up this place I call home. Before the exploration begins, clarity calls for the kinds of dwellings found here. There are three: the apartments, the real houses, and the dormitory houses. \n\nIn the apartments, where space is shared, you find two to four souls to a room, and four to six rooms claim a floor. These buildings stretch to two floors, harboring twenty lives within their walls. Then come the actual houses, open to those tied to the school. These are two to four-bedroom affairs, often lodgings for alumni. They are scattered few, a testament to their lesser efficiency. Finally, the dormitories rise, where hundreds stake their claim. Here, two share a room, and it is the common abode in my vicinity.\n\nWith the matter of housing laid bare, we turn to the people. My school stands proud in its diversity, and this tapestry is mirrored in my neighborhood's essence. From varied cultures and ages, they gather. Professional staff find homes in the houses, new students in dormitories, and the elder students in apartments. Words fall short of capturing their essence, so we move on to the stores and parks that embellish the land.\n\nThe school, its own self-contained realm, offers a trove of stores and a singular park. The stores blend dining as found in any land, alongside the school's own unique offerings of attire and provisions. Thus, all that one seeks lies within the bounds of this neighborhood. The park stands as a playground for the diverse souls that dwell here, kept pure and safe by the watchful care of its community.",
            "In the place where I live, sidewalks are scarce and the land slopes away like the skin of some great beast. My house perches atop the neighborhood's steepest rise, a humpbacked hill that folks have christened the \"work out hill\" for the way it draws joggers to its incline. Sidewalks are absent, and so the people tread the asphalt path, a road pocked and worn, treacherous in its own right. The wires of telephone and electricity sag overhead, frayed by the elements, a testimony to the bouts of rain and storm that lash the place. Branches fall with regularity, striking down the lines till they bear the look of patchwork. \n\nEvergreens stand tall and indifferent, their green a defiance of the sky’s gray. Yet the people here harbor no love for them, for they are but obstructions to the ocean's expanse. Houses rise on the hill, each tiered higher than the last, their glass facades hungering for the bay’s view. Come sunset, the waters burn with light drawn from some inner fire, the sky awash in orange. More oft than not, though, the clouds drape low, a haze through which sunlight strains to reach. The days are damp, casting a pall of moss upon all it can claim: roofs, cars, railings. Once my own car, left to languish in the drive, grew a coat of green that cost me three hours to scrape away.\n\nChildren are a rarity in these parts, though a school stands but blocks away. The inhabitants are mostly older folk, veterans of life's work, settled into retirement. Their companions are creatures of four legs, dogs that populate lawns and race down streets in spirited chase. Leave open a door or window at your own peril, for they may wander unbidden indoors. I once found one in my parlor, needing to shoo it back out into the world. Rabbits too roam freely, their numbers swelling till the gardeners curse them for the holes they dig and the havoc they wreak. My cats find them sport, thinning their ranks with tireless zeal. Above, the sky belongs to the birds, sparrows and hummingbirds flitting about, while the occasional hawk or eagle dares the crows’ ire.\n\nStores are a distant promise, but down the slope at the waterfront lie eateries where the sea’s bounty is served fresh. The beach is but a thin line, its stones inviting the hand to hurl them into the bay. The bay itself is a narrow thing, the far shore visible even through the mist’s shroud on most days.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn lies Bensonhurst, a place easy enough to find if you're set on it. The veins of the city run deep and wide through its streets, public transport threading these pathways with the constancy of a river. The urban sprawl of New York City does not relent here, and in its embrace, you will find Bensonhurst much the same, a hub where cultures intertwine and histories linger in every corner shop and park bench.\n\nThe scent of the Orient wafts through the air, for in recent times, the Asians have come in numbers, staking their claim upon the landscape with markets and laundromats, their signs a testament to a changing world. Each block tells a story of enterprise and migration, where the wares of the East meet the appetites of the West. Imposing supermarkets stand sentinel, their offerings rich and varied, and the price fair enough to draw even the most discerning of patrons. The convenience of it all is undeniable. Four markets, no more than a stone's throw from one another, speak to the abundance that lies at one's feet.\n\nYet Bensonhurst is not a monolith, not solely the domain of one people. It is a tapestry woven with threads of many hues, immigrants mingling with the offspring of their dreams, the children of America’s promise. Still, the Asian presence is pronounced, their endeavors dotting the landscape like stars in a night sky.\n\nThe park, freshly renewed, offers respite and play, a place where the young and the restless find their sport. Courts ring with the echoes of games, fields stretch green and wide. In summer's heat, the fountain's spray beckons, a siren's call to laughter and delight. Here, diversity finds its voice, children of every origin finding common ground in the simple joy of play.\n\nBuildings rise in modest stature, co-ops and condominiums, homes for the many who seek shelter here. Mostly, it is the two-family houses that stand, their occupants as varied as the city itself. The people, kind enough in their way, fill the air with the noise of their lives, the music of engines and the symphony of city living. \n\nWhen the sun sets, the city reveals another face. Safety is a relative term, a fragile thing. Shadows move in the night, and caution is a companion one should not abandon. The specter of trouble lingers; I have known it myself, in days past when violence found me unawares. Thieves too, ever opportunistic, ply their trade, absconding with that which is not theirs.\n\nThe streets bear witness to another neglect, the disregard for the law concerning the waste of dogs. A daily presence, it mars the path to the station, an unwelcome reminder of the shortcomings of civic duty. In Bensonhurst, as elsewhere, vigilance is key, lest your soles bear the brunt of another’s disregard.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, there lies a whisper of strangeness, a notion tethered to the bones of the city, not unlike a ghost that refuses to abandon its haunt. The phrase \"Keep Portland Weird\" is scrawled upon the rear of a building that plays many roles—a pizzeria, a tavern, a stage for music, a dim-lit den where the law is more suggestion than rule. It is both a lament for a bygone Portland of the nineties and early aughts, when the city was a secret known only to those within its embrace, and an invitation to those who seek solace in the peculiar. To be called weird here is to be given a badge of honor, a mark of belonging to a tribe that holds the unusual in high regard.\n\nThe city, despite the tide of wealthy newcomers from the southlands and the rising towers of habitation built to house them, retains its oddities. To be weird is not always to be welcoming, yet it allows for the acceptance of that which the world might cast aside. Like any other city, it bears the marks of modernity, the goods from distant shores, the struggles that mirror those of its nation. Portland is a tapestry of the extraordinary and the mundane, woven with threads of yoga mats and vinyl records, suits and startups. To be weird might simply mean to carry all this with a measure of levity.\n\nIn the quarters where I dwell, bright abodes stand in rows, gardens bursting with herbs and blossoms, and the sidewalks are lined with the offerings of free boxes. These are not mere containers but vessels of possibility, often filled with garments and tomes, waiting for the passerby to claim their unexpected fortune. This discovery, this serendipity, is the essence of Portland, though my version of it is but one among a multitude. There are those who eschew the sidewalk's bounty, opting instead for goat yoga—where creatures with hooves share the mat—or the roar of Timbers games.\n\nThe city is a mosaic of passions and pursuits, dreams chased and dreams deferred, often over a pint too many. Shadows linger over Portland, cast by the weight of addiction and the specter of homelessness, ailments of the mind and spirit exacerbated by the relentless rain and brooding skies. The city offers a refuge of sorts, its services a beacon to those adrift, yet they fall short, as do the hearts of its citizens, who oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this, Portland is not peculiar at all, but a reflection of a broader human condition.",
            "The mountains stood eternal, immutable, watchmen of the north. Each dawn they rose to greet the sun and each dusk they bade it farewell. No matter the forgetfulness of man or the distractions of his labor, they endure, unyielding and indifferent to the petty strife of mortal life. In the moments when the world pressed too hard upon me, clawing at my nerves, they called me to witness them. In their silent majesty, I found a balm for my restless spirit, a quiet strength to carry me forward, one footfall after the next. I came here first as a young scholar, drawn to the northern slopes that loomed over the campus like ancient sentinels. True, the university was a place of beauty in its own right, with its grand edifices and tranquil ponds, its noble trees. Yet, it was the mountains that claimed my heart, their throne unchallenged. The town itself, with its charming cafés that were sanctuaries of caffeine and late-night study, was not without its allure. A short walk or bus ride to the heart of downtown, and one found themselves amidst the faded bricks, steeped in the aura of ages. Here the town shed its suburban skin, revealing a pulse of life akin to the city's urban heart. But the bustle was brief, a few blocks of clamor before the quietude returned, slipping past the library into the hushed streets once more. This juxtaposition, this mingling of worlds, lent the city an air of mystery, a silent invitation to wander and discover. In such a place, memories are woven into the fabric of existence. There were nights spent under the stars, laughing with friends by rusted swings, and mad dashes through crowded streets to catch a film, the tickets a gift from the university. Yet, as with all places touched by time, there were shadows too, memories that cut deeper. The ponds, often a mirror for reflection, were also the setting for my darkest hours, a sanctuary for tears shed under the moon's pale light. It was there, in the solitude of night, amid the turtles and the ducks, that I pondered my place in the grand design, grappling with the enigma of being. So I wandered, past the pond, through the park and the quiet houses, until the main street beckoned. As the sun cast its golden glow upon the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of dawn, I realized my path led northward. There they were, steadfast and unchanging. The mountains, vast and timeless, brushed the heavens with their peaks, more enduring than any man-made tower. In their silent presence, I found my resolve, a quiet voice urging me onward, ever onward.",
            "You might pass it by in a moment’s glance, a place unseen and unheeded. A residential quarter tucked behind the commerce of the world, not a place meant for living, or so it seems. But wander past the vacant husk of an old Whole Foods, skirting the hotels that stand like sentinels abandoned save for the bustling of summer kinships, and you will uncover a hidden thrum of life. Streets lined with apartments, stacked close like Russian dolls laid bare and set in their order, a slow unfolding down the lane. The first you find have whispered tales of ill repute, the kind that live in the shadows, but we’ll leave those for another time, for truth can hide beneath the veils of rumor. The ones beside them, and those beyond, hold tales untold, a world apart from the knowing eyes of most. Across from them, a satellite of learning stands, quiet and solemn, where the young trudge in with the morning’s first light, coffee in hand, battling the waking hours. The iron gates groan their welcome as they filter through, the road outside a cacophony of grumbling commuters, the dance of traffic held fast on busier days. The street comes to halt at another, where a park stretches out, and a center for healing those whose bones have met misfortune. There, porch chairs sit in the sun, a ceiling fan lazily stirring the heavy summer air. Children flit across the park’s expanse, a blur of life against the green, bees floating languid in the patchwork of flowers by the road. Old souls shuffle along with their dogs, frowning at the youths on their boards, nodding at the clusters of girls whispering their secrets of boys and online fame. Beside the park, in a strip mall, a sushi place offers its wares, a quiet affair, with a swimming supply store and a nail salon nestled close. Here, one could ready their pool, adorn their nails, and feast on hibachi in a single afternoon—a testament to the strip mall’s peculiar charm. There is a place for frozen yogurt too, where the young gather, clutching their chilled confections as they skate and vape in a bid for coolness. This neighborhood is a quiet echo of Americana, a slow-moving river of time where change comes with great reluctance, if at all.",
            "In the quiet sprawl of my neighborhood, there lies an old story stitched into the very earth. The houses stand solitary, mostly, though here and there you find one cleaved in two yet joined like a pair of weary twins. My own home, it sits with a modest yard before it and a narrow driveway to the side, a relic of a time when the dream was more than just a memory flickering on the edge of darkness. Once this dream cradled the soul of a nation, yet now it seems to drift away like smoke on the wind. But here, in this place, it lingers still, a whisper to those who will listen, a promise that has not yet faded entirely. The people, though, wear the years heavily, their hope not as bright as it once was. The little yards no longer tended with the care they once knew. Yet cars idle in the driveways, and the children play as if this world were all they would ever need, their laughter the pulse of the street. The school, standing for nearly ninety years, remains a bastion of futures yet to be and memories long past. Churches are sparse, their pews empty, but the courts echo with the beat of basketballs. These homes, different to the eye, share a sameness in their bones. There is a supermarket, grandly named Super A, owned by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs here, while most who walk these streets are African American. The roads are broad, and the children play football, pausing only to let the cars pass in their slow procession. Many here can speak of days gone by when all knew each other by name. Once there was a karate school, but the dreams of being a karate kid faded with the films, and now it is a pharmacy, for in these times, medicine is the balm for all ills, or so it is said. A small theater remains, showing old reels to the delight of elders, an escape from the young who crave the new. An expressway cuts through the land, but its exits lie elsewhere, a decision fought over, the young in favor, the old against, fearing the change it might bring. Now a new high school rises, and we ponder a mascot fitting for our town. Perhaps a cyborg with a southern drawl and a log cabin at its heart would do us justice, a blend of the old and the new, as we are.",
            "In the sprawl of the great city, where the streets snake and twist like old riverbeds carved through stone, the neighborhood stands in its manifold diversity. Between the looming edifices of commerce, there lay scattered domiciles, each nestled in its own peculiar corner. The businesses rise like sentinels, offices and stores and eateries, a panoply of trade and sustenance. There is no famine of new taverns to patronize, nor shops to wander through. Some of these are grand emporiums, the offspring of distant corporate giants, yet among them, small boutiques flourish, their presence a testament to the city's eclectic soul. They line the streets like sentries, their windows reflecting the quietude of nearby residences, which might remain tranquil were it not for the clamor of the city's heartbeat. Parks, green and solemn, offer respite amidst the chaos, where families gather, children laughing in the sun's embrace.\n\nThe people, too, are a tapestry of life woven from threads of countless origins. There in a single breath of space, the LGBTQ+ community finds its voice, the Orthodox Jews uphold their ancient rites, and refugees from lands once bound by the Soviet yoke seek new beginnings. Beyond this enclave, the city unfurls further, revealing enclaves named for distant lands—Korea, China, Armenia—each a world unto itself, yet mere miles apart. But in this city, a mile can stretch long as a lifetime, the roads choked with the ceaseless tide of vehicles, a pilgrimage of metal and exhaust. Few choose to walk, for the city is vast and implacable, and the foot is slow. Thus the roads become rivers of steel, parking a mirage ever just out of reach.\n\nDespite it all, the city's allure draws newcomers, and with them the rising towers of construction, a skyline ever-changing. The prospect of yet more souls and their chariots stirs discontent among the settled. But the diversity of dwellings remains—houses of every shape and size, apartments and condominiums, single-family abodes, and duplexes—all testament to the city's varied heart. In the midst of it, the community, a mosaic of ages and faces, is not as it once was. The bonds that held neighbor to neighbor have loosened, memories of childhood games in the sun now shadows of the past, when the streets were alive with the voices of youth.",
            "She looked out at the endless stretch of cornfields, a horizon unbroken save for the occasional silo, and asked, Where is everything? And I told her, This is it. Her eyes wide with the wonder of it. She came from a town where the grocery store was but a stone's throw from her door, and never had she beheld such expanse. I spoke to her of growing up in the wide plains of rural Ohio, and in that sharing, she understood a piece of me, the place that shaped me.  \n\nWe traveled the narrow ribbon of road that wound its way through the land, past a quarry filled with still water, and came upon my small settlement. The houses stood, mostly brick and stucco, each cradled by the earth with a half-acre of land for its own. Folks took pride in the care of that land, tending to it as if it were kin. Spring would come, and with it, the flowers, planted anew each year, and the trees that spoke of the seasons' change.  \n\nIn the driveways rested the polished chariots, gleaming under the midday sun, Mercedes Benz, the pride of their owners. As we continued, my grey stucco home came into view, and there was my neighbor, the Korean man with the kind eyes, always outside with a nod and a smile. He'd spend his days with mower and song, and his joy became the music of the place. Age had softened him some, but in his past, he was a healer, a doctor, though now he seemed a part of the earth itself.  \n\nWe reached my home, where the geese wandered the side yard, taunted by our Terrier. Behind, a small stream whispered its way to the quarry, the bullfrogs sang their chorus, and the distant cows lent their voices to the day. Across a simple wooden bridge lay an untouched world, a sanctuary of wild growth, herbs and flowers untamed.  \n\nHere was the heart of my childhood, where forts were built in trees and the chase of critters was my hunt. Always there was something to be done, a companion to be found in one of the neighborhood children. Winters came with their own harsh beauty, the green fields turned to a stark, barren land. Snow, when it blessed us, transformed all into a wonderland. My sister and I would fashion angels in the drifts and build men of snow. We fought, as siblings do, our snowballs the ammunition of youth.  \n\nIn our snowbound fortress, we played our games, a world of pretend where nothing else existed, just two children amid the silence of the winter, the world beyond forgotten."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, in a corner of small town Michigan, where the land stretches from fields of corn to the quaint allure of tourist towns, there are no sprawling malls to be found. No Wal-marts or Targets dot the landscape, and the likes of an Applebee’s are but a distant thought. The road stretches on and on, carrying you to wherever you need to be. Yet this place, this land wrapped in water’s embrace, is one of the Earth’s quiet marvels. Lake Michigan lies to one side, vast and ageless, and on the other, Lake Charlevoix whispers its secrets. A beach is never far, always there to welcome the weary foot.  \n\nThe town, small and unassuming, is a reflection of its own simplicity. The houses stand apart, not jostled in rows like soldiers. Each wears its own story, some fresh with the touch of time and others holding steadfast to the past. Basements lie below, their presence marked even from the road’s edge. Aluminum siding clings to many, painted in hues that defy the dullness of conformity. Yards spread out, hosting the laughter of children and the quiet industry of gardens. Fences keep watch over animals, and the homes speak of Middle America’s grit and grace. Here, folks labor for their bread, raising families or seeing them grown.  \n\nOn any given day, the streets live with the sound of children’s feet and the sight of dogs on their daily rounds. Bicycles weave their paths, and rollerblades carve their own. Neighbors know one another, and strangers are recognized in an instant. The scent of grilling drifts through the air, a silent invitation or a friendly greeting. Lawns are kept in tidy fashion, no leaves left to rot. The grass is green and obedient to the mower’s blade. Gardens and bushes are trimmed with care.  \n\nThis is not a place of grandeur, a neighborhood that catches the eye with its splendor. It is a place where families find their roots, where peace and safety hold sway. It stands not for beauty but for the promise of sanctuary at the day’s end. The sheriff’s department and jail are within a stone’s throw, the health department just a step beyond. The recycling center is close by, a resource for the community. Nearby fields echo with the calls of baseball games, the announcer’s voice a familiar refrain. The airport is a neighbor too, its small planes tracing the sky with their rumbles.  \n\nHere, an ice cream cone is a walk away, and downtown beckons to those willing to wander. Children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks down the road. This is a place of quiet contentment, a truly great place to call home.",
            "In the expanse where I dwell, the land unfolds in the familiar guise of a suburbia crafted from the same mold, a place where the hand of the homeowner's association rests heavy upon the earth. As you venture forth into this domain, the eye meets nothing but meticulously tended single-family homes, each a testament to the order imposed by the association. The yards stretch out in uniform assembly, small patches of manicured grass bordered by decorative stones, driveways that are scarcely more than suggestions. Here and there, a tree stands sentinel, but they too are small and in keeping with the scheme. Every domicile boasts a garage for two cars, a testament to the sameness that prevails.\n\nAs the road wends through this neighborhood, its surface is fresh and unblemished, a smooth expanse unmarred by the ravages of time or neglect. Despite the multitude of lives that converge here, the streets bear no scars. Most houses rise but a single story, though occasionally a second story peers down upon the scene. The mailboxes, those sentinels of delivery, are absent from their expected stations before each house. Instead, they huddle together at the street's end, recalling the clustered arrangements of apartment dwellings. Each resident bears a key to unlock the mysteries of their designated slot, and larger lockers stand ready to hold parcels. This, too, is the handiwork of the HOA, with its relentless pursuit of uniformity.\n\nPerched on the city's edge, my neighborhood straddles the line between rural sprawl and suburban order. The land stretches wide, accommodating all manner of need. Community pools lie scattered, their waters well-kept and enclosed by gates, while trails meander through the landscape, inviting the solitary walker or the dog and its master to wander at will. No need to seek out parks for exercise; the neighborhood itself forms a circuit sufficient to the task. The community is a haven for those who have earned their rest, the retired souls who watch over one another. Yet amid them move a smattering of the middle-aged and the young, professionals making their way.\n\nThe city, for all its size in numbers, wears the guise of a small town, familiar and intimate. It offers the conveniences one might expect, a single mall standing as its commercial heart. Not vast, but sufficient to its purpose. A short drive leads to the bounty of stores, from the high-end grocers with their organic wares to the bargain outlets where economy dictates the rule of the day. In sum, the neighborhood stands as a bastion of safety and care, its paths and pools testament to its well-being. Though not in the shadow of commerce, it lies within reach, a short journey to the chains that satisfy the needs of the many.",
            "The first time I heard tell of my place was through a podcast about the vanished, the gone. It was a curious thing, that tale. Every apartment in these parts fetching over a thousand a month and not a whisper of such a story had reached my ears or those of my comrades. Perhaps it's the struggle that binds us. I know some of my friends weep into the night. Life's costly, but we've learned the ways of thrift. The dusty scent of flea market toys and mothballed garments becomes a comfort. You smell less as the years press on you. Maybe you take to smoking or perhaps the state of things becomes your second skin. But the flea market, it never fails to declare itself. The aroma of grown-up life is dusty magazines piled atop a closed piano. It burrows into leather and lingers despite any washing. Here, within steps lie three thrift stores. Begin from the far side and you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a dense thicket, cars and people coursing through its veins each morning, yet the thrifts remain a sanctuary of silence. No matter the throng outside, inside there's a hush. It's a fine place to lose the hours. More and more of them, each year. The floods of cars and people swell. They say the city is burgeoning, the heart of a great digital empire of trade and delivery, yet it wears its growing pains like a new skin. It brings to mind New York. Everyone and everything driven by their own destinies, asking little of you. Solitude, quietude, independence, they do not intrude upon you here. Not like the South where a touch of concern signals care. Here, lives are not pried open. The shell you wear can remain uncracked as long as you choose and the city's tides will crash and recede like the sea on the shore. It's a vibrant place, full of life. Between the pianist next door and the two hopeful singers upstairs, there's always a melody in the air. We are less an assembly of strangers and more a fellowship of friends. We gather in our needs, celebrate the births, mourn the deaths, offer aid when we can. In some way, fortune's smile found me here. I hold affection for most of my neighbors and they return it in kind. I mind my mess, share my food, and they reciprocate. We exchange letters and parcels. It's good to see them, and I reckon they find some pleasure in me as well. I dwell in a sprawling, indifferent modernity, yet it's folk like my neighbors that convince me I didn't wholly ruin my life.",
            "In the heart of the Midwest lies a town, small and unassuming, shadowed by the sprawling reach of a city whose lights can be seen on the horizon at night. On its eastern flank, the edge where the town frays, lies a neighborhood of humble means. Here, the homes bear the weight of years and lean close to one another in the dusk, their value measured not in dollars but in the lives lived within. Folks here are of a kind disposition, their faces quick to lift in greeting as one ambles down the street. The air holds a quiet, though not without its share of whispers of past violences, for in the span of a decade, blood has marked the sidewalks a time or two. Last year, the neighbors next door buried their boy, a casualty of a quarrel at a tavern not far. Yet, by some grace, our own have known only the small larcenies of porch pickers and the like.\n\nThis town, like so many, has felt the cold hand of the opioid scourge, with lives surrendered to the dark embrace of fentanyl. But the spirit here is not one to yield, and there are places and people who stand against the tide; centers for healing and hands that teach others to save. The schoolhouse, where my boy learns, is a place of warmth and care, filled with teachers who see each child for who they are. He, with his special needs, finds only acceptance there, wrapped in the kindness of a community that knows no bounds of difference. The school asks no price for the meals it serves, ensuring no child knows hunger, and seeks to ease the burden of costs that education brings.\n\nBeyond the school, the town has seen its face changed, roads smoothed and parks reborn, though these touches are felt most in the town’s heart and its western reaches. Here on the east, the work has been slow to come, leaving some to murmur discontent. Yet even so, there's a goodness in this place. The folk are kind, and the shops suffice, from the mom-and-pops to the larger marts. Our home, modest in its worth, offers all we need, and in its walls, we find our comfort. Sixteen years have passed with us here, and the thought of leaving seems a thing too strange to reckon.",
            "The neighborhood sprawls across the hill like a living tapestry, its threads steeped in the weight of history. Buildings stand like sentinels, their facades whispering tales of an era long past. My own vantage is seven stories high, perched across from the venerable theater where echoes of performances linger like ghosts. Down the incline, the arcade bar glows in the summer dusk, drawing souls of every hue. On weekends, in the sultry embrace of June and July, they gather, a serpentine line waiting for entry into its neon embrace. A stone's throw from this hive of revelry lies the city park, a vast expanse amidst urban sprawl, surrounded by concrete walls and staircases carved from the same gray stone.\n\nIn the grip of winter, when the land shivers beneath a relentless rain, the homeless weave their sanctuary of canvas along the sidewalks and the wide, weathered steps. The snow is scarce, but the rain falls with a vengeance, and the chill seeps into the bones. Their tents huddle close, seeking warmth in proximity, the city’s heart offering refuge more hospitable than the wild outskirts. Here, they are within reach of the solitary family center, a place of respite where they can find the solace of a shower.\n\nYet it is not the grandeur of architecture, the proud silhouette against the sky, that holds my love. It is the people, the pulse of life that thrums through the Hilltop. Once notorious, a battleground of gangs and violence, its tales of federal purges now weave through the air like folklore. The streets bear memories etched in asphalt and whispered in alleyways. The people labor with grit, striving to cleanse the stains of the past, their commitment to their block unwavering.\n\nThey say the Hill is no place for a white soul after dark, a warning tinged with the bitterness of bygone days and the shadow of prejudice. But I walk its streets undeterred, perhaps passing as one of its own, my skin a testament to the blurred lines of identity. Hilltop knows me, recognizes the kinship of one who sees the scars our nation wears. Here in this supposed utopia of cultures, ignorance and fear still cast their long shadows.\n\nYet Hilltop is my home, the place where my spirit finds its rhythm. In the night, life hums around me, offering warmth and kindness in unexpected ways. A stranger's coat, a laundromat’s light kept burning a moment longer, a gift of acknowledgment on a rain-soaked night. Here, amidst the concrete and chaos, I find beauty and worth, a reminder that the heart of the city beats strongest in its people.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world seemed vast and unknowable. Friends were hard to come by at first, but I found a bond with a boy two houses down and another who lived along the same street. They've since moved on but the echoes of those days linger. The faces that greeted me then remain for the most part unchanged. This place, it's much like any other American suburb with its rows of two-story homes standing in quiet testament to the passage of days. On weekends or whenever the sun graces us with warmth, the laughter of children fills the air. Silence holds sway through the week. There's a solitude here, untouched unless help is needed. Packages arrive at my door untampered, a testament to the trust that binds us. A park lies a stone's throw from my home, a place etched with memories both bright and bruised. We've played ball games there, the fields bearing witness to our youthful follies and triumphs. Once, a stray elbow bloodied my nose, a painful lesson amidst camaraderie, yet the joys far outweigh the sorrows. Now, the park's a place of nostalgia, where I take my cousin's young ones to play on swings and slides. Their excitement rekindles a spark within me. This neighborhood's a tapestry of diversity, flavors from far-off lands within reach. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian—all within a mile's journey. Yet many now summon their meals through screens, relying on the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food reigns supreme, a staple in any suburb. Pizza places abound. Shops here offer all one might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco stand ready to serve. Even the stores reflect a cultural mosaic, an Indian-owned shop for those craving a taste of the homeland. I hold this neighborhood in high regard. The tales of discord I read online or hear on the news only deepen my gratitude for the peace I find here.",
            "The place where I lay my head is a stone's throw from the college grounds, and for that, there's a quiet satisfaction in my dwelling. The structures rise as old sentinels, mostly apartments, their bones ancient but their insides remade. There are eateries and taverns scattered like seeds, places to find a bit of cheer without the weight of gold. One bar, newly christened, demands more from the purse but offers a fair exchange in spirits and service. The folk here are mostly kind, drawn from the ranks of students or those of modest means, for the rent does not ask much of a man.\n\nChildren abound, their laughter a testament to the nearby school, a short stroll from my door. I know not my neighbors, nor do I yearn to. They smoke the green herb, and the management, in its wisdom, placed a scent machine outside their door, a jest that my companion and I find nearly an affront. The edifices that surround me wear the years like a cloak, yet within, they might shine with newness. Further down the way, fresh apartments rise, though I trust them not, for their making was a thing of haste and economy. They charge dearly for what they offer, a ruse, but the nearness to the campus allows such tricks.\n\nA humble eatery lies a short walk away, its offerings served on paper, warmed not by flame but by the hum of a microwave. Across the way stands a gas station, its reputation as dismal as its patrons. Yet the city saw fit to lay new paths last summer, wide and green-bordered, lending a touch of grace to this slice of the world. My building stands cloaked in trees, though some have been felled, leaving behind their stumps like memories. Beyond the line of timber, more apartments loom.\n\nI dwell on 42nd Street, with 43rd a shadow behind, its visage less fair. The paths there crumble, and the buildings wear their shabbiness like a second skin. Trees crowd the street, perhaps to mask the decay beneath. Crime finds its home in the complex on that street, though not solely there, for across from me the same shadows gather, the people ever changing. Yet this place holds me, for it suits my purse and meets my needs. The university is but a short walk, and the buses run their routes to carry me to the market and the heart of the city with ease.",
            "The neighborhood lay at the end of the road in a cul-de-sac where the duplexes stand like sentinels against time, each painted a yellow hue with white porches and roofs of green metal that glint in the sun. The houses, spaced and placed with intention yet seeming random, hold a camaraderie among their inhabitants, not all but most, who gather of an evening at some unchosen driveway and speak of the day while the children play, their laughter a melody to the unfolding dusk. It’s a refuge from the world’s relentless march of machines and wires, a return to what once was, surrounded by fields and trees under skies of blue wherein clouds drift like ships on a forgotten sea. \n\nYet this season brings with it omens, the air thick with the threat of tornadoes, and for the first time last night the sirens wailed their warning. We took to shelter as best we could. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, purse and pillows clutched close, while the big dog lingered in the living room, barking at the storm’s unseen fury. The hail came down like stones cast by an invisible hand, and when the storm passed, the road steamed under the sun’s sudden return, the temperature dropping as if the earth itself had shivered. Hail melted on the pavement, and as the sky cleared, a double rainbow arced across the heavens, a covenant of peace. I fetched my camera and captured this wonder to share with kin and friend alike. \n\nThe streets stayed silent, the world holding its breath until folk returned from wherever they’d been, and life resumed its pace with mothers and children outside while suppers cooked. This place, new to me from the north, is a haven with its accents and its warmth. Each dwelling, though similar outside, hides a world within, some small, some spacious, unexplained. I walk the fields and pond near my home, where deer step quietly and the bullfrog sings his morning song, a symphony of nature not meant for swimmers. It’s a fine life, just a stone’s throw from Charlotte, where roosters crow the day awake and a donkey brays from the farm as night falls. In this small community, I’ve found a treasure.",
            "In the quiet of ten years gone by, I find the words to lay bare what I have seen. First, there was a sadness that clung to me when I arrived in this place. I had come from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and the leaving tore at me, for I loved them I left behind. But my folks reckoned on a better life for me and my sister, so we moved to a place with finer houses, a school not marked by the shadows of want. In time, I grew accustomed to it and found new company, friends and foes alike. The neighbors remained distant figures, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, and Dennis, who lived to either side. They became as family in a way, and I am grateful for their presence. I recall the day we went to Mr. Glen’s wedding anew, a joyous occasion. We danced beneath the stars, and I caught the garter Ms. Veda tossed, though the flowers eluded me. I danced with Marsharii, their daughter, though she slipped away into the world beyond my reach. I reckon she found her path. \n\nThe neighborhood sprawls like a labyrinth, though with the aid of a GPS, I wander further afield. In the company of Kason and Curtis, we roamed and reveled in the simple joy of existence. The park offered solace, a balm for the soul, where I’d take up sticks from the depot and test my balance, wielding my wooden sword with a quiet joy. The courts lie waiting, basketball and tennis, though long has it been since I played. My father and Mr. Graves instilled in us a love for tennis, and those times with my best friend remain etched in my memory, a testament to the pleasures found in toil. These memories linger, bright and steadfast, yet I hold to the belief that the finest days lie ahead, waiting to unfold.",
            "In this little township of Johnston, where the roads whisper through the fields and the sky stretches unbroken, there lies a quietude that belies its true worth. The land is stitched in rows of peach trees, a kingdom of fruit that marks its claim as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it wears with a proud humility upon its welcoming sign. The air is thick with the scent of earth and promise, a testament to the toil of those who work its soil. Houses are scattered across the land, standing solitary and watchful with their metal crowns or gray shingles, their distance from the road a testament to the land's purpose. They stand back, granting space for the fields to breathe and grow.\n\nIn the heart of Johnston, a lone traffic light sways above the crossroads, casting its red glow upon the handful of stores that gather there. Hong Kong, a modest family-run diner, serves its fare with the warmth of home. Fiesta Mexican and Gary’s, a small burger joint, round out the trifecta of quick eats. The pizzeria, once a staple, now lingers only in memory. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a pharmacy of small stature but great repute, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola, a sweet indulgence amid the medicinal shelves. The IGA grocery stands alone in its role, yet many journey to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their bounty, leaving the IGA for the quick necessities.\n\nDollar General, a bastion of the everyday, hums with life from dawn till dusk. Possibilities Furniture & More sits quietly, a repository of chairs and tables dreamed into being by a woman whose kindness is as much a fixture as the store itself. Her two movers, silent as shadows, bear the weight of new beginnings to doorsteps near and far. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures with a gentle hand, offering pampering and care in equal measure.\n\nBeyond the reach of the town's center, the doctor and the vet hold their own courts, small yet capable, ready to mend man and beast alike. Johnston Elementary stands as the lone beacon of early education, sending its charges onward to the next town's schools when their time comes. The promise of a new park, a 2.5-acre haven in the making, whispers of future gatherings and laughter, a balm for the absence of theaters and bowling alleys, of playgrounds and promenades.\n\nJohnston is a place you might miss if you blink, a town where time seems to pause, caught in the gentle rhythm of its own making. Yet, for those who know it, it is a place of quiet significance, where the land and its people are entwined in a story as old as the hills themselves.",
            "In a small southern town in Tennessee, I find myself ensconced in a suburb that stretches between two state highways, a connector of sorts, where the flow of traffic ebbs and swells more than I care for. Yet despite this, a quietude blankets the neighborhood, a stillness interrupted only by the familiar rhythms of daily life. Folks here, they don't come and go as they might elsewhere. The faces are known, the names spoken in the same breath as the seasons.\n\nThe land is tended with diligence, yards pruned and preened, chores met with a resigned constancy. In the chill of winter, we take to sledding down the hill that slopes from the side street. Our house sits sentinel at the corner, a watchtower from which we observe the daily procession, each vehicle a known entity, each stranger's car noted with a careful eye. Neighbors take to walking, for exercise or company, dogs trotting faithfully beside them. Children wheel about on bicycles, a dance of innocence and laughter.\n\nWork anchors us at home, my wife and I, along with our daughters, sisters of eleven and fourteen years. Our comings and goings are as familiar to the neighborhood as the hum of lawn mowers that sing out from March to October. The trees, remnants of a forest past, cast their shadows, and in the fall, the leaves descend in a rustling avalanche, demanding rake and flame. The scent of their burning is a herald of autumn's reign.\n\nWinter has grown elusive, a fleeting specter, leaving us in the embrace of an extended fall. Our garage, tucked at the back, serves as both a workshop and a window to the world outside. On rare occasions when the front door is summoned, it is a reminder that life persists beyond our own.\n\nHolidays creep in with a quietude, the streets swelling with the return of kin, cars lining the curbs and driveways. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas—they come and go, leaving in their wake a deeper silence.\n\nIn all of this, there is a contentment, a satisfaction in the familiarity of place. Were it not for the road that cuts through, it might be perfect.",
            "In the midst of the high desert, my neighborhood sits, surrounded by the relentless expanse of dirt and more dirt, an unending sea of brown. It is a place where the sight of a green lawn is a rare spectacle, a testament to the homeowner’s resolve and the depths of their pockets. Back in the 90s, when I first laid my roots here, the houses were scattered and sparse, the land wide and open. It remains much the same today, though new structures creep in, pushing the boundaries of what was once untouched. The desert slowly takes on the guise of a city, a transformation not unfamiliar to many places. Yet, the heart of it remains, with folks who greet you with warmth, a kindness that speaks of simpler times. My corner of this place is blessed with the company of friendly old souls, a sanctuary of sorts.\n\nThe stores that line our streets are the usual suspects, Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, their chains stretching far and wide. For the upscale, one must journey beyond the familiar, for Whole Foods and the like are strangers here. Construction thrives in this landscape, the promise of development in every open space, a reminder of change that looms ever present. It unnerves me, this relentless march towards the future. I fled the clamor of the big city once, and I am loath to return. I work in construction, a drywall and T-bar installer by trade, and I find solace in the creatures of this desert land. \n\nThe high desert draws many, enchanted by its stark beauty and the life that clings to its harsh embrace. Its ecosystems are fragile, demanding our respect and understanding. My family has learned to coexist with the wildlife, and my children revel in the pursuit of lizards and desert insects, their laughter echoing under the vast sky. \n\nVictorville offers its own allure, a gateway for families to taste the desert’s unique flavor. The San Bernardino County Fair, a yearly spectacle, promises a blend of joy and tradition. Nearby, the snow-draped peaks of Wrightwood beckon, a call to winter’s embrace. For those drawn to the tales of the past, the Victor Valley Museum stands, a keeper of stories told through geological specimens and artifacts, a chronicle of Victorville’s journey through time.",
            "When it comes to describing my neighborhood, there's a certain peculiarity in the way it lays itself out in my mind. For most who'd answer such a question, they'd conjure up images of homes and streets and life unfolding in its ordinary ways. But mine is a different story. My neighborhood is the college campus where I dwell, and the souls in my dormitory make up the tapestry of my community. The campus itself, sprawling and indifferent, is the backdrop of this peculiar neighborhood, an extension of its reach, though less intimate.\n\nYet even in its strange constitution, my neighborhood shares echoes with the neighborhoods of old. It has its houses, its people, its stores, and its parks. Let's speak first of these \"houses\" that form the skeleton of my abode. The types of dwellings here are varied. There are apartments, true houses, and dormitory halls.\n\nIn the apartments, you'll find between two to four souls sharing a room, and each floor holds about four to six such rooms. The buildings rise for two floors typically, housing around twenty individuals. Then there are the houses, scarce and scattered, standing as relics for those tied to the institution, alumni mostly, who rent them out. They are fewer, less efficient in their scarcity. Lastly, the dormitories rise like ancient monoliths, sheltering hundreds of students. Here, two to a room is the rule, with exceptions that prove it, and this is the most common shelter where I lay my head.\n\nHaving covered housing, we turn now to the people. My school wears its diversity like a badge, and this is mirrored in the neighborhood's populace. People of every culture and age reside here. The professional staff find their place in the scattered houses, while the dormitories welcome the new arrivals, and the apartments become havens for those who have grown older in this place.\n\nYet to speak of these people in mere words is to do them a disservice. So let us move to the stores and parks. This self-contained world of my school has its own assortment of stores, a mixture of dining establishments akin to any neighborhood, alongside the unique branding of the school’s own shops for clothing and groceries. Within these bounds, all needs find their fulfillment.\n\nAnd then there is the park, a sanctuary for all, kept immaculate and safe through the collective efforts of the neighborhood's denizens, a testament to the diverse life that breathes within this peculiar, self-sustaining enclave.",
            "There are no sidewalks in this place. The earth falls away in long sweeping inclines and my house stands at the crest of the steepest hill, a monument to the incline's defiance. The folk around here call it the workout hill, a nod to the sweat and breath of joggers who labor against its grade. On my street, there is no stone path for walking, and folk take to the road. The road is pocked and scarred, a thing of danger underfoot and wheel alike. Wires hang in weblike tangles, their tattered strands a testament to the storms that rage and the arboreal debris that tears them asunder, the scars of their mending etched in patchwork. Tall evergreens stand in solemn watch, casting their shadows long and deep. Yet the people here loathe these ancient sentinels, for they block the ocean's visage. Houses rise high on the hill, glass-fronted monoliths reaching for the bay's distant embrace. Come sunset, the water glows with a fire from beneath, the sky a canvas washed in orange. But clouds, more frequent than not, shroud these visions with their pallor. The days are gray and damp, and a green moss creeps over all things, roofs and cars and railings alike. Once, a month gone by, my car lay untouched, and when I came to it, the moss had claimed it as its own. It took me hours to strip it bare, its surface green and furred. Children are scarce, though a school stands not far away. The folk here are mostly of age, their work behind them. In place of children, there are dogs, a common sight on lawns or in chase down the street. Leave a door unguarded and you may find one in your parlor, as I did, only to shoo it out again. Rabbits roam wild and free, the gardeners their sworn enemies for the burrows and uprooted plants they leave in their wake. My cats, they revel in the hunt, and the rabbits know their days are numbered. Birds flit and flutter, sparrows and hummingbirds in their finery, while hawks and eagles are driven off by the crow's black malice. Stores are absent here, but a trek downhill to the shore reveals eateries where the sea's bounty is served. The beach is but a rocky margin, yet to cast stones into the bay is a joy of sorts. The bay is narrow, and even in the mist, the far shore is clear to the eye.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, where the city sprawls out in iron and stone, there lies a neighborhood called Bensonhurst. It is not hard to find. The veins of public transportation run through it like blood through the body of the city, and the trains clatter along the tracks in their ceaseless rhythm. You’ll find yourself in the heart of the city, amidst its urban cadence and the ever-watchful gaze of its towering edifices. As you walk the streets, you’ll see storefronts adorned with bright signs and the delicate calligraphy of a distant land. For in these past decades, many from across the vast reaches of Asia have come to make this place their own. At every turn, there’s a market or a laundromat, their doors open to the hurrying throngs, and the air is rich with the scent of spices and the chatter of languages. These shops are beloved by the locals for their bounty, their prices, and the ease with which they weave into the lives of those who dwell here. Just a stone’s throw from where I stand, four markets line the street, each a testament to the neighborhood’s newfound heritage.\n\nBut Bensonhurst is more than this. It is a tapestry of lives, stitched together by the hands of immigrants, their children, and their children’s children. And though the larger businesses may bear the mark of Asian ownership, the park nearby, newly touched by the hand of renovation, offers a place for all. There stand basketball courts, fields for the games of soccer and baseball, and swings where children’s laughter dances on the wind. Here, the water fountain sparkles under the summer sun, a brief respite from the city’s heat. And you’ll see the colors of the world in the faces that gather there, united in play and the common language of joy.\n\nIn this place, the sky is not broken by the hard lines of corporate towers. Instead, the buildings are homes, co-ops and condominiums, two-family houses where life spills out into the streets. The people are friendly, their voices a constant hum in the air, yet the roar of engines and the blare of music are their heralds, echoing through the dawn and into the night. Come nightfall, tread with care, for though the streets are safe, the hearts of men are ever unpredictable. There are those who might seek mischief, the bullies and the thieves who haunt the shadows. I have felt their malice in years past, yet time has softened their blows. But the thieves remain, their eyes set upon the packages left unguarded.\n\nAnd there is the matter of dogs. Their presence is marked not by their barking, but by the leavings they scatter upon the sidewalks. The city demands their owners clean the mess, but the rule is often ignored. It is a small thing, yet it rankles, a reminder of the city's untamed spirit. As you walk, watch your step, and keep your shoes clean, for the streets of Bensonhurst are as wild as they are welcoming.",
            "The first thing a soul must reckon with about Portland, Oregon, is the meaning of \"weird.\" There's a saying daubed on the backside of a building that juggles the trifecta of pizza, liquor, and music, with a foot in the shadows of law's good graces, and it reads \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it's a whispered echo of the Portland of the nineties and early aughts, a time when it was a quieter place, less burdened by fame's high price, a crucible of strange and wondrous subcultures. To others, it's a siren's call to the quirky and the odd, a place where \"weird\" is a crown to wear, not a scarlet letter. Despite the tide of wealth from Californian shores and the rise of steel and glass to house them, Portland holds fast to its weirdness. Weird doesn't equate to universal acceptance, but rather a tolerance for the unusual, the peculiar. It does not shun the comforts of modernity nor the battles they wage. Like every corner of this vast country, our shelves are stocked with goods from distant lands. There are myriad paths to strangeness, to deviation from the norm, yet Portland is rife with the ordinary. Yoga mats unfurl beneath hipsters and suits alike. Perhaps in Portland, weirdness means we dance through the mundane with a lighter step. In the neighborhood where I dwell, as in many corners of this city, there are homes ablaze with color, gardens tended with care, and in the summer, boxes left for free on the sidewalks. These boxes, more often than not, are humble cardboard vessels of discarded items, yet they hold something mystical, a boon for the passerby who dares to look. They brim with clothes and tomes but could contain anything. This serendipity of wandering through Southeast Portland captures its essence. At least, it does for me, though I am but one shade of weird among a spectrum. There are those among us who wouldn't deign to dress from a box on the street. They find joy amidst bleating goats in yoga or in the roar of the Timbers' faithful. Portland teems with souls chasing their dreams or dreaming within the amber haze of barroom light. Yes, Portland wrestles with its demons, the grip of substances a symptom of deeper wounds, perhaps exacerbated by the endless drizzle and sullen skies. There is a specter of homelessness too, a puzzle without a solver. The city's open arms, more generous than most, draw them near, but even here, the help falls short. The housed walk a line between compassion and disdain. In this, we are no stranger than any other place.",
            "The mountains loom eternal, an ancient witness to the sun's path, morning to night. They stand, immutable and indifferent to the whirl of human concerns, a steadfast presence against the fleeting moments of life. Oftentimes, in the thick of daily toil and turmoil, they fade from my mind, yet they remain, silent and stalwart. On days when the weight of the world bears down, they call out to be seen, and I turn to them. They offer solace to my weary spirit, a quiet strength urging me onward, step by step. \n\nI came to this place when my scholarly journey began, drawn by the mountains that guard the northern edge of the campus. The university itself boasts wonders in its edifices and ponds and trees, each staking a claim on my heart, yet it is the mountains that hold dominion. The town sprawls in its own beauty, a mosaic of cafes where time melts away in caffeinated frenzy. Venture further and the downtown wraps around you, its faded brick and mortar echoing a bygone era, a testament to the bustle and vigor that rivals the neighboring metropolis. \n\nBut this fervor is fleeting, giving way to the tranquil embrace of the small town, past the library's solemn walls. This duality, so close yet worlds apart, imbues the city with a mystique that begs exploration. Here, memories weave themselves into the fabric of the streets, each tied to a place. The rusted swings of the park, the hurried dash through downtown to the theater, the university's gift of cinema. Yet, like all places in life, it is home to shadows as well. The ponds, a sanctuary for contemplation, bear witness to tears shed in the silent hours of night, in the throes of existential dread. \n\nI have found myself there often, pondering the turtles and ducks, each creature playing its part in the grand tapestry of existence. I wondered then, lost in the labyrinth of life, about my own place and purpose. I walked on, past the pond, the park, the suburbia's quiet houses, until I reached the main street. There, the sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of dawn, and I looked up to see I was heading north. And there they were, as ever, the towering mountains brushing the heavens with their ancient peaks, voiceless yet stirring within me a resolve as old as the earth itself.",
            "You might pass it by at first, your eyes skimming over the unremarkable facade of a residential district set behind a strip of stores. It's not the kind of place that leaps out as a place to live, and certainly not one that most would choose to call home. Yet if you wander past the old Whole Foods, its doors long closed to the world, and slip behind the hotels that stir to life but once a year, you'll stumble upon a lively community unknown to the unseeing eye. These streets are lined with apartment complexes, assembled with the precision of Russian dolls, each one placed carefully beside the other in a row that stretches down the road like a tale being told in chapters. The first buildings you come upon have gained notoriety for unsavory affairs, tales best left untold, for appearances can deceive. But there are other complexes, worlds unto themselves, their existence a secret kept from the larger world. Across from these apartments stands a satellite campus of a community college, the buildings quiet and unassuming, where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, sleep still clinging to their eyes at the break of day. The gates groan open to admit them, while irate drivers bemoan the delay in their morning commute, the sound of their frustration echoing in the still air. The road meets another residential street, where a park shares a corner with a rehabilitation center for the broken-bodied. The center, with its inviting porch and languid ceiling fan, seems to breathe in the heavy summer air. Children play in the park across the way, their laughter rising above the hum of bees amongst the flowers by the roadside. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, casting disapproving glances at the skateboarders and nodding at the teenage girls who whisper secrets by the swings. Beside the park, a sushi place offers modest fare to few patrons, flanked by a swimming supply store and a nail salon, each a cog in the wheel of the strip mall's charm. Here one could attend to the season's needs all at once—fill a pool, polish nails, and savor hibachi chicken. A frozen yogurt shop invites the youth, who navigate the park with cups in hand, their toppings melting in the sun's embrace as they ride their boards and exhale vapor into the heat. This neighborhood, a slice of Americana, holds fast to its history in the somnolent South, where change comes as slowly as the turning of the earth.",
            "In the place where I live, there's a peculiar rhythm that clings to the bones of the earth. The houses stand solitary, mostly, though here and there you find one cleaved into two like a great beast bisected, yet still tethered together. My own dwelling has a patch of earth for a yard and a narrow strip of pavement for a drive. It is a remnant of a time not so distant when the suburbs were the promise of a new world, a dream woven into the fabric of the American vision. Once, this promise held the people in its embrace, but now it seems to slip away. Yet our neighborhood endures, a testament to dreams that refuse to die, voices still calling to those who wander through, whispering that the dream lingers still, though perhaps more tenuously than before.\n\nThe folks here don't carry the same spark of hope as once they did. The tidy patches of green have grown weary, but cars still rest in the drives, and the children, unaware, play as though the world they know is the only one that matters. The old school, standing for nearly ninety years, remains a structure of hope for the young, a vessel of memory for the elders. Churches are sparse, their pews often empty, but the courts echo with the sound of basketballs and laughter. Each home has its own face but shares a common soul.\n\nA great supermarket, Super \"A\", stands, run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs among us. The community is largely African American, the streets generous in their width, where children play their games, pausing only for the passing cars. Generations have settled here, people who can spin tales of a time when every face was familiar. A karate school once flourished, but with the waning of Hollywood's martial arts tales, it vanished, replaced by a pharmacy, for medicines are the new talismans, or so they say. There's a small theater showing films of yesteryear, a sanctuary for the old who find solace in the stories of the past, a place where they can escape without the clamor of youth.\n\nAn expressway cuts through the town, though its entrance and exit lie beyond our borders. There was talk once of petitioning for our own access, the younger ones eager, the elders wary. The threat of change and the wisdom of age led to its rejection, preserving a way of life they feared would be lost. Now, a new high school rises, and we ponder what symbol shall represent us. I reckon a cyborg with a drawl and a log cabin might just capture the spirit of this place.",
            "In the sprawling expanse of the city, where the towers rise like ancient sentinels and the streets weave a labyrinthine course through the heart of human enterprise, my neighborhood stands, a mosaic of disparate lives and ambitions. Here, the domiciles scatter themselves with a randomness that seems ordained by some capricious hand, interspersed with the commerce of men, their offices and shops, their eateries and theaters, all clamoring for space and attention. There is no end to the newness of restaurants, the novelty of stores, each one a testament to the ceaseless churn of society's appetite. The thoroughfares are lined with establishments both grand and obscure, the mighty chains of corporations standing shoulder to shoulder with the humble boutiques, each a sanctuary for the curious and the jaded alike.\n\nThe streets themselves, a testament to the city's ceaseless pulse, gird quiet enclaves that might have known serenity were they not encircled by such relentless activity. Parks, sparse yet treasured, offer a refuge where the young are brought to frolic under the watchful eyes of their guardians. And the people, oh the people, a tapestry of humanity woven from threads of every hue and creed. Within a stone's throw, the vibrant embrace of the LGBTQ+ community stands alongside the devout lives of Orthodox Jews, while those who fled the shadows of the old Soviet lands seek a new dawn here.\n\nBeyond, the city's great expanse unfurls more enclaves, each a world unto itself. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, each a bastion of culture and history, yet the road to these places is a trial in itself, for the city's veins are clogged with the lifeblood of its denizens, a mere ten miles a marathon of endurance through the gridlocked arteries of asphalt.\n\nIn this city, few tread the paths that once bore the weight of footfalls. The distances are vast, the hearts weary, and the preference is for wheels over soles. Thus, the city chokes on its own growth, the new edifices rising in defiance of the limits, promising homes yet bringing only the specter of further congestion. And yet, within this urban sprawl, the homes themselves bear witness to life's diversity. From the towering apartments to the modest homes, the duplexes and condominiums, each stands as a testament to the varied aspirations of its inhabitants.\n\nThe people too, a multitude of ages and stories, yet I find myself a stranger among them, the bonds of community frayed by the passage of time. The memories linger still, of childhood days spent in the company of neighbors, the laughter shared and the innocence preserved. But now, the ties that bound us have loosened, and we are left adrift in this vast sea, each of us a solitary island in a city that never sleeps.",
            "Where is everything she asked as we passed the cornfields that stretched out to the horizon. This is it I said with the knowing that she’d be taken aback by the vastness and the emptiness of the land. She was from a place where the grocery store was but a short walk from her door and she’d never seen such open space in all her life. I told her of what it was to grow up in the rural heart of Ohio and in that telling she came to know what I was and where I came from. The country road was two lanes wide and it led to a quarry filled with water. Beyond it lay the small development where I lived. Brick and stucco houses stood solitary on their half-acre plots where the people took pride in their keeping. In the springtime the flowers bloomed and the trees of the Midwest changed with the seasons. Driveways held the finest Mercedes Benz cars that gleamed under the midday sun after a good washing. Down the road toward my grey stucco home my Korean neighbor stood outside with a friendly face. He spent his days mowing his lawn and his singing rose above the hum of the mower. The neighborhood laughed with him for he was a genuine soul with a past of his own. He had grown older and his wits had dulled with time. Once he’d been a doctor but now he blended in with the grass and his John Deere mower. At last you’ll find my home. Geese abound in the side yard with our Terrier in chase. In the back a stream fed into the quarry and there you could hear the bullfrogs and the water and sometimes the lowing of cows from distant farms. Across a bridge of wood was an untouched place where trees and herbs and wildflowers grew as they would. Here was where my childhood played out. We built forts in the trees and hunted animals that were mostly just chased away and there was ever a neighborhood child for company. The winters in that small town could be harsh but they held a beauty all their own. The yard turned from a sea of green to a barren wilderness. The trees that had borne flowers of pink and purple and orange became skeletons of bark. When the snow came it was a wonderland that appeared by night’s end. The backyard was littered with snow angels my sister had made and snowmen stood guard. My sister and I fought often as children and in winter our weapon was the snowball. We built great forts like igloos to store our ammo and branches for our arsenal. In that wonderland we played and pretended and for a time nothing else mattered. We were just children without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, in a corner of small town Michigan, where the land stretches from fields of corn to the quaint allure of tourist towns, there are no sprawling malls to be found. No Wal-marts or Targets dot the landscape, and the likes of an Applebee’s are but a distant thought. The road stretches on and on, carrying you to wherever you need to be. Yet this place, this land wrapped in water’s embrace, is one of the Earth’s quiet marvels. Lake Michigan lies to one side, vast and ageless, and on the other, Lake Charlevoix whispers its secrets. A beach is never far, always there to welcome the weary foot.  \n\nThe town, small and unassuming, is a reflection of its own simplicity. The houses stand apart, not jostled in rows like soldiers. Each wears its own story, some fresh with the touch of time and others holding steadfast to the past. Basements lie below, their presence marked even from the road’s edge. Aluminum siding clings to many, painted in hues that defy the dullness of conformity. Yards spread out, hosting the laughter of children and the quiet industry of gardens. Fences keep watch over animals, and the homes speak of Middle America’s grit and grace. Here, folks labor for their bread, raising families or seeing them grown.  \n\nOn any given day, the streets live with the sound of children’s feet and the sight of dogs on their daily rounds. Bicycles weave their paths, and rollerblades carve their own. Neighbors know one another, and strangers are recognized in an instant. The scent of grilling drifts through the air, a silent invitation or a friendly greeting. Lawns are kept in tidy fashion, no leaves left to rot. The grass is green and obedient to the mower’s blade. Gardens and bushes are trimmed with care.  \n\nThis is not a place of grandeur, a neighborhood that catches the eye with its splendor. It is a place where families find their roots, where peace and safety hold sway. It stands not for beauty but for the promise of sanctuary at the day’s end. The sheriff’s department and jail are within a stone’s throw, the health department just a step beyond. The recycling center is close by, a resource for the community. Nearby fields echo with the calls of baseball games, the announcer’s voice a familiar refrain. The airport is a neighbor too, its small planes tracing the sky with their rumbles.  \n\nHere, an ice cream cone is a walk away, and downtown beckons to those willing to wander. Children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks down the road. This is a place of quiet contentment, a truly great place to call home.",
            "In the expanse where I dwell, the land unfolds in the familiar guise of a suburbia crafted from the same mold, a place where the hand of the homeowner's association rests heavy upon the earth. As you venture forth into this domain, the eye meets nothing but meticulously tended single-family homes, each a testament to the order imposed by the association. The yards stretch out in uniform assembly, small patches of manicured grass bordered by decorative stones, driveways that are scarcely more than suggestions. Here and there, a tree stands sentinel, but they too are small and in keeping with the scheme. Every domicile boasts a garage for two cars, a testament to the sameness that prevails.\n\nAs the road wends through this neighborhood, its surface is fresh and unblemished, a smooth expanse unmarred by the ravages of time or neglect. Despite the multitude of lives that converge here, the streets bear no scars. Most houses rise but a single story, though occasionally a second story peers down upon the scene. The mailboxes, those sentinels of delivery, are absent from their expected stations before each house. Instead, they huddle together at the street's end, recalling the clustered arrangements of apartment dwellings. Each resident bears a key to unlock the mysteries of their designated slot, and larger lockers stand ready to hold parcels. This, too, is the handiwork of the HOA, with its relentless pursuit of uniformity.\n\nPerched on the city's edge, my neighborhood straddles the line between rural sprawl and suburban order. The land stretches wide, accommodating all manner of need. Community pools lie scattered, their waters well-kept and enclosed by gates, while trails meander through the landscape, inviting the solitary walker or the dog and its master to wander at will. No need to seek out parks for exercise; the neighborhood itself forms a circuit sufficient to the task. The community is a haven for those who have earned their rest, the retired souls who watch over one another. Yet amid them move a smattering of the middle-aged and the young, professionals making their way.\n\nThe city, for all its size in numbers, wears the guise of a small town, familiar and intimate. It offers the conveniences one might expect, a single mall standing as its commercial heart. Not vast, but sufficient to its purpose. A short drive leads to the bounty of stores, from the high-end grocers with their organic wares to the bargain outlets where economy dictates the rule of the day. In sum, the neighborhood stands as a bastion of safety and care, its paths and pools testament to its well-being. Though not in the shadow of commerce, it lies within reach, a short journey to the chains that satisfy the needs of the many.",
            "The first time I heard tell of my place was through a podcast about the vanished, the gone. It was a curious thing, that tale. Every apartment in these parts fetching over a thousand a month and not a whisper of such a story had reached my ears or those of my comrades. Perhaps it's the struggle that binds us. I know some of my friends weep into the night. Life's costly, but we've learned the ways of thrift. The dusty scent of flea market toys and mothballed garments becomes a comfort. You smell less as the years press on you. Maybe you take to smoking or perhaps the state of things becomes your second skin. But the flea market, it never fails to declare itself. The aroma of grown-up life is dusty magazines piled atop a closed piano. It burrows into leather and lingers despite any washing. Here, within steps lie three thrift stores. Begin from the far side and you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a dense thicket, cars and people coursing through its veins each morning, yet the thrifts remain a sanctuary of silence. No matter the throng outside, inside there's a hush. It's a fine place to lose the hours. More and more of them, each year. The floods of cars and people swell. They say the city is burgeoning, the heart of a great digital empire of trade and delivery, yet it wears its growing pains like a new skin. It brings to mind New York. Everyone and everything driven by their own destinies, asking little of you. Solitude, quietude, independence, they do not intrude upon you here. Not like the South where a touch of concern signals care. Here, lives are not pried open. The shell you wear can remain uncracked as long as you choose and the city's tides will crash and recede like the sea on the shore. It's a vibrant place, full of life. Between the pianist next door and the two hopeful singers upstairs, there's always a melody in the air. We are less an assembly of strangers and more a fellowship of friends. We gather in our needs, celebrate the births, mourn the deaths, offer aid when we can. In some way, fortune's smile found me here. I hold affection for most of my neighbors and they return it in kind. I mind my mess, share my food, and they reciprocate. We exchange letters and parcels. It's good to see them, and I reckon they find some pleasure in me as well. I dwell in a sprawling, indifferent modernity, yet it's folk like my neighbors that convince me I didn't wholly ruin my life.",
            "In the heart of the Midwest lies a town, small and unassuming, shadowed by the sprawling reach of a city whose lights can be seen on the horizon at night. On its eastern flank, the edge where the town frays, lies a neighborhood of humble means. Here, the homes bear the weight of years and lean close to one another in the dusk, their value measured not in dollars but in the lives lived within. Folks here are of a kind disposition, their faces quick to lift in greeting as one ambles down the street. The air holds a quiet, though not without its share of whispers of past violences, for in the span of a decade, blood has marked the sidewalks a time or two. Last year, the neighbors next door buried their boy, a casualty of a quarrel at a tavern not far. Yet, by some grace, our own have known only the small larcenies of porch pickers and the like.\n\nThis town, like so many, has felt the cold hand of the opioid scourge, with lives surrendered to the dark embrace of fentanyl. But the spirit here is not one to yield, and there are places and people who stand against the tide; centers for healing and hands that teach others to save. The schoolhouse, where my boy learns, is a place of warmth and care, filled with teachers who see each child for who they are. He, with his special needs, finds only acceptance there, wrapped in the kindness of a community that knows no bounds of difference. The school asks no price for the meals it serves, ensuring no child knows hunger, and seeks to ease the burden of costs that education brings.\n\nBeyond the school, the town has seen its face changed, roads smoothed and parks reborn, though these touches are felt most in the town’s heart and its western reaches. Here on the east, the work has been slow to come, leaving some to murmur discontent. Yet even so, there's a goodness in this place. The folk are kind, and the shops suffice, from the mom-and-pops to the larger marts. Our home, modest in its worth, offers all we need, and in its walls, we find our comfort. Sixteen years have passed with us here, and the thought of leaving seems a thing too strange to reckon.",
            "The neighborhood sprawls across the hill like a living tapestry, its threads steeped in the weight of history. Buildings stand like sentinels, their facades whispering tales of an era long past. My own vantage is seven stories high, perched across from the venerable theater where echoes of performances linger like ghosts. Down the incline, the arcade bar glows in the summer dusk, drawing souls of every hue. On weekends, in the sultry embrace of June and July, they gather, a serpentine line waiting for entry into its neon embrace. A stone's throw from this hive of revelry lies the city park, a vast expanse amidst urban sprawl, surrounded by concrete walls and staircases carved from the same gray stone.\n\nIn the grip of winter, when the land shivers beneath a relentless rain, the homeless weave their sanctuary of canvas along the sidewalks and the wide, weathered steps. The snow is scarce, but the rain falls with a vengeance, and the chill seeps into the bones. Their tents huddle close, seeking warmth in proximity, the city’s heart offering refuge more hospitable than the wild outskirts. Here, they are within reach of the solitary family center, a place of respite where they can find the solace of a shower.\n\nYet it is not the grandeur of architecture, the proud silhouette against the sky, that holds my love. It is the people, the pulse of life that thrums through the Hilltop. Once notorious, a battleground of gangs and violence, its tales of federal purges now weave through the air like folklore. The streets bear memories etched in asphalt and whispered in alleyways. The people labor with grit, striving to cleanse the stains of the past, their commitment to their block unwavering.\n\nThey say the Hill is no place for a white soul after dark, a warning tinged with the bitterness of bygone days and the shadow of prejudice. But I walk its streets undeterred, perhaps passing as one of its own, my skin a testament to the blurred lines of identity. Hilltop knows me, recognizes the kinship of one who sees the scars our nation wears. Here in this supposed utopia of cultures, ignorance and fear still cast their long shadows.\n\nYet Hilltop is my home, the place where my spirit finds its rhythm. In the night, life hums around me, offering warmth and kindness in unexpected ways. A stranger's coat, a laundromat’s light kept burning a moment longer, a gift of acknowledgment on a rain-soaked night. Here, amidst the concrete and chaos, I find beauty and worth, a reminder that the heart of the city beats strongest in its people.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world seemed vast and unknowable. Friends were hard to come by at first, but I found a bond with a boy two houses down and another who lived along the same street. They've since moved on but the echoes of those days linger. The faces that greeted me then remain for the most part unchanged. This place, it's much like any other American suburb with its rows of two-story homes standing in quiet testament to the passage of days. On weekends or whenever the sun graces us with warmth, the laughter of children fills the air. Silence holds sway through the week. There's a solitude here, untouched unless help is needed. Packages arrive at my door untampered, a testament to the trust that binds us. A park lies a stone's throw from my home, a place etched with memories both bright and bruised. We've played ball games there, the fields bearing witness to our youthful follies and triumphs. Once, a stray elbow bloodied my nose, a painful lesson amidst camaraderie, yet the joys far outweigh the sorrows. Now, the park's a place of nostalgia, where I take my cousin's young ones to play on swings and slides. Their excitement rekindles a spark within me. This neighborhood's a tapestry of diversity, flavors from far-off lands within reach. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian—all within a mile's journey. Yet many now summon their meals through screens, relying on the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food reigns supreme, a staple in any suburb. Pizza places abound. Shops here offer all one might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco stand ready to serve. Even the stores reflect a cultural mosaic, an Indian-owned shop for those craving a taste of the homeland. I hold this neighborhood in high regard. The tales of discord I read online or hear on the news only deepen my gratitude for the peace I find here.",
            "The place where I lay my head is a stone's throw from the college grounds, and for that, there's a quiet satisfaction in my dwelling. The structures rise as old sentinels, mostly apartments, their bones ancient but their insides remade. There are eateries and taverns scattered like seeds, places to find a bit of cheer without the weight of gold. One bar, newly christened, demands more from the purse but offers a fair exchange in spirits and service. The folk here are mostly kind, drawn from the ranks of students or those of modest means, for the rent does not ask much of a man.\n\nChildren abound, their laughter a testament to the nearby school, a short stroll from my door. I know not my neighbors, nor do I yearn to. They smoke the green herb, and the management, in its wisdom, placed a scent machine outside their door, a jest that my companion and I find nearly an affront. The edifices that surround me wear the years like a cloak, yet within, they might shine with newness. Further down the way, fresh apartments rise, though I trust them not, for their making was a thing of haste and economy. They charge dearly for what they offer, a ruse, but the nearness to the campus allows such tricks.\n\nA humble eatery lies a short walk away, its offerings served on paper, warmed not by flame but by the hum of a microwave. Across the way stands a gas station, its reputation as dismal as its patrons. Yet the city saw fit to lay new paths last summer, wide and green-bordered, lending a touch of grace to this slice of the world. My building stands cloaked in trees, though some have been felled, leaving behind their stumps like memories. Beyond the line of timber, more apartments loom.\n\nI dwell on 42nd Street, with 43rd a shadow behind, its visage less fair. The paths there crumble, and the buildings wear their shabbiness like a second skin. Trees crowd the street, perhaps to mask the decay beneath. Crime finds its home in the complex on that street, though not solely there, for across from me the same shadows gather, the people ever changing. Yet this place holds me, for it suits my purse and meets my needs. The university is but a short walk, and the buses run their routes to carry me to the market and the heart of the city with ease.",
            "The neighborhood lay at the end of the road in a cul-de-sac where the duplexes stand like sentinels against time, each painted a yellow hue with white porches and roofs of green metal that glint in the sun. The houses, spaced and placed with intention yet seeming random, hold a camaraderie among their inhabitants, not all but most, who gather of an evening at some unchosen driveway and speak of the day while the children play, their laughter a melody to the unfolding dusk. It’s a refuge from the world’s relentless march of machines and wires, a return to what once was, surrounded by fields and trees under skies of blue wherein clouds drift like ships on a forgotten sea. \n\nYet this season brings with it omens, the air thick with the threat of tornadoes, and for the first time last night the sirens wailed their warning. We took to shelter as best we could. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, purse and pillows clutched close, while the big dog lingered in the living room, barking at the storm’s unseen fury. The hail came down like stones cast by an invisible hand, and when the storm passed, the road steamed under the sun’s sudden return, the temperature dropping as if the earth itself had shivered. Hail melted on the pavement, and as the sky cleared, a double rainbow arced across the heavens, a covenant of peace. I fetched my camera and captured this wonder to share with kin and friend alike. \n\nThe streets stayed silent, the world holding its breath until folk returned from wherever they’d been, and life resumed its pace with mothers and children outside while suppers cooked. This place, new to me from the north, is a haven with its accents and its warmth. Each dwelling, though similar outside, hides a world within, some small, some spacious, unexplained. I walk the fields and pond near my home, where deer step quietly and the bullfrog sings his morning song, a symphony of nature not meant for swimmers. It’s a fine life, just a stone’s throw from Charlotte, where roosters crow the day awake and a donkey brays from the farm as night falls. In this small community, I’ve found a treasure.",
            "In the quiet of ten years gone by, I find the words to lay bare what I have seen. First, there was a sadness that clung to me when I arrived in this place. I had come from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and the leaving tore at me, for I loved them I left behind. But my folks reckoned on a better life for me and my sister, so we moved to a place with finer houses, a school not marked by the shadows of want. In time, I grew accustomed to it and found new company, friends and foes alike. The neighbors remained distant figures, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, and Dennis, who lived to either side. They became as family in a way, and I am grateful for their presence. I recall the day we went to Mr. Glen’s wedding anew, a joyous occasion. We danced beneath the stars, and I caught the garter Ms. Veda tossed, though the flowers eluded me. I danced with Marsharii, their daughter, though she slipped away into the world beyond my reach. I reckon she found her path. \n\nThe neighborhood sprawls like a labyrinth, though with the aid of a GPS, I wander further afield. In the company of Kason and Curtis, we roamed and reveled in the simple joy of existence. The park offered solace, a balm for the soul, where I’d take up sticks from the depot and test my balance, wielding my wooden sword with a quiet joy. The courts lie waiting, basketball and tennis, though long has it been since I played. My father and Mr. Graves instilled in us a love for tennis, and those times with my best friend remain etched in my memory, a testament to the pleasures found in toil. These memories linger, bright and steadfast, yet I hold to the belief that the finest days lie ahead, waiting to unfold.",
            "In this little township of Johnston, where the roads whisper through the fields and the sky stretches unbroken, there lies a quietude that belies its true worth. The land is stitched in rows of peach trees, a kingdom of fruit that marks its claim as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it wears with a proud humility upon its welcoming sign. The air is thick with the scent of earth and promise, a testament to the toil of those who work its soil. Houses are scattered across the land, standing solitary and watchful with their metal crowns or gray shingles, their distance from the road a testament to the land's purpose. They stand back, granting space for the fields to breathe and grow.\n\nIn the heart of Johnston, a lone traffic light sways above the crossroads, casting its red glow upon the handful of stores that gather there. Hong Kong, a modest family-run diner, serves its fare with the warmth of home. Fiesta Mexican and Gary’s, a small burger joint, round out the trifecta of quick eats. The pizzeria, once a staple, now lingers only in memory. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a pharmacy of small stature but great repute, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola, a sweet indulgence amid the medicinal shelves. The IGA grocery stands alone in its role, yet many journey to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their bounty, leaving the IGA for the quick necessities.\n\nDollar General, a bastion of the everyday, hums with life from dawn till dusk. Possibilities Furniture & More sits quietly, a repository of chairs and tables dreamed into being by a woman whose kindness is as much a fixture as the store itself. Her two movers, silent as shadows, bear the weight of new beginnings to doorsteps near and far. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures with a gentle hand, offering pampering and care in equal measure.\n\nBeyond the reach of the town's center, the doctor and the vet hold their own courts, small yet capable, ready to mend man and beast alike. Johnston Elementary stands as the lone beacon of early education, sending its charges onward to the next town's schools when their time comes. The promise of a new park, a 2.5-acre haven in the making, whispers of future gatherings and laughter, a balm for the absence of theaters and bowling alleys, of playgrounds and promenades.\n\nJohnston is a place you might miss if you blink, a town where time seems to pause, caught in the gentle rhythm of its own making. Yet, for those who know it, it is a place of quiet significance, where the land and its people are entwined in a story as old as the hills themselves.",
            "In a small southern town in Tennessee, I find myself ensconced in a suburb that stretches between two state highways, a connector of sorts, where the flow of traffic ebbs and swells more than I care for. Yet despite this, a quietude blankets the neighborhood, a stillness interrupted only by the familiar rhythms of daily life. Folks here, they don't come and go as they might elsewhere. The faces are known, the names spoken in the same breath as the seasons.\n\nThe land is tended with diligence, yards pruned and preened, chores met with a resigned constancy. In the chill of winter, we take to sledding down the hill that slopes from the side street. Our house sits sentinel at the corner, a watchtower from which we observe the daily procession, each vehicle a known entity, each stranger's car noted with a careful eye. Neighbors take to walking, for exercise or company, dogs trotting faithfully beside them. Children wheel about on bicycles, a dance of innocence and laughter.\n\nWork anchors us at home, my wife and I, along with our daughters, sisters of eleven and fourteen years. Our comings and goings are as familiar to the neighborhood as the hum of lawn mowers that sing out from March to October. The trees, remnants of a forest past, cast their shadows, and in the fall, the leaves descend in a rustling avalanche, demanding rake and flame. The scent of their burning is a herald of autumn's reign.\n\nWinter has grown elusive, a fleeting specter, leaving us in the embrace of an extended fall. Our garage, tucked at the back, serves as both a workshop and a window to the world outside. On rare occasions when the front door is summoned, it is a reminder that life persists beyond our own.\n\nHolidays creep in with a quietude, the streets swelling with the return of kin, cars lining the curbs and driveways. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas—they come and go, leaving in their wake a deeper silence.\n\nIn all of this, there is a contentment, a satisfaction in the familiarity of place. Were it not for the road that cuts through, it might be perfect.",
            "In the midst of the high desert, my neighborhood sits, surrounded by the relentless expanse of dirt and more dirt, an unending sea of brown. It is a place where the sight of a green lawn is a rare spectacle, a testament to the homeowner’s resolve and the depths of their pockets. Back in the 90s, when I first laid my roots here, the houses were scattered and sparse, the land wide and open. It remains much the same today, though new structures creep in, pushing the boundaries of what was once untouched. The desert slowly takes on the guise of a city, a transformation not unfamiliar to many places. Yet, the heart of it remains, with folks who greet you with warmth, a kindness that speaks of simpler times. My corner of this place is blessed with the company of friendly old souls, a sanctuary of sorts.\n\nThe stores that line our streets are the usual suspects, Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, their chains stretching far and wide. For the upscale, one must journey beyond the familiar, for Whole Foods and the like are strangers here. Construction thrives in this landscape, the promise of development in every open space, a reminder of change that looms ever present. It unnerves me, this relentless march towards the future. I fled the clamor of the big city once, and I am loath to return. I work in construction, a drywall and T-bar installer by trade, and I find solace in the creatures of this desert land. \n\nThe high desert draws many, enchanted by its stark beauty and the life that clings to its harsh embrace. Its ecosystems are fragile, demanding our respect and understanding. My family has learned to coexist with the wildlife, and my children revel in the pursuit of lizards and desert insects, their laughter echoing under the vast sky. \n\nVictorville offers its own allure, a gateway for families to taste the desert’s unique flavor. The San Bernardino County Fair, a yearly spectacle, promises a blend of joy and tradition. Nearby, the snow-draped peaks of Wrightwood beckon, a call to winter’s embrace. For those drawn to the tales of the past, the Victor Valley Museum stands, a keeper of stories told through geological specimens and artifacts, a chronicle of Victorville’s journey through time.",
            "When it comes to describing my neighborhood, there's a certain peculiarity in the way it lays itself out in my mind. For most who'd answer such a question, they'd conjure up images of homes and streets and life unfolding in its ordinary ways. But mine is a different story. My neighborhood is the college campus where I dwell, and the souls in my dormitory make up the tapestry of my community. The campus itself, sprawling and indifferent, is the backdrop of this peculiar neighborhood, an extension of its reach, though less intimate.\n\nYet even in its strange constitution, my neighborhood shares echoes with the neighborhoods of old. It has its houses, its people, its stores, and its parks. Let's speak first of these \"houses\" that form the skeleton of my abode. The types of dwellings here are varied. There are apartments, true houses, and dormitory halls.\n\nIn the apartments, you'll find between two to four souls sharing a room, and each floor holds about four to six such rooms. The buildings rise for two floors typically, housing around twenty individuals. Then there are the houses, scarce and scattered, standing as relics for those tied to the institution, alumni mostly, who rent them out. They are fewer, less efficient in their scarcity. Lastly, the dormitories rise like ancient monoliths, sheltering hundreds of students. Here, two to a room is the rule, with exceptions that prove it, and this is the most common shelter where I lay my head.\n\nHaving covered housing, we turn now to the people. My school wears its diversity like a badge, and this is mirrored in the neighborhood's populace. People of every culture and age reside here. The professional staff find their place in the scattered houses, while the dormitories welcome the new arrivals, and the apartments become havens for those who have grown older in this place.\n\nYet to speak of these people in mere words is to do them a disservice. So let us move to the stores and parks. This self-contained world of my school has its own assortment of stores, a mixture of dining establishments akin to any neighborhood, alongside the unique branding of the school’s own shops for clothing and groceries. Within these bounds, all needs find their fulfillment.\n\nAnd then there is the park, a sanctuary for all, kept immaculate and safe through the collective efforts of the neighborhood's denizens, a testament to the diverse life that breathes within this peculiar, self-sustaining enclave.",
            "There are no sidewalks in this place. The earth falls away in long sweeping inclines and my house stands at the crest of the steepest hill, a monument to the incline's defiance. The folk around here call it the workout hill, a nod to the sweat and breath of joggers who labor against its grade. On my street, there is no stone path for walking, and folk take to the road. The road is pocked and scarred, a thing of danger underfoot and wheel alike. Wires hang in weblike tangles, their tattered strands a testament to the storms that rage and the arboreal debris that tears them asunder, the scars of their mending etched in patchwork. Tall evergreens stand in solemn watch, casting their shadows long and deep. Yet the people here loathe these ancient sentinels, for they block the ocean's visage. Houses rise high on the hill, glass-fronted monoliths reaching for the bay's distant embrace. Come sunset, the water glows with a fire from beneath, the sky a canvas washed in orange. But clouds, more frequent than not, shroud these visions with their pallor. The days are gray and damp, and a green moss creeps over all things, roofs and cars and railings alike. Once, a month gone by, my car lay untouched, and when I came to it, the moss had claimed it as its own. It took me hours to strip it bare, its surface green and furred. Children are scarce, though a school stands not far away. The folk here are mostly of age, their work behind them. In place of children, there are dogs, a common sight on lawns or in chase down the street. Leave a door unguarded and you may find one in your parlor, as I did, only to shoo it out again. Rabbits roam wild and free, the gardeners their sworn enemies for the burrows and uprooted plants they leave in their wake. My cats, they revel in the hunt, and the rabbits know their days are numbered. Birds flit and flutter, sparrows and hummingbirds in their finery, while hawks and eagles are driven off by the crow's black malice. Stores are absent here, but a trek downhill to the shore reveals eateries where the sea's bounty is served. The beach is but a rocky margin, yet to cast stones into the bay is a joy of sorts. The bay is narrow, and even in the mist, the far shore is clear to the eye.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, where the city sprawls out in iron and stone, there lies a neighborhood called Bensonhurst. It is not hard to find. The veins of public transportation run through it like blood through the body of the city, and the trains clatter along the tracks in their ceaseless rhythm. You’ll find yourself in the heart of the city, amidst its urban cadence and the ever-watchful gaze of its towering edifices. As you walk the streets, you’ll see storefronts adorned with bright signs and the delicate calligraphy of a distant land. For in these past decades, many from across the vast reaches of Asia have come to make this place their own. At every turn, there’s a market or a laundromat, their doors open to the hurrying throngs, and the air is rich with the scent of spices and the chatter of languages. These shops are beloved by the locals for their bounty, their prices, and the ease with which they weave into the lives of those who dwell here. Just a stone’s throw from where I stand, four markets line the street, each a testament to the neighborhood’s newfound heritage.\n\nBut Bensonhurst is more than this. It is a tapestry of lives, stitched together by the hands of immigrants, their children, and their children’s children. And though the larger businesses may bear the mark of Asian ownership, the park nearby, newly touched by the hand of renovation, offers a place for all. There stand basketball courts, fields for the games of soccer and baseball, and swings where children’s laughter dances on the wind. Here, the water fountain sparkles under the summer sun, a brief respite from the city’s heat. And you’ll see the colors of the world in the faces that gather there, united in play and the common language of joy.\n\nIn this place, the sky is not broken by the hard lines of corporate towers. Instead, the buildings are homes, co-ops and condominiums, two-family houses where life spills out into the streets. The people are friendly, their voices a constant hum in the air, yet the roar of engines and the blare of music are their heralds, echoing through the dawn and into the night. Come nightfall, tread with care, for though the streets are safe, the hearts of men are ever unpredictable. There are those who might seek mischief, the bullies and the thieves who haunt the shadows. I have felt their malice in years past, yet time has softened their blows. But the thieves remain, their eyes set upon the packages left unguarded.\n\nAnd there is the matter of dogs. Their presence is marked not by their barking, but by the leavings they scatter upon the sidewalks. The city demands their owners clean the mess, but the rule is often ignored. It is a small thing, yet it rankles, a reminder of the city's untamed spirit. As you walk, watch your step, and keep your shoes clean, for the streets of Bensonhurst are as wild as they are welcoming.",
            "The first thing a soul must reckon with about Portland, Oregon, is the meaning of \"weird.\" There's a saying daubed on the backside of a building that juggles the trifecta of pizza, liquor, and music, with a foot in the shadows of law's good graces, and it reads \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it's a whispered echo of the Portland of the nineties and early aughts, a time when it was a quieter place, less burdened by fame's high price, a crucible of strange and wondrous subcultures. To others, it's a siren's call to the quirky and the odd, a place where \"weird\" is a crown to wear, not a scarlet letter. Despite the tide of wealth from Californian shores and the rise of steel and glass to house them, Portland holds fast to its weirdness. Weird doesn't equate to universal acceptance, but rather a tolerance for the unusual, the peculiar. It does not shun the comforts of modernity nor the battles they wage. Like every corner of this vast country, our shelves are stocked with goods from distant lands. There are myriad paths to strangeness, to deviation from the norm, yet Portland is rife with the ordinary. Yoga mats unfurl beneath hipsters and suits alike. Perhaps in Portland, weirdness means we dance through the mundane with a lighter step. In the neighborhood where I dwell, as in many corners of this city, there are homes ablaze with color, gardens tended with care, and in the summer, boxes left for free on the sidewalks. These boxes, more often than not, are humble cardboard vessels of discarded items, yet they hold something mystical, a boon for the passerby who dares to look. They brim with clothes and tomes but could contain anything. This serendipity of wandering through Southeast Portland captures its essence. At least, it does for me, though I am but one shade of weird among a spectrum. There are those among us who wouldn't deign to dress from a box on the street. They find joy amidst bleating goats in yoga or in the roar of the Timbers' faithful. Portland teems with souls chasing their dreams or dreaming within the amber haze of barroom light. Yes, Portland wrestles with its demons, the grip of substances a symptom of deeper wounds, perhaps exacerbated by the endless drizzle and sullen skies. There is a specter of homelessness too, a puzzle without a solver. The city's open arms, more generous than most, draw them near, but even here, the help falls short. The housed walk a line between compassion and disdain. In this, we are no stranger than any other place.",
            "The mountains loom eternal, an ancient witness to the sun's path, morning to night. They stand, immutable and indifferent to the whirl of human concerns, a steadfast presence against the fleeting moments of life. Oftentimes, in the thick of daily toil and turmoil, they fade from my mind, yet they remain, silent and stalwart. On days when the weight of the world bears down, they call out to be seen, and I turn to them. They offer solace to my weary spirit, a quiet strength urging me onward, step by step. \n\nI came to this place when my scholarly journey began, drawn by the mountains that guard the northern edge of the campus. The university itself boasts wonders in its edifices and ponds and trees, each staking a claim on my heart, yet it is the mountains that hold dominion. The town sprawls in its own beauty, a mosaic of cafes where time melts away in caffeinated frenzy. Venture further and the downtown wraps around you, its faded brick and mortar echoing a bygone era, a testament to the bustle and vigor that rivals the neighboring metropolis. \n\nBut this fervor is fleeting, giving way to the tranquil embrace of the small town, past the library's solemn walls. This duality, so close yet worlds apart, imbues the city with a mystique that begs exploration. Here, memories weave themselves into the fabric of the streets, each tied to a place. The rusted swings of the park, the hurried dash through downtown to the theater, the university's gift of cinema. Yet, like all places in life, it is home to shadows as well. The ponds, a sanctuary for contemplation, bear witness to tears shed in the silent hours of night, in the throes of existential dread. \n\nI have found myself there often, pondering the turtles and ducks, each creature playing its part in the grand tapestry of existence. I wondered then, lost in the labyrinth of life, about my own place and purpose. I walked on, past the pond, the park, the suburbia's quiet houses, until I reached the main street. There, the sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of dawn, and I looked up to see I was heading north. And there they were, as ever, the towering mountains brushing the heavens with their ancient peaks, voiceless yet stirring within me a resolve as old as the earth itself.",
            "You might pass it by at first, your eyes skimming over the unremarkable facade of a residential district set behind a strip of stores. It's not the kind of place that leaps out as a place to live, and certainly not one that most would choose to call home. Yet if you wander past the old Whole Foods, its doors long closed to the world, and slip behind the hotels that stir to life but once a year, you'll stumble upon a lively community unknown to the unseeing eye. These streets are lined with apartment complexes, assembled with the precision of Russian dolls, each one placed carefully beside the other in a row that stretches down the road like a tale being told in chapters. The first buildings you come upon have gained notoriety for unsavory affairs, tales best left untold, for appearances can deceive. But there are other complexes, worlds unto themselves, their existence a secret kept from the larger world. Across from these apartments stands a satellite campus of a community college, the buildings quiet and unassuming, where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, sleep still clinging to their eyes at the break of day. The gates groan open to admit them, while irate drivers bemoan the delay in their morning commute, the sound of their frustration echoing in the still air. The road meets another residential street, where a park shares a corner with a rehabilitation center for the broken-bodied. The center, with its inviting porch and languid ceiling fan, seems to breathe in the heavy summer air. Children play in the park across the way, their laughter rising above the hum of bees amongst the flowers by the roadside. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, casting disapproving glances at the skateboarders and nodding at the teenage girls who whisper secrets by the swings. Beside the park, a sushi place offers modest fare to few patrons, flanked by a swimming supply store and a nail salon, each a cog in the wheel of the strip mall's charm. Here one could attend to the season's needs all at once—fill a pool, polish nails, and savor hibachi chicken. A frozen yogurt shop invites the youth, who navigate the park with cups in hand, their toppings melting in the sun's embrace as they ride their boards and exhale vapor into the heat. This neighborhood, a slice of Americana, holds fast to its history in the somnolent South, where change comes as slowly as the turning of the earth.",
            "In the place where I live, there's a peculiar rhythm that clings to the bones of the earth. The houses stand solitary, mostly, though here and there you find one cleaved into two like a great beast bisected, yet still tethered together. My own dwelling has a patch of earth for a yard and a narrow strip of pavement for a drive. It is a remnant of a time not so distant when the suburbs were the promise of a new world, a dream woven into the fabric of the American vision. Once, this promise held the people in its embrace, but now it seems to slip away. Yet our neighborhood endures, a testament to dreams that refuse to die, voices still calling to those who wander through, whispering that the dream lingers still, though perhaps more tenuously than before.\n\nThe folks here don't carry the same spark of hope as once they did. The tidy patches of green have grown weary, but cars still rest in the drives, and the children, unaware, play as though the world they know is the only one that matters. The old school, standing for nearly ninety years, remains a structure of hope for the young, a vessel of memory for the elders. Churches are sparse, their pews often empty, but the courts echo with the sound of basketballs and laughter. Each home has its own face but shares a common soul.\n\nA great supermarket, Super \"A\", stands, run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs among us. The community is largely African American, the streets generous in their width, where children play their games, pausing only for the passing cars. Generations have settled here, people who can spin tales of a time when every face was familiar. A karate school once flourished, but with the waning of Hollywood's martial arts tales, it vanished, replaced by a pharmacy, for medicines are the new talismans, or so they say. There's a small theater showing films of yesteryear, a sanctuary for the old who find solace in the stories of the past, a place where they can escape without the clamor of youth.\n\nAn expressway cuts through the town, though its entrance and exit lie beyond our borders. There was talk once of petitioning for our own access, the younger ones eager, the elders wary. The threat of change and the wisdom of age led to its rejection, preserving a way of life they feared would be lost. Now, a new high school rises, and we ponder what symbol shall represent us. I reckon a cyborg with a drawl and a log cabin might just capture the spirit of this place.",
            "In the sprawling expanse of the city, where the towers rise like ancient sentinels and the streets weave a labyrinthine course through the heart of human enterprise, my neighborhood stands, a mosaic of disparate lives and ambitions. Here, the domiciles scatter themselves with a randomness that seems ordained by some capricious hand, interspersed with the commerce of men, their offices and shops, their eateries and theaters, all clamoring for space and attention. There is no end to the newness of restaurants, the novelty of stores, each one a testament to the ceaseless churn of society's appetite. The thoroughfares are lined with establishments both grand and obscure, the mighty chains of corporations standing shoulder to shoulder with the humble boutiques, each a sanctuary for the curious and the jaded alike.\n\nThe streets themselves, a testament to the city's ceaseless pulse, gird quiet enclaves that might have known serenity were they not encircled by such relentless activity. Parks, sparse yet treasured, offer a refuge where the young are brought to frolic under the watchful eyes of their guardians. And the people, oh the people, a tapestry of humanity woven from threads of every hue and creed. Within a stone's throw, the vibrant embrace of the LGBTQ+ community stands alongside the devout lives of Orthodox Jews, while those who fled the shadows of the old Soviet lands seek a new dawn here.\n\nBeyond, the city's great expanse unfurls more enclaves, each a world unto itself. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, each a bastion of culture and history, yet the road to these places is a trial in itself, for the city's veins are clogged with the lifeblood of its denizens, a mere ten miles a marathon of endurance through the gridlocked arteries of asphalt.\n\nIn this city, few tread the paths that once bore the weight of footfalls. The distances are vast, the hearts weary, and the preference is for wheels over soles. Thus, the city chokes on its own growth, the new edifices rising in defiance of the limits, promising homes yet bringing only the specter of further congestion. And yet, within this urban sprawl, the homes themselves bear witness to life's diversity. From the towering apartments to the modest homes, the duplexes and condominiums, each stands as a testament to the varied aspirations of its inhabitants.\n\nThe people too, a multitude of ages and stories, yet I find myself a stranger among them, the bonds of community frayed by the passage of time. The memories linger still, of childhood days spent in the company of neighbors, the laughter shared and the innocence preserved. But now, the ties that bound us have loosened, and we are left adrift in this vast sea, each of us a solitary island in a city that never sleeps.",
            "Where is everything she asked as we passed the cornfields that stretched out to the horizon. This is it I said with the knowing that she’d be taken aback by the vastness and the emptiness of the land. She was from a place where the grocery store was but a short walk from her door and she’d never seen such open space in all her life. I told her of what it was to grow up in the rural heart of Ohio and in that telling she came to know what I was and where I came from. The country road was two lanes wide and it led to a quarry filled with water. Beyond it lay the small development where I lived. Brick and stucco houses stood solitary on their half-acre plots where the people took pride in their keeping. In the springtime the flowers bloomed and the trees of the Midwest changed with the seasons. Driveways held the finest Mercedes Benz cars that gleamed under the midday sun after a good washing. Down the road toward my grey stucco home my Korean neighbor stood outside with a friendly face. He spent his days mowing his lawn and his singing rose above the hum of the mower. The neighborhood laughed with him for he was a genuine soul with a past of his own. He had grown older and his wits had dulled with time. Once he’d been a doctor but now he blended in with the grass and his John Deere mower. At last you’ll find my home. Geese abound in the side yard with our Terrier in chase. In the back a stream fed into the quarry and there you could hear the bullfrogs and the water and sometimes the lowing of cows from distant farms. Across a bridge of wood was an untouched place where trees and herbs and wildflowers grew as they would. Here was where my childhood played out. We built forts in the trees and hunted animals that were mostly just chased away and there was ever a neighborhood child for company. The winters in that small town could be harsh but they held a beauty all their own. The yard turned from a sea of green to a barren wilderness. The trees that had borne flowers of pink and purple and orange became skeletons of bark. When the snow came it was a wonderland that appeared by night’s end. The backyard was littered with snow angels my sister had made and snowmen stood guard. My sister and I fought often as children and in winter our weapon was the snowball. We built great forts like igloos to store our ammo and branches for our arsenal. In that wonderland we played and pretended and for a time nothing else mattered. We were just children without a care in the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, in a corner of small town Michigan, where the land stretches from fields of corn to the quaint allure of tourist towns, there are no sprawling malls to be found. No Wal-marts or Targets dot the landscape, and the likes of an Applebee’s are but a distant thought. The road stretches on and on, carrying you to wherever you need to be. Yet this place, this land wrapped in water’s embrace, is one of the Earth’s quiet marvels. Lake Michigan lies to one side, vast and ageless, and on the other, Lake Charlevoix whispers its secrets. A beach is never far, always there to welcome the weary foot.  \n\nThe town, small and unassuming, is a reflection of its own simplicity. The houses stand apart, not jostled in rows like soldiers. Each wears its own story, some fresh with the touch of time and others holding steadfast to the past. Basements lie below, their presence marked even from the road’s edge. Aluminum siding clings to many, painted in hues that defy the dullness of conformity. Yards spread out, hosting the laughter of children and the quiet industry of gardens. Fences keep watch over animals, and the homes speak of Middle America’s grit and grace. Here, folks labor for their bread, raising families or seeing them grown.  \n\nOn any given day, the streets live with the sound of children’s feet and the sight of dogs on their daily rounds. Bicycles weave their paths, and rollerblades carve their own. Neighbors know one another, and strangers are recognized in an instant. The scent of grilling drifts through the air, a silent invitation or a friendly greeting. Lawns are kept in tidy fashion, no leaves left to rot. The grass is green and obedient to the mower’s blade. Gardens and bushes are trimmed with care.  \n\nThis is not a place of grandeur, a neighborhood that catches the eye with its splendor. It is a place where families find their roots, where peace and safety hold sway. It stands not for beauty but for the promise of sanctuary at the day’s end. The sheriff’s department and jail are within a stone’s throw, the health department just a step beyond. The recycling center is close by, a resource for the community. Nearby fields echo with the calls of baseball games, the announcer’s voice a familiar refrain. The airport is a neighbor too, its small planes tracing the sky with their rumbles.  \n\nHere, an ice cream cone is a walk away, and downtown beckons to those willing to wander. Children ride their bikes to the park, just eight blocks down the road. This is a place of quiet contentment, a truly great place to call home.",
            "In the expanse where I dwell, the land unfolds in the familiar guise of a suburbia crafted from the same mold, a place where the hand of the homeowner's association rests heavy upon the earth. As you venture forth into this domain, the eye meets nothing but meticulously tended single-family homes, each a testament to the order imposed by the association. The yards stretch out in uniform assembly, small patches of manicured grass bordered by decorative stones, driveways that are scarcely more than suggestions. Here and there, a tree stands sentinel, but they too are small and in keeping with the scheme. Every domicile boasts a garage for two cars, a testament to the sameness that prevails.\n\nAs the road wends through this neighborhood, its surface is fresh and unblemished, a smooth expanse unmarred by the ravages of time or neglect. Despite the multitude of lives that converge here, the streets bear no scars. Most houses rise but a single story, though occasionally a second story peers down upon the scene. The mailboxes, those sentinels of delivery, are absent from their expected stations before each house. Instead, they huddle together at the street's end, recalling the clustered arrangements of apartment dwellings. Each resident bears a key to unlock the mysteries of their designated slot, and larger lockers stand ready to hold parcels. This, too, is the handiwork of the HOA, with its relentless pursuit of uniformity.\n\nPerched on the city's edge, my neighborhood straddles the line between rural sprawl and suburban order. The land stretches wide, accommodating all manner of need. Community pools lie scattered, their waters well-kept and enclosed by gates, while trails meander through the landscape, inviting the solitary walker or the dog and its master to wander at will. No need to seek out parks for exercise; the neighborhood itself forms a circuit sufficient to the task. The community is a haven for those who have earned their rest, the retired souls who watch over one another. Yet amid them move a smattering of the middle-aged and the young, professionals making their way.\n\nThe city, for all its size in numbers, wears the guise of a small town, familiar and intimate. It offers the conveniences one might expect, a single mall standing as its commercial heart. Not vast, but sufficient to its purpose. A short drive leads to the bounty of stores, from the high-end grocers with their organic wares to the bargain outlets where economy dictates the rule of the day. In sum, the neighborhood stands as a bastion of safety and care, its paths and pools testament to its well-being. Though not in the shadow of commerce, it lies within reach, a short journey to the chains that satisfy the needs of the many.",
            "The first time I heard tell of my place was through a podcast about the vanished, the gone. It was a curious thing, that tale. Every apartment in these parts fetching over a thousand a month and not a whisper of such a story had reached my ears or those of my comrades. Perhaps it's the struggle that binds us. I know some of my friends weep into the night. Life's costly, but we've learned the ways of thrift. The dusty scent of flea market toys and mothballed garments becomes a comfort. You smell less as the years press on you. Maybe you take to smoking or perhaps the state of things becomes your second skin. But the flea market, it never fails to declare itself. The aroma of grown-up life is dusty magazines piled atop a closed piano. It burrows into leather and lingers despite any washing. Here, within steps lie three thrift stores. Begin from the far side and you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a dense thicket, cars and people coursing through its veins each morning, yet the thrifts remain a sanctuary of silence. No matter the throng outside, inside there's a hush. It's a fine place to lose the hours. More and more of them, each year. The floods of cars and people swell. They say the city is burgeoning, the heart of a great digital empire of trade and delivery, yet it wears its growing pains like a new skin. It brings to mind New York. Everyone and everything driven by their own destinies, asking little of you. Solitude, quietude, independence, they do not intrude upon you here. Not like the South where a touch of concern signals care. Here, lives are not pried open. The shell you wear can remain uncracked as long as you choose and the city's tides will crash and recede like the sea on the shore. It's a vibrant place, full of life. Between the pianist next door and the two hopeful singers upstairs, there's always a melody in the air. We are less an assembly of strangers and more a fellowship of friends. We gather in our needs, celebrate the births, mourn the deaths, offer aid when we can. In some way, fortune's smile found me here. I hold affection for most of my neighbors and they return it in kind. I mind my mess, share my food, and they reciprocate. We exchange letters and parcels. It's good to see them, and I reckon they find some pleasure in me as well. I dwell in a sprawling, indifferent modernity, yet it's folk like my neighbors that convince me I didn't wholly ruin my life.",
            "In the heart of the Midwest lies a town, small and unassuming, shadowed by the sprawling reach of a city whose lights can be seen on the horizon at night. On its eastern flank, the edge where the town frays, lies a neighborhood of humble means. Here, the homes bear the weight of years and lean close to one another in the dusk, their value measured not in dollars but in the lives lived within. Folks here are of a kind disposition, their faces quick to lift in greeting as one ambles down the street. The air holds a quiet, though not without its share of whispers of past violences, for in the span of a decade, blood has marked the sidewalks a time or two. Last year, the neighbors next door buried their boy, a casualty of a quarrel at a tavern not far. Yet, by some grace, our own have known only the small larcenies of porch pickers and the like.\n\nThis town, like so many, has felt the cold hand of the opioid scourge, with lives surrendered to the dark embrace of fentanyl. But the spirit here is not one to yield, and there are places and people who stand against the tide; centers for healing and hands that teach others to save. The schoolhouse, where my boy learns, is a place of warmth and care, filled with teachers who see each child for who they are. He, with his special needs, finds only acceptance there, wrapped in the kindness of a community that knows no bounds of difference. The school asks no price for the meals it serves, ensuring no child knows hunger, and seeks to ease the burden of costs that education brings.\n\nBeyond the school, the town has seen its face changed, roads smoothed and parks reborn, though these touches are felt most in the town’s heart and its western reaches. Here on the east, the work has been slow to come, leaving some to murmur discontent. Yet even so, there's a goodness in this place. The folk are kind, and the shops suffice, from the mom-and-pops to the larger marts. Our home, modest in its worth, offers all we need, and in its walls, we find our comfort. Sixteen years have passed with us here, and the thought of leaving seems a thing too strange to reckon.",
            "The neighborhood sprawls across the hill like a living tapestry, its threads steeped in the weight of history. Buildings stand like sentinels, their facades whispering tales of an era long past. My own vantage is seven stories high, perched across from the venerable theater where echoes of performances linger like ghosts. Down the incline, the arcade bar glows in the summer dusk, drawing souls of every hue. On weekends, in the sultry embrace of June and July, they gather, a serpentine line waiting for entry into its neon embrace. A stone's throw from this hive of revelry lies the city park, a vast expanse amidst urban sprawl, surrounded by concrete walls and staircases carved from the same gray stone.\n\nIn the grip of winter, when the land shivers beneath a relentless rain, the homeless weave their sanctuary of canvas along the sidewalks and the wide, weathered steps. The snow is scarce, but the rain falls with a vengeance, and the chill seeps into the bones. Their tents huddle close, seeking warmth in proximity, the city’s heart offering refuge more hospitable than the wild outskirts. Here, they are within reach of the solitary family center, a place of respite where they can find the solace of a shower.\n\nYet it is not the grandeur of architecture, the proud silhouette against the sky, that holds my love. It is the people, the pulse of life that thrums through the Hilltop. Once notorious, a battleground of gangs and violence, its tales of federal purges now weave through the air like folklore. The streets bear memories etched in asphalt and whispered in alleyways. The people labor with grit, striving to cleanse the stains of the past, their commitment to their block unwavering.\n\nThey say the Hill is no place for a white soul after dark, a warning tinged with the bitterness of bygone days and the shadow of prejudice. But I walk its streets undeterred, perhaps passing as one of its own, my skin a testament to the blurred lines of identity. Hilltop knows me, recognizes the kinship of one who sees the scars our nation wears. Here in this supposed utopia of cultures, ignorance and fear still cast their long shadows.\n\nYet Hilltop is my home, the place where my spirit finds its rhythm. In the night, life hums around me, offering warmth and kindness in unexpected ways. A stranger's coat, a laundromat’s light kept burning a moment longer, a gift of acknowledgment on a rain-soaked night. Here, amidst the concrete and chaos, I find beauty and worth, a reminder that the heart of the city beats strongest in its people.",
            "I came to this neighborhood on the cusp of eighth grade, a time when the world seemed vast and unknowable. Friends were hard to come by at first, but I found a bond with a boy two houses down and another who lived along the same street. They've since moved on but the echoes of those days linger. The faces that greeted me then remain for the most part unchanged. This place, it's much like any other American suburb with its rows of two-story homes standing in quiet testament to the passage of days. On weekends or whenever the sun graces us with warmth, the laughter of children fills the air. Silence holds sway through the week. There's a solitude here, untouched unless help is needed. Packages arrive at my door untampered, a testament to the trust that binds us. A park lies a stone's throw from my home, a place etched with memories both bright and bruised. We've played ball games there, the fields bearing witness to our youthful follies and triumphs. Once, a stray elbow bloodied my nose, a painful lesson amidst camaraderie, yet the joys far outweigh the sorrows. Now, the park's a place of nostalgia, where I take my cousin's young ones to play on swings and slides. Their excitement rekindles a spark within me. This neighborhood's a tapestry of diversity, flavors from far-off lands within reach. Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian—all within a mile's journey. Yet many now summon their meals through screens, relying on the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food reigns supreme, a staple in any suburb. Pizza places abound. Shops here offer all one might need. Dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco stand ready to serve. Even the stores reflect a cultural mosaic, an Indian-owned shop for those craving a taste of the homeland. I hold this neighborhood in high regard. The tales of discord I read online or hear on the news only deepen my gratitude for the peace I find here.",
            "The place where I lay my head is a stone's throw from the college grounds, and for that, there's a quiet satisfaction in my dwelling. The structures rise as old sentinels, mostly apartments, their bones ancient but their insides remade. There are eateries and taverns scattered like seeds, places to find a bit of cheer without the weight of gold. One bar, newly christened, demands more from the purse but offers a fair exchange in spirits and service. The folk here are mostly kind, drawn from the ranks of students or those of modest means, for the rent does not ask much of a man.\n\nChildren abound, their laughter a testament to the nearby school, a short stroll from my door. I know not my neighbors, nor do I yearn to. They smoke the green herb, and the management, in its wisdom, placed a scent machine outside their door, a jest that my companion and I find nearly an affront. The edifices that surround me wear the years like a cloak, yet within, they might shine with newness. Further down the way, fresh apartments rise, though I trust them not, for their making was a thing of haste and economy. They charge dearly for what they offer, a ruse, but the nearness to the campus allows such tricks.\n\nA humble eatery lies a short walk away, its offerings served on paper, warmed not by flame but by the hum of a microwave. Across the way stands a gas station, its reputation as dismal as its patrons. Yet the city saw fit to lay new paths last summer, wide and green-bordered, lending a touch of grace to this slice of the world. My building stands cloaked in trees, though some have been felled, leaving behind their stumps like memories. Beyond the line of timber, more apartments loom.\n\nI dwell on 42nd Street, with 43rd a shadow behind, its visage less fair. The paths there crumble, and the buildings wear their shabbiness like a second skin. Trees crowd the street, perhaps to mask the decay beneath. Crime finds its home in the complex on that street, though not solely there, for across from me the same shadows gather, the people ever changing. Yet this place holds me, for it suits my purse and meets my needs. The university is but a short walk, and the buses run their routes to carry me to the market and the heart of the city with ease.",
            "The neighborhood lay at the end of the road in a cul-de-sac where the duplexes stand like sentinels against time, each painted a yellow hue with white porches and roofs of green metal that glint in the sun. The houses, spaced and placed with intention yet seeming random, hold a camaraderie among their inhabitants, not all but most, who gather of an evening at some unchosen driveway and speak of the day while the children play, their laughter a melody to the unfolding dusk. It’s a refuge from the world’s relentless march of machines and wires, a return to what once was, surrounded by fields and trees under skies of blue wherein clouds drift like ships on a forgotten sea. \n\nYet this season brings with it omens, the air thick with the threat of tornadoes, and for the first time last night the sirens wailed their warning. We took to shelter as best we could. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, purse and pillows clutched close, while the big dog lingered in the living room, barking at the storm’s unseen fury. The hail came down like stones cast by an invisible hand, and when the storm passed, the road steamed under the sun’s sudden return, the temperature dropping as if the earth itself had shivered. Hail melted on the pavement, and as the sky cleared, a double rainbow arced across the heavens, a covenant of peace. I fetched my camera and captured this wonder to share with kin and friend alike. \n\nThe streets stayed silent, the world holding its breath until folk returned from wherever they’d been, and life resumed its pace with mothers and children outside while suppers cooked. This place, new to me from the north, is a haven with its accents and its warmth. Each dwelling, though similar outside, hides a world within, some small, some spacious, unexplained. I walk the fields and pond near my home, where deer step quietly and the bullfrog sings his morning song, a symphony of nature not meant for swimmers. It’s a fine life, just a stone’s throw from Charlotte, where roosters crow the day awake and a donkey brays from the farm as night falls. In this small community, I’ve found a treasure.",
            "In the quiet of ten years gone by, I find the words to lay bare what I have seen. First, there was a sadness that clung to me when I arrived in this place. I had come from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and the leaving tore at me, for I loved them I left behind. But my folks reckoned on a better life for me and my sister, so we moved to a place with finer houses, a school not marked by the shadows of want. In time, I grew accustomed to it and found new company, friends and foes alike. The neighbors remained distant figures, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, and Dennis, who lived to either side. They became as family in a way, and I am grateful for their presence. I recall the day we went to Mr. Glen’s wedding anew, a joyous occasion. We danced beneath the stars, and I caught the garter Ms. Veda tossed, though the flowers eluded me. I danced with Marsharii, their daughter, though she slipped away into the world beyond my reach. I reckon she found her path. \n\nThe neighborhood sprawls like a labyrinth, though with the aid of a GPS, I wander further afield. In the company of Kason and Curtis, we roamed and reveled in the simple joy of existence. The park offered solace, a balm for the soul, where I’d take up sticks from the depot and test my balance, wielding my wooden sword with a quiet joy. The courts lie waiting, basketball and tennis, though long has it been since I played. My father and Mr. Graves instilled in us a love for tennis, and those times with my best friend remain etched in my memory, a testament to the pleasures found in toil. These memories linger, bright and steadfast, yet I hold to the belief that the finest days lie ahead, waiting to unfold.",
            "In this little township of Johnston, where the roads whisper through the fields and the sky stretches unbroken, there lies a quietude that belies its true worth. The land is stitched in rows of peach trees, a kingdom of fruit that marks its claim as the Peach Capital of the World, a title it wears with a proud humility upon its welcoming sign. The air is thick with the scent of earth and promise, a testament to the toil of those who work its soil. Houses are scattered across the land, standing solitary and watchful with their metal crowns or gray shingles, their distance from the road a testament to the land's purpose. They stand back, granting space for the fields to breathe and grow.\n\nIn the heart of Johnston, a lone traffic light sways above the crossroads, casting its red glow upon the handful of stores that gather there. Hong Kong, a modest family-run diner, serves its fare with the warmth of home. Fiesta Mexican and Gary’s, a small burger joint, round out the trifecta of quick eats. The pizzeria, once a staple, now lingers only in memory. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a pharmacy of small stature but great repute, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola, a sweet indulgence amid the medicinal shelves. The IGA grocery stands alone in its role, yet many journey to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their bounty, leaving the IGA for the quick necessities.\n\nDollar General, a bastion of the everyday, hums with life from dawn till dusk. Possibilities Furniture & More sits quietly, a repository of chairs and tables dreamed into being by a woman whose kindness is as much a fixture as the store itself. Her two movers, silent as shadows, bear the weight of new beginnings to doorsteps near and far. Beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels tends to the town's creatures with a gentle hand, offering pampering and care in equal measure.\n\nBeyond the reach of the town's center, the doctor and the vet hold their own courts, small yet capable, ready to mend man and beast alike. Johnston Elementary stands as the lone beacon of early education, sending its charges onward to the next town's schools when their time comes. The promise of a new park, a 2.5-acre haven in the making, whispers of future gatherings and laughter, a balm for the absence of theaters and bowling alleys, of playgrounds and promenades.\n\nJohnston is a place you might miss if you blink, a town where time seems to pause, caught in the gentle rhythm of its own making. Yet, for those who know it, it is a place of quiet significance, where the land and its people are entwined in a story as old as the hills themselves.",
            "In a small southern town in Tennessee, I find myself ensconced in a suburb that stretches between two state highways, a connector of sorts, where the flow of traffic ebbs and swells more than I care for. Yet despite this, a quietude blankets the neighborhood, a stillness interrupted only by the familiar rhythms of daily life. Folks here, they don't come and go as they might elsewhere. The faces are known, the names spoken in the same breath as the seasons.\n\nThe land is tended with diligence, yards pruned and preened, chores met with a resigned constancy. In the chill of winter, we take to sledding down the hill that slopes from the side street. Our house sits sentinel at the corner, a watchtower from which we observe the daily procession, each vehicle a known entity, each stranger's car noted with a careful eye. Neighbors take to walking, for exercise or company, dogs trotting faithfully beside them. Children wheel about on bicycles, a dance of innocence and laughter.\n\nWork anchors us at home, my wife and I, along with our daughters, sisters of eleven and fourteen years. Our comings and goings are as familiar to the neighborhood as the hum of lawn mowers that sing out from March to October. The trees, remnants of a forest past, cast their shadows, and in the fall, the leaves descend in a rustling avalanche, demanding rake and flame. The scent of their burning is a herald of autumn's reign.\n\nWinter has grown elusive, a fleeting specter, leaving us in the embrace of an extended fall. Our garage, tucked at the back, serves as both a workshop and a window to the world outside. On rare occasions when the front door is summoned, it is a reminder that life persists beyond our own.\n\nHolidays creep in with a quietude, the streets swelling with the return of kin, cars lining the curbs and driveways. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas—they come and go, leaving in their wake a deeper silence.\n\nIn all of this, there is a contentment, a satisfaction in the familiarity of place. Were it not for the road that cuts through, it might be perfect.",
            "In the midst of the high desert, my neighborhood sits, surrounded by the relentless expanse of dirt and more dirt, an unending sea of brown. It is a place where the sight of a green lawn is a rare spectacle, a testament to the homeowner’s resolve and the depths of their pockets. Back in the 90s, when I first laid my roots here, the houses were scattered and sparse, the land wide and open. It remains much the same today, though new structures creep in, pushing the boundaries of what was once untouched. The desert slowly takes on the guise of a city, a transformation not unfamiliar to many places. Yet, the heart of it remains, with folks who greet you with warmth, a kindness that speaks of simpler times. My corner of this place is blessed with the company of friendly old souls, a sanctuary of sorts.\n\nThe stores that line our streets are the usual suspects, Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, their chains stretching far and wide. For the upscale, one must journey beyond the familiar, for Whole Foods and the like are strangers here. Construction thrives in this landscape, the promise of development in every open space, a reminder of change that looms ever present. It unnerves me, this relentless march towards the future. I fled the clamor of the big city once, and I am loath to return. I work in construction, a drywall and T-bar installer by trade, and I find solace in the creatures of this desert land. \n\nThe high desert draws many, enchanted by its stark beauty and the life that clings to its harsh embrace. Its ecosystems are fragile, demanding our respect and understanding. My family has learned to coexist with the wildlife, and my children revel in the pursuit of lizards and desert insects, their laughter echoing under the vast sky. \n\nVictorville offers its own allure, a gateway for families to taste the desert’s unique flavor. The San Bernardino County Fair, a yearly spectacle, promises a blend of joy and tradition. Nearby, the snow-draped peaks of Wrightwood beckon, a call to winter’s embrace. For those drawn to the tales of the past, the Victor Valley Museum stands, a keeper of stories told through geological specimens and artifacts, a chronicle of Victorville’s journey through time.",
            "When it comes to describing my neighborhood, there's a certain peculiarity in the way it lays itself out in my mind. For most who'd answer such a question, they'd conjure up images of homes and streets and life unfolding in its ordinary ways. But mine is a different story. My neighborhood is the college campus where I dwell, and the souls in my dormitory make up the tapestry of my community. The campus itself, sprawling and indifferent, is the backdrop of this peculiar neighborhood, an extension of its reach, though less intimate.\n\nYet even in its strange constitution, my neighborhood shares echoes with the neighborhoods of old. It has its houses, its people, its stores, and its parks. Let's speak first of these \"houses\" that form the skeleton of my abode. The types of dwellings here are varied. There are apartments, true houses, and dormitory halls.\n\nIn the apartments, you'll find between two to four souls sharing a room, and each floor holds about four to six such rooms. The buildings rise for two floors typically, housing around twenty individuals. Then there are the houses, scarce and scattered, standing as relics for those tied to the institution, alumni mostly, who rent them out. They are fewer, less efficient in their scarcity. Lastly, the dormitories rise like ancient monoliths, sheltering hundreds of students. Here, two to a room is the rule, with exceptions that prove it, and this is the most common shelter where I lay my head.\n\nHaving covered housing, we turn now to the people. My school wears its diversity like a badge, and this is mirrored in the neighborhood's populace. People of every culture and age reside here. The professional staff find their place in the scattered houses, while the dormitories welcome the new arrivals, and the apartments become havens for those who have grown older in this place.\n\nYet to speak of these people in mere words is to do them a disservice. So let us move to the stores and parks. This self-contained world of my school has its own assortment of stores, a mixture of dining establishments akin to any neighborhood, alongside the unique branding of the school’s own shops for clothing and groceries. Within these bounds, all needs find their fulfillment.\n\nAnd then there is the park, a sanctuary for all, kept immaculate and safe through the collective efforts of the neighborhood's denizens, a testament to the diverse life that breathes within this peculiar, self-sustaining enclave.",
            "There are no sidewalks in this place. The earth falls away in long sweeping inclines and my house stands at the crest of the steepest hill, a monument to the incline's defiance. The folk around here call it the workout hill, a nod to the sweat and breath of joggers who labor against its grade. On my street, there is no stone path for walking, and folk take to the road. The road is pocked and scarred, a thing of danger underfoot and wheel alike. Wires hang in weblike tangles, their tattered strands a testament to the storms that rage and the arboreal debris that tears them asunder, the scars of their mending etched in patchwork. Tall evergreens stand in solemn watch, casting their shadows long and deep. Yet the people here loathe these ancient sentinels, for they block the ocean's visage. Houses rise high on the hill, glass-fronted monoliths reaching for the bay's distant embrace. Come sunset, the water glows with a fire from beneath, the sky a canvas washed in orange. But clouds, more frequent than not, shroud these visions with their pallor. The days are gray and damp, and a green moss creeps over all things, roofs and cars and railings alike. Once, a month gone by, my car lay untouched, and when I came to it, the moss had claimed it as its own. It took me hours to strip it bare, its surface green and furred. Children are scarce, though a school stands not far away. The folk here are mostly of age, their work behind them. In place of children, there are dogs, a common sight on lawns or in chase down the street. Leave a door unguarded and you may find one in your parlor, as I did, only to shoo it out again. Rabbits roam wild and free, the gardeners their sworn enemies for the burrows and uprooted plants they leave in their wake. My cats, they revel in the hunt, and the rabbits know their days are numbered. Birds flit and flutter, sparrows and hummingbirds in their finery, while hawks and eagles are driven off by the crow's black malice. Stores are absent here, but a trek downhill to the shore reveals eateries where the sea's bounty is served. The beach is but a rocky margin, yet to cast stones into the bay is a joy of sorts. The bay is narrow, and even in the mist, the far shore is clear to the eye.",
            "In the borough of Brooklyn, where the city sprawls out in iron and stone, there lies a neighborhood called Bensonhurst. It is not hard to find. The veins of public transportation run through it like blood through the body of the city, and the trains clatter along the tracks in their ceaseless rhythm. You’ll find yourself in the heart of the city, amidst its urban cadence and the ever-watchful gaze of its towering edifices. As you walk the streets, you’ll see storefronts adorned with bright signs and the delicate calligraphy of a distant land. For in these past decades, many from across the vast reaches of Asia have come to make this place their own. At every turn, there’s a market or a laundromat, their doors open to the hurrying throngs, and the air is rich with the scent of spices and the chatter of languages. These shops are beloved by the locals for their bounty, their prices, and the ease with which they weave into the lives of those who dwell here. Just a stone’s throw from where I stand, four markets line the street, each a testament to the neighborhood’s newfound heritage.\n\nBut Bensonhurst is more than this. It is a tapestry of lives, stitched together by the hands of immigrants, their children, and their children’s children. And though the larger businesses may bear the mark of Asian ownership, the park nearby, newly touched by the hand of renovation, offers a place for all. There stand basketball courts, fields for the games of soccer and baseball, and swings where children’s laughter dances on the wind. Here, the water fountain sparkles under the summer sun, a brief respite from the city’s heat. And you’ll see the colors of the world in the faces that gather there, united in play and the common language of joy.\n\nIn this place, the sky is not broken by the hard lines of corporate towers. Instead, the buildings are homes, co-ops and condominiums, two-family houses where life spills out into the streets. The people are friendly, their voices a constant hum in the air, yet the roar of engines and the blare of music are their heralds, echoing through the dawn and into the night. Come nightfall, tread with care, for though the streets are safe, the hearts of men are ever unpredictable. There are those who might seek mischief, the bullies and the thieves who haunt the shadows. I have felt their malice in years past, yet time has softened their blows. But the thieves remain, their eyes set upon the packages left unguarded.\n\nAnd there is the matter of dogs. Their presence is marked not by their barking, but by the leavings they scatter upon the sidewalks. The city demands their owners clean the mess, but the rule is often ignored. It is a small thing, yet it rankles, a reminder of the city's untamed spirit. As you walk, watch your step, and keep your shoes clean, for the streets of Bensonhurst are as wild as they are welcoming.",
            "The first thing a soul must reckon with about Portland, Oregon, is the meaning of \"weird.\" There's a saying daubed on the backside of a building that juggles the trifecta of pizza, liquor, and music, with a foot in the shadows of law's good graces, and it reads \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, it's a whispered echo of the Portland of the nineties and early aughts, a time when it was a quieter place, less burdened by fame's high price, a crucible of strange and wondrous subcultures. To others, it's a siren's call to the quirky and the odd, a place where \"weird\" is a crown to wear, not a scarlet letter. Despite the tide of wealth from Californian shores and the rise of steel and glass to house them, Portland holds fast to its weirdness. Weird doesn't equate to universal acceptance, but rather a tolerance for the unusual, the peculiar. It does not shun the comforts of modernity nor the battles they wage. Like every corner of this vast country, our shelves are stocked with goods from distant lands. There are myriad paths to strangeness, to deviation from the norm, yet Portland is rife with the ordinary. Yoga mats unfurl beneath hipsters and suits alike. Perhaps in Portland, weirdness means we dance through the mundane with a lighter step. In the neighborhood where I dwell, as in many corners of this city, there are homes ablaze with color, gardens tended with care, and in the summer, boxes left for free on the sidewalks. These boxes, more often than not, are humble cardboard vessels of discarded items, yet they hold something mystical, a boon for the passerby who dares to look. They brim with clothes and tomes but could contain anything. This serendipity of wandering through Southeast Portland captures its essence. At least, it does for me, though I am but one shade of weird among a spectrum. There are those among us who wouldn't deign to dress from a box on the street. They find joy amidst bleating goats in yoga or in the roar of the Timbers' faithful. Portland teems with souls chasing their dreams or dreaming within the amber haze of barroom light. Yes, Portland wrestles with its demons, the grip of substances a symptom of deeper wounds, perhaps exacerbated by the endless drizzle and sullen skies. There is a specter of homelessness too, a puzzle without a solver. The city's open arms, more generous than most, draw them near, but even here, the help falls short. The housed walk a line between compassion and disdain. In this, we are no stranger than any other place.",
            "The mountains loom eternal, an ancient witness to the sun's path, morning to night. They stand, immutable and indifferent to the whirl of human concerns, a steadfast presence against the fleeting moments of life. Oftentimes, in the thick of daily toil and turmoil, they fade from my mind, yet they remain, silent and stalwart. On days when the weight of the world bears down, they call out to be seen, and I turn to them. They offer solace to my weary spirit, a quiet strength urging me onward, step by step. \n\nI came to this place when my scholarly journey began, drawn by the mountains that guard the northern edge of the campus. The university itself boasts wonders in its edifices and ponds and trees, each staking a claim on my heart, yet it is the mountains that hold dominion. The town sprawls in its own beauty, a mosaic of cafes where time melts away in caffeinated frenzy. Venture further and the downtown wraps around you, its faded brick and mortar echoing a bygone era, a testament to the bustle and vigor that rivals the neighboring metropolis. \n\nBut this fervor is fleeting, giving way to the tranquil embrace of the small town, past the library's solemn walls. This duality, so close yet worlds apart, imbues the city with a mystique that begs exploration. Here, memories weave themselves into the fabric of the streets, each tied to a place. The rusted swings of the park, the hurried dash through downtown to the theater, the university's gift of cinema. Yet, like all places in life, it is home to shadows as well. The ponds, a sanctuary for contemplation, bear witness to tears shed in the silent hours of night, in the throes of existential dread. \n\nI have found myself there often, pondering the turtles and ducks, each creature playing its part in the grand tapestry of existence. I wondered then, lost in the labyrinth of life, about my own place and purpose. I walked on, past the pond, the park, the suburbia's quiet houses, until I reached the main street. There, the sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky in hues of dawn, and I looked up to see I was heading north. And there they were, as ever, the towering mountains brushing the heavens with their ancient peaks, voiceless yet stirring within me a resolve as old as the earth itself.",
            "You might pass it by at first, your eyes skimming over the unremarkable facade of a residential district set behind a strip of stores. It's not the kind of place that leaps out as a place to live, and certainly not one that most would choose to call home. Yet if you wander past the old Whole Foods, its doors long closed to the world, and slip behind the hotels that stir to life but once a year, you'll stumble upon a lively community unknown to the unseeing eye. These streets are lined with apartment complexes, assembled with the precision of Russian dolls, each one placed carefully beside the other in a row that stretches down the road like a tale being told in chapters. The first buildings you come upon have gained notoriety for unsavory affairs, tales best left untold, for appearances can deceive. But there are other complexes, worlds unto themselves, their existence a secret kept from the larger world. Across from these apartments stands a satellite campus of a community college, the buildings quiet and unassuming, where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, sleep still clinging to their eyes at the break of day. The gates groan open to admit them, while irate drivers bemoan the delay in their morning commute, the sound of their frustration echoing in the still air. The road meets another residential street, where a park shares a corner with a rehabilitation center for the broken-bodied. The center, with its inviting porch and languid ceiling fan, seems to breathe in the heavy summer air. Children play in the park across the way, their laughter rising above the hum of bees amongst the flowers by the roadside. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, casting disapproving glances at the skateboarders and nodding at the teenage girls who whisper secrets by the swings. Beside the park, a sushi place offers modest fare to few patrons, flanked by a swimming supply store and a nail salon, each a cog in the wheel of the strip mall's charm. Here one could attend to the season's needs all at once—fill a pool, polish nails, and savor hibachi chicken. A frozen yogurt shop invites the youth, who navigate the park with cups in hand, their toppings melting in the sun's embrace as they ride their boards and exhale vapor into the heat. This neighborhood, a slice of Americana, holds fast to its history in the somnolent South, where change comes as slowly as the turning of the earth.",
            "In the place where I live, there's a peculiar rhythm that clings to the bones of the earth. The houses stand solitary, mostly, though here and there you find one cleaved into two like a great beast bisected, yet still tethered together. My own dwelling has a patch of earth for a yard and a narrow strip of pavement for a drive. It is a remnant of a time not so distant when the suburbs were the promise of a new world, a dream woven into the fabric of the American vision. Once, this promise held the people in its embrace, but now it seems to slip away. Yet our neighborhood endures, a testament to dreams that refuse to die, voices still calling to those who wander through, whispering that the dream lingers still, though perhaps more tenuously than before.\n\nThe folks here don't carry the same spark of hope as once they did. The tidy patches of green have grown weary, but cars still rest in the drives, and the children, unaware, play as though the world they know is the only one that matters. The old school, standing for nearly ninety years, remains a structure of hope for the young, a vessel of memory for the elders. Churches are sparse, their pews often empty, but the courts echo with the sound of basketballs and laughter. Each home has its own face but shares a common soul.\n\nA great supermarket, Super \"A\", stands, run by a Yemeni family, perhaps the only Arabs among us. The community is largely African American, the streets generous in their width, where children play their games, pausing only for the passing cars. Generations have settled here, people who can spin tales of a time when every face was familiar. A karate school once flourished, but with the waning of Hollywood's martial arts tales, it vanished, replaced by a pharmacy, for medicines are the new talismans, or so they say. There's a small theater showing films of yesteryear, a sanctuary for the old who find solace in the stories of the past, a place where they can escape without the clamor of youth.\n\nAn expressway cuts through the town, though its entrance and exit lie beyond our borders. There was talk once of petitioning for our own access, the younger ones eager, the elders wary. The threat of change and the wisdom of age led to its rejection, preserving a way of life they feared would be lost. Now, a new high school rises, and we ponder what symbol shall represent us. I reckon a cyborg with a drawl and a log cabin might just capture the spirit of this place.",
            "In the sprawling expanse of the city, where the towers rise like ancient sentinels and the streets weave a labyrinthine course through the heart of human enterprise, my neighborhood stands, a mosaic of disparate lives and ambitions. Here, the domiciles scatter themselves with a randomness that seems ordained by some capricious hand, interspersed with the commerce of men, their offices and shops, their eateries and theaters, all clamoring for space and attention. There is no end to the newness of restaurants, the novelty of stores, each one a testament to the ceaseless churn of society's appetite. The thoroughfares are lined with establishments both grand and obscure, the mighty chains of corporations standing shoulder to shoulder with the humble boutiques, each a sanctuary for the curious and the jaded alike.\n\nThe streets themselves, a testament to the city's ceaseless pulse, gird quiet enclaves that might have known serenity were they not encircled by such relentless activity. Parks, sparse yet treasured, offer a refuge where the young are brought to frolic under the watchful eyes of their guardians. And the people, oh the people, a tapestry of humanity woven from threads of every hue and creed. Within a stone's throw, the vibrant embrace of the LGBTQ+ community stands alongside the devout lives of Orthodox Jews, while those who fled the shadows of the old Soviet lands seek a new dawn here.\n\nBeyond, the city's great expanse unfurls more enclaves, each a world unto itself. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, each a bastion of culture and history, yet the road to these places is a trial in itself, for the city's veins are clogged with the lifeblood of its denizens, a mere ten miles a marathon of endurance through the gridlocked arteries of asphalt.\n\nIn this city, few tread the paths that once bore the weight of footfalls. The distances are vast, the hearts weary, and the preference is for wheels over soles. Thus, the city chokes on its own growth, the new edifices rising in defiance of the limits, promising homes yet bringing only the specter of further congestion. And yet, within this urban sprawl, the homes themselves bear witness to life's diversity. From the towering apartments to the modest homes, the duplexes and condominiums, each stands as a testament to the varied aspirations of its inhabitants.\n\nThe people too, a multitude of ages and stories, yet I find myself a stranger among them, the bonds of community frayed by the passage of time. The memories linger still, of childhood days spent in the company of neighbors, the laughter shared and the innocence preserved. But now, the ties that bound us have loosened, and we are left adrift in this vast sea, each of us a solitary island in a city that never sleeps.",
            "Where is everything she asked as we passed the cornfields that stretched out to the horizon. This is it I said with the knowing that she’d be taken aback by the vastness and the emptiness of the land. She was from a place where the grocery store was but a short walk from her door and she’d never seen such open space in all her life. I told her of what it was to grow up in the rural heart of Ohio and in that telling she came to know what I was and where I came from. The country road was two lanes wide and it led to a quarry filled with water. Beyond it lay the small development where I lived. Brick and stucco houses stood solitary on their half-acre plots where the people took pride in their keeping. In the springtime the flowers bloomed and the trees of the Midwest changed with the seasons. Driveways held the finest Mercedes Benz cars that gleamed under the midday sun after a good washing. Down the road toward my grey stucco home my Korean neighbor stood outside with a friendly face. He spent his days mowing his lawn and his singing rose above the hum of the mower. The neighborhood laughed with him for he was a genuine soul with a past of his own. He had grown older and his wits had dulled with time. Once he’d been a doctor but now he blended in with the grass and his John Deere mower. At last you’ll find my home. Geese abound in the side yard with our Terrier in chase. In the back a stream fed into the quarry and there you could hear the bullfrogs and the water and sometimes the lowing of cows from distant farms. Across a bridge of wood was an untouched place where trees and herbs and wildflowers grew as they would. Here was where my childhood played out. We built forts in the trees and hunted animals that were mostly just chased away and there was ever a neighborhood child for company. The winters in that small town could be harsh but they held a beauty all their own. The yard turned from a sea of green to a barren wilderness. The trees that had borne flowers of pink and purple and orange became skeletons of bark. When the snow came it was a wonderland that appeared by night’s end. The backyard was littered with snow angels my sister had made and snowmen stood guard. My sister and I fought often as children and in winter our weapon was the snowball. We built great forts like igloos to store our ammo and branches for our arsenal. In that wonderland we played and pretended and for a time nothing else mattered. We were just children without a care in the world."
